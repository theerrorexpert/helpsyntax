Usage: brew deps [options] [formula|cask ...]

Show dependencies for formula. Additional options specific to formula may be
appended to the command. When given multiple formula arguments, show the
intersection of dependencies for each formula.

  -n                               Sort dependencies in topological order.
      --1                          Only show dependencies one level down,
                                   instead of recursing.
      --union                      Show the union of dependencies for multiple
                                   formula, instead of the intersection.
      --full-name                  List dependencies by their full name.
      --include-build              Include :build dependencies for formula.
      --include-optional           Include :optional dependencies for
                                   formula.
      --include-test               Include :test dependencies for formula
                                   (non-recursive).
      --skip-recommended           Skip :recommended dependencies for
                                   formula.
      --include-requirements       Include requirements in addition to
                                   dependencies for formula.
      --tree                       Show dependencies as a tree. When given
                                   multiple formula arguments, show individual
                                   trees for each formula.
      --graph                      Show dependencies as a directed graph.
      --dot                        Show text-based graph description in DOT
                                   format.
      --annotate                   Mark any build, test, optional, or
                                   recommended dependencies as such in the
                                   output.
      --installed                  List dependencies for formulae that are
                                   currently installed. If formula is
                                   specified, list only its dependencies that
                                   are currently installed.
      --all                        List dependencies for all available formulae.
      --for-each                   Switch into the mode used by the --all
                                   option, but only list dependencies for each
                                   provided formula, one formula per line.
                                   This is used for debugging the
                                   --installed/--all display mode.
      --formula, --formulae        Treat all named arguments as formulae.
      --cask, --casks              Treat all named arguments as casks.
  -d, --debug                      Display any debugging information.
  -q, --quiet                      Make some output more quiet.
  -v, --verbose                    Make some output more verbose.
  -h, --help                       Show this message.
