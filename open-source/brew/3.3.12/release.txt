Usage: brew release [--major] [--minor]

Create a new draft Homebrew/brew release with the appropriate version number and
release notes.

By default, brew release will bump the patch version number. Pass --major or
--minor to bump the major or minor version numbers, respectively. The command
will fail if the previous major or minor release was made less than one month
ago.

Requires write access to the Homebrew/brew repository.
