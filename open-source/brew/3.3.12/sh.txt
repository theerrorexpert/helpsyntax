Usage: brew sh [--env=] [--cmd=] [file]

Enter an interactive shell for Homebrew's build environment. Use
years-battle-hardened build logic to help your ./configure && make && make
install and even your gem install succeed. Especially handy if you run
Homebrew in an Xcode-only configuration since it adds tools like make to your
PATH which build systems would not find otherwise.

      --env                        Use the standard PATH instead of superenv's
                                   when std is passed.
  -c, --cmd                        Execute commands in a non-interactive shell.
  -d, --debug                      Display any debugging information.
  -q, --quiet                      Make some output more quiet.
  -v, --verbose                    Make some output more verbose.
  -h, --help                       Show this message.
