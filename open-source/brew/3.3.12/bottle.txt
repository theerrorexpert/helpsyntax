Usage: brew bottle [options] installed_formula|file [...]

Generate a bottle (binary package) from a formula that was installed with
--build-bottle. If the formula specifies a rebuild version, it will be
incremented in the generated DSL. Passing --keep-old will attempt to keep it
at its original value, while --no-rebuild will remove it.

      --skip-relocation            Do not check if the bottle can be marked as
                                   relocatable.
      --force-core-tap             Build a bottle even if formula is not in
                                   homebrew/core or any installed taps.
      --no-rebuild                 If the formula specifies a rebuild version,
                                   remove it from the generated DSL.
      --keep-old                   If the formula specifies a rebuild version,
                                   attempt to preserve its value in the
                                   generated DSL.
      --json                       Write bottle information to a JSON file,
                                   which can be used as the value for --merge.
      --merge                      Generate an updated bottle block for a
                                   formula and optionally merge it into the
                                   formula file. Instead of a formula name,
                                   requires the path to a JSON file generated
                                   with brew bottle --json formula.
      --write                      Write changes to the formula file. A new
                                   commit will be generated unless --no-commit
                                   is passed.
      --no-commit                  When passed with --write, a new commit will
                                   not generated after writing changes to the
                                   formula file.
      --only-json-tab              When passed with --json, the tab will be
                                   written to the JSON file but not the bottle.
      --committer                  Specify a committer name and email in git's
                                   standard author format.
      --root-url                   Use the specified URL as the root of the
                                   bottle's URL instead of Homebrew's default.
      --root-url-using             Use the specified download strategy class for
                                   downloading the bottle's URL instead of
                                   Homebrew's default.
  -d, --debug                      Display any debugging information.
  -q, --quiet                      Make some output more quiet.
  -v, --verbose                    Make some output more verbose.
  -h, --help                       Show this message.
