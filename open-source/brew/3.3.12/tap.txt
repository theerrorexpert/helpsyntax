Usage: brew tap [options] [user/repo] [URL]

Tap a formula repository.

If no arguments are provided, list all installed taps.

With URL unspecified, tap a formula repository from GitHub using HTTPS. Since
so many taps are hosted on GitHub, this command is a shortcut for brew tap
user/repo https://github.com/user/homebrew-repo.

With URL specified, tap a formula repository from anywhere, using any
transport protocol that git(1) handles. The one-argument form of tap
simplifies but also limits. This two-argument command makes no assumptions, so
taps can be cloned from places other than GitHub and using protocols other than
HTTPS, e.g. SSH, git, HTTP, FTP(S), rsync.

      --full                       Convert a shallow clone to a full clone
                                   without untapping. Taps are only cloned as
                                   shallow clones if --shallow was originally
                                   passed. (disabled)
      --shallow                    Fetch tap as a shallow clone rather than a
                                   full clone. Useful for continuous
                                   integration. (disabled)
      --force-auto-update          Auto-update tap even if it is not hosted on
                                   GitHub. By default, only taps hosted on
                                   GitHub are auto-updated (for performance
                                   reasons).
      --custom-remote              Install or change a tap with a custom remote.
                                   Useful for mirrors.
      --repair                     Migrate tapped formulae from symlink-based to
                                   directory-based structure.
      --list-pinned                List all pinned taps.
  -d, --debug                      Display any debugging information.
  -q, --quiet                      Make some output more quiet.
  -v, --verbose                    Make some output more verbose.
  -h, --help                       Show this message.
