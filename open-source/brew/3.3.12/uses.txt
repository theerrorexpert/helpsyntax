Usage: brew uses [options] formula [...]

Show formulae and casks that specify formula as a dependency; that is, show
dependents of formula. When given multiple formula arguments, show the
intersection of formulae that use formula. By default, uses shows all
formulae and casks that specify formula as a required or recommended
dependency for their stable builds.

      --recursive                  Resolve more than one level of dependencies.
      --installed                  Only list formulae and casks that are
                                   currently installed.
      --include-build              Include all formulae that specify formula
                                   as :build type dependency.
      --include-test               Include all formulae that specify formula
                                   as :test type dependency.
      --include-optional           Include all formulae that specify formula
                                   as :optional type dependency.
      --skip-recommended           Skip all formulae that specify formula as
                                   :recommended type dependency.
      --formula, --formulae        Include only formulae.
      --cask, --casks              Include only casks.
  -d, --debug                      Display any debugging information.
  -q, --quiet                      Make some output more quiet.
  -v, --verbose                    Make some output more verbose.
  -h, --help                       Show this message.
