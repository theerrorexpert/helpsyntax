Usage: brew outdated [options] [formula|cask ...]

List installed casks and formulae that have an updated version available. By
default, version information is displayed in interactive shells, and suppressed
otherwise.

  -q, --quiet                      List only the names of outdated kegs (takes
                                   precedence over --verbose).
  -v, --verbose                    Include detailed version information.
      --formula, --formulae        List only outdated formulae.
      --cask, --casks              List only outdated casks.
      --json                       Print output in JSON format. There are two
                                   versions: v1 and v2. v1 is deprecated
                                   and is currently the default if no version is
                                   specified. v2 prints outdated formulae and
                                   casks.
      --fetch-HEAD                 Fetch the upstream repository to detect if
                                   the HEAD installation of the formula is
                                   outdated. Otherwise, the repository's HEAD
                                   will only be checked for updates when a new
                                   stable or development version has been
                                   released.
      --greedy                     Print outdated casks with auto_updates true
                                   or version :latest.
      --greedy-latest              Print outdated casks including those with
                                   version :latest.
      --greedy-auto-updates        Print outdated casks including those with
                                   auto_updates true.
  -d, --debug                      Display any debugging information.
  -h, --help                       Show this message.
