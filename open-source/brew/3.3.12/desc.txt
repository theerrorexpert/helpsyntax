Usage: brew desc [options] formula|text|/regex/ [...]

Display formula's name and one-line description. Formula descriptions are
cached; the cache is created on the first search, making that search slower than
subsequent ones.

                                   text. If text is flanked by slashes, it
                                   is interpreted as a regular expression.

                                   flanked by slashes, it is interpreted as a
                                   regular expression.
  -d, --description                Search just descriptions for text. If
                                   text is flanked by slashes, it is
                                   interpreted as a regular expression.
