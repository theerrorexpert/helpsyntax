Usage: brew bump-formula-pr [options] [formula]

Create a pull request to update formula with a new URL or a new tag.

If a URL is specified, the SHA-256 checksum of the new download should also
be specified. A best effort to determine the SHA-256 and formula name will
be made if either or both values are not supplied by the user.

If a tag is specified, the Git commit revision corresponding to that tag
should also be specified. A best effort to determine the revision will be made
if the value is not supplied by the user.

If a version is specified, a best effort to determine the URL and SHA-256
or the tag and revision will be made if both values are not supplied by the
user.

Note: this command cannot be used to transition a formula from a
URL-and-SHA-256 style specification into a tag-and-revision style specification,
nor vice versa. It must use whichever style specification the formula already
uses.

  -n, --dry-run                    Print what would be done rather than doing
                                   it.
      --write-only                 Make the expected file modifications without
                                   taking any Git actions.
      --commit                     When passed with --write-only, generate a
                                   new commit after writing changes to the
                                   formula file.
      --no-audit                   Don't run brew audit before opening the PR.
      --strict                     Run brew audit --strict before opening the
                                   PR.
      --online                     Run brew audit --online before opening the
                                   PR.
      --no-browse                  Print the pull request URL instead of opening
                                   in a browser.
      --no-fork                    Don't try to fork the repository.
      --mirror                     Use the specified URL as a mirror URL. If
                                   URL is a comma-separated list of URLs,
                                   multiple mirrors will be added.
      --fork-org                   Use the specified GitHub organization for
                                   forking.
      --version                    Use the specified version to override the
                                   value parsed from the URL or tag. Note that
                                   --version=0 can be used to delete an
                                   existing version override from a formula if
                                   it has become redundant.
      --message                    Append message to the default pull request
                                   message.
      --url                        Specify the URL for the new download. If a
                                   URL is specified, the SHA-256 checksum of
                                   the new download should also be specified.
      --sha256                     Specify the SHA-256 checksum of the new
                                   download.
      --tag                        Specify the new git commit tag for the
                                   formula.
      --revision                   Specify the new commit revision
                                   corresponding to the specified git tag or
                                   specified version.
  -f, --force                      Ignore duplicate open PRs. Remove all mirrors
                                   if --mirror was not specified.
  -d, --debug                      Display any debugging information.
  -q, --quiet                      Make some output more quiet.
  -v, --verbose                    Make some output more verbose.
  -h, --help                       Show this message.
