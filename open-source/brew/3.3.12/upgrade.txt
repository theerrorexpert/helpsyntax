Usage: brew upgrade [options] [outdated_formula|outdated_cask ...]

Upgrade outdated casks and outdated, unpinned formulae using the same options
they were originally installed with, plus any appended brew formula options. If
cask or formula are specified, upgrade only the given cask or formula
kegs (unless they are pinned; see pin, unpin).

Unless HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALLED_DEPENDENTS_CHECK is set, brew upgrade or brew
reinstall will be run for outdated dependents and dependents with broken
linkage, respectively.

Unless HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP is set, brew cleanup will then be run for
the upgraded formulae or, every 30 days, for all formulae.

  -d, --debug                      If brewing fails, open an interactive
                                   debugging session with access to IRB or a
                                   shell inside the temporary build directory.
  -f, --force                      Install formulae without checking for
                                   previously installed keg-only or non-migrated
                                   versions. When installing casks, overwrite
                                   existing files (binaries and symlinks are
                                   excluded, unless originally from the same
                                   cask).
  -v, --verbose                    Print the verification and postinstall steps.
  -n, --dry-run                    Show what would be upgraded, but do not
                                   actually upgrade anything.
      --formula, --formulae        Treat all named arguments as formulae. If no
                                   named arguments are specified, upgrade only
                                   outdated formulae.
  -s, --build-from-source          Compile formula from source even if a
                                   bottle is available.
  -i, --interactive                Download and patch formula, then open a
                                   shell. This allows the user to run
                                   ./configure --help and otherwise determine
                                   how to turn the software package into a
                                   Homebrew package.
      --force-bottle               Install from a bottle if it exists for the
                                   current or newest version of macOS, even if
                                   it would not normally be used for
                                   installation.
      --fetch-HEAD                 Fetch the upstream repository to detect if
                                   the HEAD installation of the formula is
                                   outdated. Otherwise, the repository's HEAD
                                   will only be checked for updates when a new
                                   stable or development version has been
                                   released.
      --ignore-pinned              Set a successful exit status even if pinned
                                   formulae are not upgraded.
      --keep-tmp                   Retain the temporary files created during
                                   installation.
      --display-times              Print install times for each package at the
                                   end of the run.
      --cask, --casks              Treat all named arguments as casks. If no
                                   named arguments are specified, upgrade only
                                   outdated casks.
      --[no-]binaries              Disable/enable linking of helper executables
                                   (default: enabled).

      --[no-]quarantine            Disable/enable quarantining of downloads
                                   (default: enabled).
      --skip-cask-deps             Skip installing cask dependencies.
