Usage: brew link, ln [options] installed_formula [...]

Symlink all of formula's installed files into Homebrew's prefix. This is done
automatically when you install formulae but can be useful for DIY installations.

      --overwrite                  Delete files that already exist in the prefix
                                   while linking.
  -n, --dry-run                    List files which would be linked or deleted
                                   by brew link --overwrite without actually
                                   linking or deleting any files.
  -f, --force                      Allow keg-only formulae to be linked.
      --HEAD                       Link the HEAD version of the formula if it is
                                   installed.
  -d, --debug                      Display any debugging information.
  -q, --quiet                      Make some output more quiet.
  -v, --verbose                    Make some output more verbose.
  -h, --help                       Show this message.
