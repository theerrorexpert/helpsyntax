Usage: brew extract [--version=] [--force] formula tap

Look through repository history to find the most recent version of formula and
create a copy in tap. Specifically, the command will create the new formula
file at tap/Formula/formula@version.rb. If the tap is not installed
yet, attempt to install/clone the tap before continuing. To extract a formula
from a tap that is not homebrew/core use its fully-qualified form of
user/repo/formula.

      --version                    Extract the specified version of formula
                                   instead of the most recent.
  -f, --force                      Overwrite the destination formula if it
                                   already exists.
  -d, --debug                      Display any debugging information.
  -q, --quiet                      Make some output more quiet.
  -v, --verbose                    Make some output more verbose.
  -h, --help                       Show this message.
