Usage: brew cleanup [options] [formula|cask ...]

Remove stale lock files and outdated downloads for all formulae and casks, and
remove old versions of installed formulae. If arguments are specified, only do
this for the given formulae and casks. Removes all downloads more than 120 days
old. This can be adjusted with HOMEBREW_CLEANUP_MAX_AGE_DAYS.

      --prune                      Remove all cache files older than specified
                                   days. If you want to remove everything, use
                                   --prune=all.
  -n, --dry-run                    Show what would be removed, but do not
                                   actually remove anything.
  -s                               Scrub the cache, including downloads for even
                                   the latest versions. Note that downloads for
                                   any installed formulae or casks will still
                                   not be deleted. If you want to delete those
                                   too: rm -rf "$(brew --cache)"
      --prune-prefix               Only prune the symlinks and directories from
                                   the prefix and remove no other files.
  -d, --debug                      Display any debugging information.
  -q, --quiet                      Make some output more quiet.
  -v, --verbose                    Make some output more verbose.
  -h, --help                       Show this message.
