Usage: brew generate-man-completions [--fail-if-not-changed]

Generate Homebrew's manpages and shell completions.

      --fail-if-not-changed        Return a failing status code if no changes
                                   are detected in the manpage outputs. This can
                                   be used to notify CI when the manpages are
                                   out of date. Additionally, the date used in
                                   new manpages will match those in the existing
                                   manpages (to allow comparison without
                                   factoring in the date).
  -d, --debug                      Display any debugging information.
  -q, --quiet                      Make some output more quiet.
  -v, --verbose                    Make some output more verbose.
  -h, --help                       Show this message.
