Usage: packer hcl2_upgrade [options] TEMPLATE

  Will transform your JSON template into an HCL2 configuration.

Options:

  -output-file=path    Set output file name. By default this will be the
                       TEMPLATE name with ".pkr.hcl" appended to it. To be a
                       valid Packer HCL template, it must have the suffix
                       ".pkr.hcl"
  -with-annotations    Add helper annotation comments to the file to help new
                       HCL2 users understand the template format.
