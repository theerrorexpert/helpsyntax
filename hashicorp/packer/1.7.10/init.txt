Usage: packer init [options] [config.pkr.hcl|folder/]

  Install all the missing plugins required in a Packer config. Note that Packer
  does not have a state.

  This is the first command that should be executed when working with a new
  or existing template.

  This command is always safe to run multiple times. Though subsequent runs may
  give errors, this command will never delete anything.

Options:
  -upgrade                     On top of installing missing plugins, update
                               installed plugins to the latest available
                               version, if there is a new higher one. Note that
                               this still takes into consideration the version
                               constraint of the config.
