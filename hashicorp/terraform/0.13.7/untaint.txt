Usage: terraform untaint [options] name

  Manually unmark a resource as tainted, restoring it as the primary
  instance in the state.  This reverses either a manual 'terraform taint'
  or the result of provisioners failing on a resource.

  This will not modify your infrastructure. This command changes your
  state to unmark a resource as tainted.  This command can be undone by
  reverting the state backup file that is created, or by running
  'terraform taint' on the resource.

Options:

  -allow-missing      If specified, the command will succeed (exit code 0)
                      even if the resource is missing.

  -backup=path        Path to backup the existing state file before
                      modifying. Defaults to the "-state-out" path with
                      ".backup" extension. Set to "-" to disable backup.

  -lock=true          Lock the state file when locking is supported.

  -lock-timeout=0s    Duration to retry a state lock.

  -module=path        The module path where the resource lives. By
                      default this will be root. Child modules can be specified
                      by names. Ex. "consul" or "consul.vpc" (nested modules).

  -state=path         Path to read and save state (unless state-out
                      is specified). Defaults to "terraform.tfstate".

  -state-out=path     Path to write updated state file. By default, the
                      "-state" path will be used.
