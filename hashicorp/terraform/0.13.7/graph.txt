Usage: terraform graph [options] [DIR]

  Outputs the visual execution graph of Terraform resources according to
  configuration files in DIR (or the current directory if omitted).

  The graph is outputted in DOT format. The typical program that can
  read this format is GraphViz, but many web services are also available
  to read this format.

  The -type flag can be used to control the type of graph shown. Terraform
  creates different graphs for different operations. See the options below
  for the list of types supported. The default type is "plan" if a
  configuration is given, and "apply" if a plan file is passed as an
  argument.

Options:

  -draw-cycles     Highlight any cycles in the graph with colored edges.
                   This helps when diagnosing cycle errors.

  -type=plan       Type of graph to output. Can be: plan, plan-destroy, apply,
                   validate, input, refresh.

  -module-depth=n  (deprecated) In prior versions of Terraform, specified the
				   depth of modules to show in the output.
