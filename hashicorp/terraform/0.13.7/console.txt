Usage: terraform console [options] [DIR]

  Starts an interactive console for experimenting with Terraform
  interpolations.

  This will open an interactive console that you can use to type
  interpolations into and inspect their values. This command loads the
  current state. This lets you explore and test interpolations before
  using them in future configurations.

  This command will never modify your state.

  DIR can be set to a directory with a Terraform state to load. By
  default, this will default to the current working directory.

Options:

  -state=path            Path to read state. Defaults to "terraform.tfstate"

  -var 'foo=bar'         Set a variable in the Terraform configuration. This
                         flag can be set multiple times.

  -var-file=foo          Set variables in the Terraform configuration from
                         a file. If "terraform.tfvars" or any ".auto.tfvars"
                         files are present, they will be automatically loaded.
