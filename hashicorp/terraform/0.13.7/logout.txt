Usage: terraform logout [hostname]

  Removes locally-stored credentials for specified hostname.

  Note: the API token is only removed from local storage, not destroyed on the
  remote server, so it will remain valid until manually revoked.

  If no hostname is provided, the default hostname is app.terraform.io.
