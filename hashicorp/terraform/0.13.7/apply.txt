Usage: terraform apply [options] [DIR-OR-PLAN]

  Builds or changes infrastructure according to Terraform configuration
  files in DIR.

  By default, apply scans the current directory for the configuration
  and applies the changes appropriately. However, a path to another
  configuration or an execution plan can be provided. Execution plans can be
  used to only execute a pre-determined set of actions.

Options:

  -auto-approve          Skip interactive approval of plan before applying.

  -backup=path           Path to backup the existing state file before
                         modifying. Defaults to the "-state-out" path with
                         ".backup" extension. Set to "-" to disable backup.

  -compact-warnings      If Terraform produces any warnings that are not
                         accompanied by errors, show them in a more compact
                         form that includes only the summary messages.

  -lock=true             Lock the state file when locking is supported.

  -lock-timeout=0s       Duration to retry a state lock.

  -input=true            Ask for input for variables if not directly set.

  -no-color              If specified, output won't contain any color.

  -parallelism=n         Limit the number of parallel resource operations.
                         Defaults to 10.

  -refresh=true          Update state prior to checking for differences. This
                         has no effect if a plan file is given to apply.

  -state=path            Path to read and save state (unless state-out
                         is specified). Defaults to "terraform.tfstate".

  -state-out=path        Path to write state to that is different than
                         "-state". This can be used to preserve the old
                         state.

  -target=resource       Resource to target. Operation will be limited to this
                         resource and its dependencies. This flag can be used
                         multiple times.

  -var 'foo=bar'         Set a variable in the Terraform configuration. This
                         flag can be set multiple times.

  -var-file=foo          Set variables in the Terraform configuration from
                         a file. If "terraform.tfvars" or any ".auto.tfvars"
                         files are present, they will be automatically loaded.
