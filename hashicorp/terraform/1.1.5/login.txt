Usage: terraform [global options] login [hostname]

  Retrieves an authentication token for the given hostname, if it supports
  automatic login, and saves it in a credentials file in your home directory.

  If no hostname is provided, the default hostname is app.terraform.io, to
  log in to Terraform Cloud.

  If not overridden by credentials helper settings in the CLI configuration,
  the credentials will be written to the following local file:
      /Users/rbradfor/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json
