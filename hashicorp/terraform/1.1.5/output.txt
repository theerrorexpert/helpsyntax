Usage: terraform [global options] output [options] [NAME]

  Reads an output variable from a Terraform state file and prints
  the value. With no additional arguments, output will display all
  the outputs for the root module.  If NAME is not specified, all
  outputs are printed.

Options:

  -state=path      Path to the state file to read. Defaults to
                   "terraform.tfstate".

  -no-color        If specified, output won't contain any color.

  -json            If specified, machine readable output will be
                   printed in JSON format.

  -raw             For value types that can be automatically
                   converted to a string, will print the raw
                   string directly, rather than a human-oriented
                   representation of the value.
