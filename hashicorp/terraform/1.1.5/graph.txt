Usage: terraform [global options] graph [options]

  Produces a representation of the dependency graph between different
  objects in the current configuration and state.

  The graph is presented in the DOT language. The typical program that can
  read this format is GraphViz, but many web services are also available
  to read this format.

Options:

  -plan=tfplan     Render graph using the specified plan file instead of the
                   configuration in the current directory.

  -draw-cycles     Highlight any cycles in the graph with colored edges.
                   This helps when diagnosing cycle errors.

  -type=plan       Type of graph to output. Can be: plan, plan-refresh-only,
                   plan-destroy, or apply. By default Terraform chooses
				   "plan", or "apply" if you also set the -plan=... option.

  -module-depth=n  (deprecated) In prior versions of Terraform, specified the
				   depth of modules to show in the output.
