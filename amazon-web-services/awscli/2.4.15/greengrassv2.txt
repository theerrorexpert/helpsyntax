GREENGRASSV2()                                                  GREENGRASSV2()



NAME
       greengrassv2 -

DESCRIPTION
       IoT  Greengrass brings local compute, messaging, data management, sync,
       and ML inference capabilities to edge devices. This enables devices  to
       collect  and  analyze  data  closer to the source of information, react
       autonomously to local events, and communicate securely with each  other
       on  local  networks.  Local  devices can also communicate securely with
       Amazon Web Services IoT Core and export IoT data to the Amazon Web Ser-
       vices  Cloud.  IoT  Greengrass  developers can use Lambda functions and
       components to create and deploy applications to fleets of edge  devices
       for local operation.

       IoT Greengrass Version 2 provides a new major version of the IoT Green-
       grass Core software, new APIs, and a new console. Use this  API  refer-
       ence to learn how to use the IoT Greengrass V2 API operations to manage
       components, manage deployments, and core devices.

       V2 Developer Guide .
