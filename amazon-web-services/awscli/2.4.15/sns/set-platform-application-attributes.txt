SYNOPSIS
            set-platform-application-attributes
          --platform-application-arn <value>
          --attributes <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --platform-application-arn (string)
          PlatformApplicationArn for SetPlatformApplicationAttributes  action.

       --attributes (map)
          A map of the platform application attributes. Attributes in this map
          include the following:

          o PlatformCredential  The credential received from the  notification
            service.

            o For ADM, PlatformCredential is client secret.

            o For  Apple  Services using certificate credentials, PlatformCre-
              dential is private key.

            o For Apple Services using token  credentials,  PlatformCredential
              is signing key.

            o For  GCM  (Firebase  Cloud Messaging), PlatformCredential is API
              key.

          o PlatformPrincipal  The principal received  from  the  notification
            service.

            o For ADM, PlatformPrincipal is client id.

            o For  Apple Services using certificate credentials, PlatformPrin-
              cipal is SSL certificate.

            o For Apple Services using token credentials, PlatformPrincipal is
              signing key ID.

            o For  GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging), there is no PlatformPrinci-
              pal .

          o EventEndpointCreated  Topic ARN  to  which  EndpointCreated  event
            notifications are sent.

          o EventEndpointDeleted   Topic  ARN  to  which EndpointDeleted event
            notifications are sent.

          o EventEndpointUpdated  Topic  ARN  to  which  EndpointUpdate  event
            notifications are sent.

          o EventDeliveryFailure   Topic  ARN  to  which DeliveryFailure event
            notifications are sent upon Direct Publish delivery failure  (per-
            manent) to one of the application's endpoints.

          o SuccessFeedbackRoleArn  IAM role ARN used to give Amazon SNS write
            access to use CloudWatch Logs on your behalf.

          o FailureFeedbackRoleArn  IAM role ARN used to give Amazon SNS write
            access to use CloudWatch Logs on your behalf.

          o SuccessFeedbackSampleRate   Sample rate percentage (0-100) of suc-
            cessfully delivered messages.

          The following attributes only apply to APNs token-based  authentica-
          tion:

          o ApplePlatformTeamID   The identifier that's assigned to your Apple
            developer account team.

          o ApplePlatformBundleID  The bundle identifier  that's  assigned  to
            your iOS app.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To set platform application attributes

       The  following  set-platform-application-attributes  example  sets  the
       EventDeliveryFailure attribute for the specified  platform  application
       to the ARN of the specified Amazon SNS topic.

          aws sns set-platform-application-attributes \
              --platform-application-arn arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:app/GCM/MyApplication \
              --attributes EventDeliveryFailure=arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:AnotherTopic

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       None
