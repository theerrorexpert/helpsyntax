CREATE-PLATFORM-ENDPOINT()                          CREATE-PLATFORM-ENDPOINT()



NAME
       create-platform-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an endpoint for a device and mobile app on one of the supported
       push notification services, such as GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging)  and
       APNS.  CreatePlatformEndpoint  requires the PlatformApplicationArn that
       is returned from CreatePlatformApplication . You can use  the  returned
       EndpointArn  to  send  a  message  to  a mobile app or by the Subscribe
       action for subscription to a topic. The  CreatePlatformEndpoint  action
       is  idempotent,  so  if the requester already owns an endpoint with the
       same device token and attributes, that endpoint's ARN is returned with-
       out creating a new endpoint. For more information, see Using Amazon SNS
       Mobile Push Notifications .

       When using CreatePlatformEndpoint with Baidu, two  attributes  must  be
       provided:  ChannelId  and UserId. The token field must also contain the
       ChannelId. For more information, see Creating an  Amazon  SNS  Endpoint
       for Baidu .

SYNOPSIS
            create-platform-endpoint
          --platform-application-arn <value>
          --token <value>
          [--custom-user-data <value>]
          [--attributes <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --platform-application-arn (string)
          PlatformApplicationArn  returned  from  CreatePlatformApplication is
          used to create a an endpoint.

       --token (string)
          Unique identifier created by the notification service for an app  on
          a  device. The specific name for Token will vary, depending on which
          notification service is being used. For example, when using APNS  as
          the  notification service, you need the device token. Alternatively,
          when using GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) or ADM, the  device  token
          equivalent is called the registration ID.

       --custom-user-data (string)
          Arbitrary  user data to associate with the endpoint. Amazon SNS does
          not use this data. The data must be in UTF-8 format  and  less  than
          2KB.

       --attributes (map)
          For a list of attributes, see SetEndpointAttributes .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a platform application endpoint

       The  following create-platform-endpoint example creates an endpoint for
       the specified platform application using the specified token.

          aws sns create-platform-endpoint \
              --platform-application-arn arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:app/GCM/MyApplication \
              --token EXAMPLE12345...

       Output:

          {
                "EndpointArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:1234567890:endpoint/GCM/MyApplication/12345678-abcd-9012-efgh-345678901234"
          }

OUTPUT
       EndpointArn -> (string)
          EndpointArn returned from CreateEndpoint action.
