SYNOPSIS
            set-sms-attributes
          --attributes <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --attributes (map)
          The  default  settings for sending SMS messages from your Amazon Web
          Services account. You can set values  for  the  following  attribute
          names:
              MonthlySpendLimit   The maximum amount in USD that you are will-
              ing to spend each month to send SMS messages.  When  Amazon  SNS
              determines  that  sending an SMS message would incur a cost that
              exceeds this limit, it stops sending SMS  messages  within  min-
              utes.

          WARNING:
              Amazon  SNS  stops  sending  SMS  messages within minutes of the
              limit being crossed. During that interval, if  you  continue  to
              send  SMS messages, you will incur costs that exceed your limit.

          By default, the spend limit is set to the maximum allowed by  Amazon
          SNS.  If  you  want to raise the limit, submit an SNS Limit Increase
          case . For New limit value , enter your desired monthly spend limit.
          In  the  Use Case Description field, explain that you are requesting
          an SMS monthly spend limit increase.
              DeliveryStatusIAMRole  The ARN of the IAM role that allows  Ama-
              zon  SNS  to write logs about SMS deliveries in CloudWatch Logs.
              For each SMS message that you send, Amazon SNS writes a log that
              includes  the  message price, the success or failure status, the
              reason for failure (if the message failed),  the  message  dwell
              time, and other information.

              DeliveryStatusSuccessSamplingRate   The percentage of successful
              SMS deliveries for which Amazon SNS will write  logs  in  Cloud-
              Watch  Logs. The value can be an integer from 0 - 100. For exam-
              ple, to write logs only for failed deliveries, set this value to
              0  . To write logs for 10% of your successful deliveries, set it
              to 10 .

              DefaultSenderID  A string, such as your business brand, that  is
              displayed  as  the  sender  on the receiving device. Support for
              sender IDs varies by country. The  sender  ID  can  be  1  -  11
              alphanumeric  characters,  and it must contain at least one let-
              ter.

              DefaultSMSType  The type of SMS message that you  will  send  by
              default. You can assign the following values:

          o Promotional   (Default)  Noncritical  messages,  such as marketing
            messages. Amazon SNS optimizes the message delivery to  incur  the
            lowest cost.

          o Transactional   Critical  messages  that support customer transac-
            tions, such as one-time passcodes for multi-factor authentication.
            Amazon  SNS  optimizes the message delivery to achieve the highest
            reliability.
              UsageReportS3Bucket  The name of the Amazon S3 bucket to receive
              daily  SMS  usage  reports from Amazon SNS. Each day, Amazon SNS
              will deliver a usage report as a CSV file  to  the  bucket.  The
              report  includes  the following information for each SMS message
              that was successfully delivered  by  your  Amazon  Web  Services
              account:

          o Time that the message was published (in UTC)

          o Message ID

          o Destination phone number

          o Message type

          o Delivery status

          o Message price (in USD)

          o Part  number  (a message is split into multiple parts if it is too
            long for a single message)

          o Total number of parts

          To receive the report, the bucket must have a policy that allows the
          Amazon SNS service principal to perform the s3:PutObject and s3:Get-
          BucketLocation actions.

          For an example bucket policy and usage report,  see  Monitoring  SMS
          Activity in the Amazon SNS Developer Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To set SMS message attributes

       The following set-sms-attributes example sets the default sender ID for
       SMS messages to MyName.

          aws sns set-sms-attributes \
              --attributes DefaultSenderID=MyName

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       None
