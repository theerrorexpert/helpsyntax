LIST-PHONE-NUMBERS-OPTED-OUT()                  LIST-PHONE-NUMBERS-OPTED-OUT()



NAME
       list-phone-numbers-opted-out -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list of phone numbers that are opted out, meaning you cannot
       send SMS messages to them.

       The results for ListPhoneNumbersOptedOut are paginated, and  each  page
       returns up to 100 phone numbers. If additional phone numbers are avail-
       able after the first page of results, then a NextToken string  will  be
       returned.  To  receive the next page, you call ListPhoneNumbersOptedOut
       again using the NextToken string received from the previous call.  When
       there are no more records to return, NextToken will be null.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-phone-numbers-opted-out  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: phoneNumbers

SYNOPSIS
            list-phone-numbers-opted-out
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
