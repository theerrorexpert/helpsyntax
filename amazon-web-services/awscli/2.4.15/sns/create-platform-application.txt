CREATE-PLATFORM-APPLICATION()                    CREATE-PLATFORM-APPLICATION()



NAME
       create-platform-application -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  platform  application  object for one of the supported push
       notification services, such as APNS and GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging),
       to  which  devices and mobile apps may register. You must specify Plat-
       formPrincipal and PlatformCredential attributes  when  using  the  Cre-
       atePlatformApplication action.
          PlatformPrincipal and PlatformCredential are received from the noti-
          fication service.

       o For ADM , PlatformPrincipal is client id  and  PlatformCredential  is
         client secret .

       o For  Baidu  ,  PlatformPrincipal is API key and PlatformCredential is
         secret key .

       o For APNS and APNS_SANDBOX using  certificate  credentials,  Platform-
         Principal  is SSL certificate and PlatformCredential is private key .

       o For APNS and APNS_SANDBOX using token credentials,  PlatformPrincipal
         is signing key ID and PlatformCredential is signing key .

       o For GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging), there is no PlatformPrincipal and
         the PlatformCredential is API key .

       o For MPNS , PlatformPrincipal is TLS certificate  and  PlatformCreden-
         tial is private key .

       o For  WNS , PlatformPrincipal is Package Security Identifier and Plat-
         formCredential is secret key .

       You can use the returned PlatformApplicationArn as an attribute for the
       CreatePlatformEndpoint action.

SYNOPSIS
            create-platform-application
          --name <value>
          --platform <value>
          --attributes <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          Application  names  must  be made up of only uppercase and lowercase
          ASCII letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens, and periods, and  must
          be between 1 and 256 characters long.

       --platform (string)
          The  following  platforms  are supported: ADM (Amazon Device Messag-
          ing), APNS (Apple Push Notification Service), APNS_SANDBOX, and  GCM
          (Firebase Cloud Messaging).

       --attributes (map)
          For a list of attributes, see SetPlatformApplicationAttributes .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a platform application

       The  following  create-platform-application  example  creates  a Google
       Firebase platform application using the specified platform  credential.

          aws sns create-platform-application \
              --name MyApplication \
              --platform GCM \
              --attributes PlatformCredential=EXAMPLEabcd12345jklm67890stuv12345bcdef

       Output:

          {
              "PlatformApplicationArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:app/GCM/MyApplication"
          }

OUTPUT
       PlatformApplicationArn -> (string)
          PlatformApplicationArn is returned.
