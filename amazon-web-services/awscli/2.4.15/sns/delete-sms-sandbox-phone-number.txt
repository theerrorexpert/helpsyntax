NAME
       delete-sms-sandbox-phone-number -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes an Amazon Web Services account's verified or pending phone num-
       ber from the SMS sandbox.

       When you start using Amazon SNS to send SMS messages, your  Amazon  Web
       Services  account  is  in  the SMS sandbox . The SMS sandbox provides a
       safe environment for you to try Amazon  SNS  features  without  risking
       your  reputation  as  an  SMS  sender.  While  your Amazon Web Services
       account is in the SMS sandbox, you can use all of the features of  Ama-
       zon  SNS.  However, you can send SMS messages only to verified destina-
       tion phone numbers. For more information, including how to move out  of
       the  sandbox  to send messages without restrictions, see SMS sandbox in
       the Amazon SNS Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            delete-sms-sandbox-phone-number
          --phone-number <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --phone-number (string)
          The destination phone number to delete.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
