LIST-TOPICS()                                                    LIST-TOPICS()



NAME
       list-topics -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of the requester's topics. Each call returns a limited
       list of topics, up to 100. If there are more  topics,  a  NextToken  is
       also  returned. Use the NextToken parameter in a new ListTopics call to
       get further results.

       This action is throttled at 30 transactions per second (TPS).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-topics is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be  issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the  results  of  the  following  query
       expressions: Topics

SYNOPSIS
            list-topics
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list your SNS topics

       The  following  list-topics example lists all of SNS topics in your AWS
       account.

          aws sns list-topics

       Output:

          {
              "Topics": [
                  {
                      "TopicArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:my-topic"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Topics -> (list)
          A list of topic ARNs.

          (structure)
              A wrapper type for the topic's Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN).  To
              retrieve a topic's attributes, use GetTopicAttributes .

              TopicArn -> (string)
                 The topic's ARN.

       NextToken -> (string)
          Token  to pass along to the next ListTopics request. This element is
          returned if there are additional topics to retrieve.
