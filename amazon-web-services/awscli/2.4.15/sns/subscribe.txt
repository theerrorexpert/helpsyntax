SUBSCRIBE()                                                        SUBSCRIBE()



NAME
       subscribe -

DESCRIPTION
       Subscribes  an endpoint to an Amazon SNS topic. If the endpoint type is
       HTTP/S or email, or if the endpoint and the topic are not in  the  same
       Amazon  Web  Services account, the endpoint owner must run the Confirm-
       Subscription action to confirm the subscription.

       You call the ConfirmSubscription action with the token  from  the  sub-
       scription response. Confirmation tokens are valid for three days.

       This action is throttled at 100 transactions per second (TPS).

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            subscribe
          --topic-arn <value>
          --protocol <value>
          [--attributes <value>]
          [--return-subscription-arn | --no-return-subscription-arn]
          [--notification-endpoint <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --topic-arn (string)
          The ARN of the topic you want to subscribe to.

       --protocol (string)
          The protocol that you want to use. Supported protocols include:

          o http  delivery of JSON-encoded message via HTTP POST

          o https  delivery of JSON-encoded message via HTTPS POST

          o email  delivery of message via SMTP

          o email-json  delivery of JSON-encoded message via SMTP

          o sms  delivery of message via SMS

          o sqs  delivery of JSON-encoded message to an Amazon SQS queue

          o application   delivery  of  JSON-encoded message to an EndpointArn
            for a mobile app and device

          o lambda  delivery of JSON-encoded message to an Lambda function

          o firehose  delivery of JSON-encoded message to  an  Amazon  Kinesis
            Data Firehose delivery stream.

       --attributes (map)
          A map of attributes with their corresponding values.

          The  following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the spe-
          cial request parameters that the Subscribe action uses:

          o DeliveryPolicy  The policy that defines  how  Amazon  SNS  retries
            failed deliveries to HTTP/S endpoints.

          o FilterPolicy   The  simple  JSON  object that lets your subscriber
            receive only a subset of messages,  rather  than  receiving  every
            message published to the topic.

          o RawMessageDelivery   When set to true , enables raw message deliv-
            ery to Amazon SQS or HTTP/S endpoints. This  eliminates  the  need
            for  the  endpoints to process JSON formatting, which is otherwise
            created for Amazon SNS metadata.

          o RedrivePolicy  When specified, sends undeliverable messages to the
            specified  Amazon  SQS  dead-letter  queue. Messages that can't be
            delivered due to client errors (for example, when  the  subscribed
            endpoint  is  unreachable) or server errors (for example, when the
            service that powers the subscribed endpoint  becomes  unavailable)
            are  held  in the dead-letter queue for further analysis or repro-
            cessing.

          The following attribute applies only to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose
          delivery stream subscriptions:

          o SubscriptionRoleArn   The ARN of the IAM role that has the follow-
            ing:

            o Permission to write to the Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream

            o Amazon SNS listed as a trusted entity

          Specifying  a  valid  ARN for this attribute is required for Kinesis
          Data Firehose delivery stream subscriptions. For  more  information,
          see  Fanout  to Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams in the Amazon
          SNS Developer Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --return-subscription-arn | --no-return-subscription-arn (boolean)
          Sets whether the response from the Subscribe  request  includes  the
          subscription ARN, even if the subscription is not yet confirmed.

          If you set this parameter to true , the response includes the ARN in
          all cases, even if the subscription is not yet confirmed.  In  addi-
          tion  to  the  ARN  for  confirmed  subscriptions, the response also
          includes the pending subscription ARN value for  subscriptions  that
          aren't yet confirmed. A subscription becomes confirmed when the sub-
          scriber calls the ConfirmSubscription  action  with  a  confirmation
          token.

          The default value is false .

       --notification-endpoint (string)
          The  endpoint that you want to receive notifications. Endpoints vary
          by protocol:

          o For the http protocol, the (public) endpoint is  a  URL  beginning
            with http:// .

          o For  the  https protocol, the (public) endpoint is a URL beginning
            with https:// .

          o For the email protocol, the endpoint is an email address.

          o For the email-json protocol, the endpoint is an email address.

          o For the sms protocol,  the  endpoint  is  a  phone  number  of  an
            SMS-enabled device.

          o For  the  sqs  protocol,  the endpoint is the ARN of an Amazon SQS
            queue.

          o For the application protocol, the endpoint is the EndpointArn of a
            mobile app and device.

          o For  the  lambda  protocol,  the  endpoint is the ARN of an Lambda
            function.

          o For the firehose protocol, the endpoint is the ARN  of  an  Amazon
            Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To subscribe to a topic

       The  following  subscribe  command  subscribes  an email address to the
       specified topic.

          aws sns subscribe \
              --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:my-topic \
              --protocol email \
              --notification-endpoint my-email@example.com

       Output:

          {
              "SubscriptionArn": "pending confirmation"
          }

OUTPUT
       SubscriptionArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the subscription if it is confirmed, or the string "pend-
          ing  confirmation"  if  the subscription requires confirmation. How-
          ever, if the API request parameter  ReturnSubscriptionArn  is  true,
          then the value is always the subscription ARN, even if the subscrip-
          tion requires confirmation.
