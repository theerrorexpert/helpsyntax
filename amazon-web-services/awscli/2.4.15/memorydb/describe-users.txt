       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-users
          [--user-name <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-name (string)
          The name of the user

       --filters (list)
          Filter to determine the list of users to return.

          (structure)
              Used  to  streamline  results  of a search based on the property
              being filtered.

              Name -> (string)
                 The property being filtered. For example, UserName.

              Values -> (list)
                 The property values to filter on. For example, "user-123".

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of records to include in the  response.  If  more
          records  exist  than  the  specified  MaxResults  value,  a token is
          included in the response  so  that  the  remaining  results  can  be
          retrieved.

       --next-token (string)
          An  optional  argument  to  pass in case the total number of records
          exceeds the value of MaxResults. If nextToken is returned, there are
          more  results  available. The value of nextToken is a unique pagina-
          tion token for each page. Make the call  again  using  the  returned
          token to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Users -> (list)
          A list of users.

          (structure)
              You create users and assign them specific permissions  by  using
              an  access  string. You assign the users to Access Control Lists
              aligned with a specific role (administrators,  human  resources)
              that are then deployed to one or more MemoryDB clusters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the user

              Status -> (string)
                 Indicates  the  user  status. Can be "active", "modifying" or
                 "deleting".

              AccessString -> (string)
                 Access permissions string used for this user.

              ACLNames -> (list)
                 The names of the Access  Control  Lists  to  which  the  user
                 belongs

                 (string)

              MinimumEngineVersion -> (string)
                 The minimum engine version supported for the user

              Authentication -> (structure)
                 Denotes whether the user requires a password to authenticate.

                 Type -> (string)
                     Indicates whether the user requires a password to authen-
                     ticate.

                 PasswordCount -> (integer)
                     The  number of passwords belonging to the user. The maxi-
                     mum is two.

              ARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the user.

       NextToken -> (string)
          An optional argument to pass in case the  total  number  of  records
          exceeds the value of MaxResults. If nextToken is returned, there are
          more results available. The value of nextToken is a  unique  pagina-
          tion  token  for  each  page. Make the call again using the returned
          token to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged.
