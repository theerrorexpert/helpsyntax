DESCRIBE-ACLS()                                                DESCRIBE-ACLS()



NAME
       describe-acls -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of ACLs

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-acls
          [--acl-name <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --acl-name (string)
          The name of the ACL

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of records to include in the response. If more
          records exist than  the  specified  MaxResults  value,  a  token  is
          included  in  the  response  so  that  the  remaining results can be
          retrieved.

       --next-token (string)
          An optional argument to pass in case the  total  number  of  records
          exceeds the value of MaxResults. If nextToken is returned, there are
          more results available. The value of nextToken is a  unique  pagina-
          tion  token  for  each  page. Make the call again using the returned
          token to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ACLs -> (list)
          The list of ACLs

          (structure)
              An  Access  Control List. You can authenticate users with Access
              Contol Lists. ACLs enable  you  to  control  cluster  access  by
              grouping users. These Access control lists are designed as a way
              to organize access to clusters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the Access Control List

              Status -> (string)
                 Indicates ACL status. Can be "creating",  "active",  "modify-
                 ing", "deleting".

              UserNames -> (list)
                 The list of user names that belong to the ACL.

                 (string)

              MinimumEngineVersion -> (string)
                 The minimum engine version supported for the ACL

              PendingChanges -> (structure)
                 A list of updates being applied to the ACL.

                 UserNamesToRemove -> (list)
                     A list of user names being removed from the ACL

                     (string)

                 UserNamesToAdd -> (list)
                     A list of users being added to the ACL

                     (string)

              Clusters -> (list)
                 A list of clusters associated with the ACL.

                 (string)

              ARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the ACL

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  nextToken  is  returned,  there  are more results available. The
          value of nextToken is a unique pagination token for each page.  Make
          the  call  again using the returned token to retrieve the next page.
          Keep all other arguments unchanged.
