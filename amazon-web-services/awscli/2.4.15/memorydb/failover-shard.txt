FAILOVER-SHARD()                                              FAILOVER-SHARD()



NAME
       failover-shard -

DESCRIPTION
       Used to failover a shard

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            failover-shard
          --cluster-name <value>
          --shard-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The cluster being failed over

       --shard-name (string)
          The name of the shard

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              window is a 60 minute period.

              The  daily time range (in UTC) during which MemoryDB begins tak-
              ing a daily snapshot of your shard. Example: 05:00-09:00 If  you
              do not specify this parameter, MemoryDB automatically chooses an
              appropriate time range.

          ACLName -> (string)
