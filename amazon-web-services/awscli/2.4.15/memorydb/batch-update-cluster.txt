NAME
       batch-update-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Apply  the  service  update  to  a  list of clusters supplied. For more
       information on service updates and applying them, see Applying the ser-
       vice updates .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-update-cluster
          --cluster-names <value>
          [--service-update <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-names (list)
          The cluster names to apply the updates.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --service-update (structure)
          The unique ID of the service update

          ServiceUpdateNameToApply -> (string)
              The unique ID of the service update

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ServiceUpdateNameToApply=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ServiceUpdateNameToApply": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
