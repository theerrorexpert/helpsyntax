DESCRIBE-EVENTS()                                            DESCRIBE-EVENTS()



NAME
       describe-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  events  related  to  clusters,  security groups, and parameter
       groups. You can obtain events specific to a particular  cluster,  secu-
       rity group, or parameter group by providing the name as a parameter. By
       default, only the events occurring within the last hour  are  returned;
       however,  you can retrieve up to 14 days' worth of events if necessary.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-events
          [--source-name <value>]
          [--source-type <value>]
          [--start-time <value>]
          [--end-time <value>]
          [--duration <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-name (string)
          The identifier of the event source for which events are returned. If
          not specified, all sources are included in the response.

       --source-type (string)
          The  event  source to retrieve events for. If no value is specified,
          all events are returned.

          Possible values:

          o node

          o parameter-group

          o subnet-group

          o cluster

          o user

          o acl

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The beginning of the time interval to retrieve events for, specified
          in ISO 8601 format. Example: 2017-03-30T07:03:49.555Z

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end of the time interval for which to retrieve events, specified
          in ISO 8601 format. Example: 2017-03-30T07:03:49.555Z

       --duration (integer)
          The number of minutes worth of events to retrieve.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of records to include in the  response.  If  more
          records  exist  than  the  specified  MaxResults  value,  a token is
          included in the response  so  that  the  remaining  results  can  be
          retrieved.

       --next-token (string)
          An  optional  argument  to  pass in case the total number of records
          exceeds the value of MaxResults. If nextToken is returned, there are
          more  results  available. The value of nextToken is a unique pagina-
          tion token for each page. Make the call  again  using  the  returned
          token to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          An optional argument to pass in case the  total  number  of  records
          exceeds the value of MaxResults. If nextToken is returned, there are
          more results available. The value of nextToken is a  unique  pagina-
          tion  token  for  each  page. Make the call again using the returned
          token to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

       Events -> (list)
          A  list of events. Each element in the list contains detailed infor-
          mation about one event.

          (structure)
              Represents a single occurrence of something  interesting  within
              the  system.  Some  examples of events are creating a cluster or
              adding or removing a node.

              SourceName -> (string)
                 The name for the source of the event.  For  example,  if  the
                 event  occurred at the cluster level, the identifier would be
                 the name of the cluster.

              SourceType -> (string)
                 Specifies the origin of this event - a cluster,  a  parameter
                 group, a security group, etc.

              Message -> (string)
                 The text of the event.

              Date -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the event occurred.
