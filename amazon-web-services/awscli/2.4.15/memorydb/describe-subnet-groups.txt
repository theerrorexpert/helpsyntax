DESCRIBE-SUBNET-GROUPS()                              DESCRIBE-SUBNET-GROUPS()



NAME
       describe-subnet-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list of subnet group descriptions. If a subnet group name is
       specified, the list contains only the description of that group.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-subnet-groups
          [--subnet-group-name <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subnet-group-name (string)
          The name of the subnet group to return details for.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of records to include in the  response.  If  more
          records  exist  than  the  specified  MaxResults  value,  a token is
          included in the response  so  that  the  remaining  results  can  be
          retrieved.

       --next-token (string)
          An  optional  argument  to  pass in case the total number of records
          exceeds the value of MaxResults. If nextToken is returned, there are
          more  results  available. The value of nextToken is a unique pagina-
          tion token for each page. Make the call  again  using  the  returned
          token to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          An optional argument to pass in case the  total  number  of  records
          exceeds the value of MaxResults. If nextToken is returned, there are
          more results available. The value of nextToken is a  unique  pagina-
          tion  token  for  each  page. Make the call again using the returned
          token to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

       SubnetGroups -> (list)
          A  list of subnet groups. Each element in the list contains detailed
          information about one group.

          (structure)
              Represents the output of one of the following operations:

              o CreateSubnetGroup

              o UpdateSubnetGroup

              A subnet group is a collection of  subnets  (typically  private)
              that  you  can  designate for your clusters running in an Amazon
              Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the subnet group

              Description -> (string)
                 A description of the subnet group

              VpcId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Virtual Private Cloud identifier (VPC ID)  of  the
                 subnet group.

              Subnets -> (list)
                 A list of subnets associated with the subnet group.

                 (structure)
                     Represents  the  subnet  associated  with a cluster. This
                     parameter refers to subnets  defined  in  Amazon  Virtual
                     Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) and used with MemoryDB.

                     Identifier -> (string)
                        The unique identifier for the subnet.

                     AvailabilityZone -> (structure)
                        The Availability Zone where the subnet resides

                        Name -> (string)
                            The name of the Availability Zone.

              ARN -> (string)
                 The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the subnet group.
