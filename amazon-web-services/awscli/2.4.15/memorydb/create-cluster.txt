          being deleted.

       --tags (list)
          A  list  of  tags to be added to this resource. Tags are comma-sepa-
          rated key,value pairs (e.g.  Key=myKey,  Value=myKeyValue.  You  can

          Value Key=mySecondKey, Value=mySecondKeyValue.

          (structure)
              A tag that can be added to an MemoryDB resource. Tags  are  com-
              posed  of  a  Key/Value pair. You can use tags to categorize and
              track all your MemoryDB resources. When you add or  remove  tags
              on  clusters,  those  actions will be replicated to all nodes in
              the cluster. A tag with a null  Value  is  permitted.  For  more
              information, see Tagging your MemoryDB resources

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for the tag. May not be null.

            ...
          ]

       --snapshot-window (string)
          The  daily time range (in UTC) during which MemoryDB begins taking a
          daily snapshot of your shard.

          Example: 05:00-09:00

          If you do not specify this parameter, MemoryDB automatically chooses
          an appropriate time range.

       --acl-name (string)
          The name of the Access Control List to associate with the cluster.

       --engine-version (string)
          The version number of the Redis engine to be used for the cluster.

       --auto-minor-version-upgrade      |     --no-auto-minor-version-upgrade
       (boolean)
          When set to true,  the  cluster  will  automatically  receive  minor
          engine version upgrades after launch.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.
