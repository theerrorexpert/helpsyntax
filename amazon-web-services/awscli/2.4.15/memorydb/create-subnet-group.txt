CREATE-SUBNET-GROUP()                                    CREATE-SUBNET-GROUP()



NAME
       create-subnet-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a subnet group. A subnet group is a collection of subnets (typ-
       ically private) that you can designate for your clusters running in  an
       Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment. When you create a clus-
       ter in an Amazon VPC, you must specify a subnet  group.  MemoryDB  uses
       that  subnet group to choose a subnet and IP addresses within that sub-
       net to associate with your nodes. For more information, see Subnets and
       subnet groups .

SYNOPSIS
            create-subnet-group
          --subnet-group-name <value>
          [--description <value>]
          --subnet-ids <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subnet-group-name (string)
          The name of the subnet group.

       --description (string)
          A description for the subnet group.

       --subnet-ids (list)
          A list of VPC subnet IDs for the subnet group.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          A  list  of  tags to be added to this resource. A tag is a key-value
          pair. A tag key must be accompanied by a tag value, although null is
          accepted.

          (structure)
              A  tag  that can be added to an MemoryDB resource. Tags are com-
              posed of a Key/Value pair. You can use tags  to  categorize  and
              track  all  your MemoryDB resources. When you add or remove tags
              on clusters, those actions will be replicated to  all  nodes  in
              the  cluster.  A  tag  with  a null Value is permitted. For more
              information, see Tagging your MemoryDB resources

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for the tag. May not be null.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag's value. May be null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SubnetGroup -> (structure)
          The newly-created subnet group

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the subnet group

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the subnet group

          VpcId -> (string)
              The Amazon Virtual Private Cloud identifier (VPC ID) of the sub-
              net group.

          Subnets -> (list)
              A list of subnets associated with the subnet group.

              (structure)
                 Represents the subnet associated with a cluster. This parame-
                 ter refers to subnets defined in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud
                 (Amazon VPC) and used with MemoryDB.

                 Identifier -> (string)
                     The unique identifier for the subnet.

                 AvailabilityZone -> (structure)
                     The Availability Zone where the subnet resides

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the Availability Zone.

          ARN -> (string)
              The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the subnet group.
