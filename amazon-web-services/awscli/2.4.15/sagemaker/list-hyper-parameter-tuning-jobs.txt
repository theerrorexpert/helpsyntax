NAME
       list-hyper-parameter-tuning-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a  list  of  HyperParameterTuningJobSummary objects that describe
       the hyperparameter tuning jobs launched in your account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-hyper-parameter-tuning-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: HyperParameterTuningJobSummaries

OPTIONS
       --sort-by (string)
          The field to sort results by. The default is Name .

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o Status

          o CreationTime

          The sort order for results. The default is Ascending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --name-contains (string)
          A  string  in  the  tuning job name. This filter returns only tuning
          jobs whose name contains the specified string.

       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only tuning jobs that were created  after  the
          specified time.

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A  filter that returns only tuning jobs that were created before the
          specified time.

       --last-modified-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only tuning jobs that were modified after  the
          specified time.

       --last-modified-time-before (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only tuning jobs that were modified before the
          specified time.

       --status-equals (string)
          A filter that returns only tuning jobs with the specified status.

          Possible values:

          o Completed

          o InProgress

          o Failed

          o Stopped

          o Stopping

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          tuning jobs that the ListHyperParameterTuningJobs request  returned.

          (structure)
              Provides  summary information about a hyperparameter tuning job.

              HyperParameterTuningJobName -> (string)

                 The status of the tuning job.

              Strategy -> (string)
                 Specifies the search strategy hyperparameter tuning  uses  to
                 choose  which hyperparameters to use for each iteration. Cur-
                 rently, the only valid value is Bayesian.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)

                 bers  of training jobs, categorized by status, that this tun-
                 ing job launched.

                 Completed -> (integer)
                     The number of completed training  jobs  launched  by  the
                     hyperparameter tuning job.

                     The number of training  jobs  that  failed,  but  can  be
                     retried.  A failed training job can be retried only if it
                     failed because an internal service error occurred.

                 NonRetryableError -> (integer)
                     The number of training jobs  that  failed  and  can't  be

                 bers of training jobs, categorized by objective  metric  sta-
                 tus, that this tuning job launched.

                 Succeeded -> (integer)
                     The  number of training jobs whose final objective metric
                     was evaluated by the hyperparameter tuning job  and  used
                     in the hyperparameter tuning process.

                 Pending -> (integer)
                     The  number  of  training  jobs  that are in progress and
                     pending evaluation of their final objective metric.

                 Failed -> (integer)
                     The number of training jobs whose final objective  metric
                     was  not  evaluated and used in the hyperparameter tuning
                     process. This typically  occurs  when  the  training  job
                     failed or did not emit an objective metric.

              ResourceLimits -> (structure)
                 The   ResourceLimits object that specifies the maximum number
                 of training jobs and parallel training jobs allowed for  this
                 tuning job.

                 MaxNumberOfTrainingJobs -> (integer)
                     The maximum number of training jobs that a hyperparameter
                     tuning job can launch.

                 MaxParallelTrainingJobs -> (integer)
                     The maximum number of concurrent  training  jobs  that  a
                     hyperparameter tuning job can launch.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the result of this ListHyperParameterTuningJobs request was trun-
          cated, the response includes a NextToken . To retrieve the next  set
          of tuning jobs, use the token in the next request.
