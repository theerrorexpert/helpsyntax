STOP-NOTEBOOK-INSTANCE()                              STOP-NOTEBOOK-INSTANCE()



NAME
       stop-notebook-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Terminates  the  ML  compute instance. Before terminating the instance,
       Amazon SageMaker disconnects the ML  storage  volume  from  it.  Amazon
       SageMaker  preserves  the  ML  storage  volume.  Amazon SageMaker stops
       charging you for the ML compute instance when you call  StopNotebookIn-
       stance .

       To  access  data  on the ML storage volume for a notebook instance that
       has been terminated, call  the  StartNotebookInstance  API.  StartNote-
       bookInstance  launches  another ML compute instance, configures it, and
       attaches the preserved ML storage volume so you can continue your work.

SYNOPSIS
            stop-notebook-instance
          --notebook-instance-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --notebook-instance-name (string)
          The name of the notebook instance to terminate.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
