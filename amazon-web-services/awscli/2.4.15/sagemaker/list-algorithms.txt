LIST-ALGORITHMS()                                            LIST-ALGORITHMS()



NAME
       list-algorithms -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the machine learning algorithms that have been created.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-algorithms  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: AlgorithmSummaryList

SYNOPSIS
            list-algorithms
          [--creation-time-after <value>]
          [--creation-time-before <value>]
          [--name-contains <value>]
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only algorithms created  after  the  specified
          time (timestamp).

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A  filter  that returns only algorithms created before the specified
          time (timestamp).

       --name-contains (string)
          A string in the algorithm name. This filter returns only  algorithms
          whose name contains the specified string.

       --sort-by (string)
          The parameter by which to sort the results. The default is Creation-
          Time .

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreationTime

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for the results. The default is Ascending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AlgorithmSummaryList -> (list)
          >An  array of AlgorithmSummary objects, each of which lists an algo-
          rithm.

          (structure)
              Provides summary information about an algorithm.

              AlgorithmName -> (string)
                 The name of the algorithm that is described by the summary.

              AlgorithmArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the algorithm.

              AlgorithmDescription -> (string)
                 A brief description of the algorithm.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp that shows when the algorithm was created.

              AlgorithmStatus -> (string)
                 The overall status of the algorithm.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response is truncated, Amazon SageMaker returns  this  token.
          To  retrieve  the  next  set of algorithms, use it in the subsequent
          request.
