DELETE-DOMAIN()                                                DELETE-DOMAIN()



NAME
       delete-domain -

DESCRIPTION
       Used  to delete a domain. If you onboarded with IAM mode, you will need
       to delete your domain to onboard again using SSO. Use with caution. All
       of  the  members  of  the  domain will lose access to their EFS volume,
       including data, notebooks, and other artifacts.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-domain
          --domain-id <value>
          [--retention-policy <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-id (string)
          The domain ID.

       --retention-policy (structure)
          The retention  policy  for  this  domain,  which  specifies  whether
          resources  will be retained after the Domain is deleted. By default,
          all resources are retained (not automatically deleted).

          HomeEfsFileSystem -> (string)
              The default is Retain , which specifies to keep the data  stored
              on the EFS volume.

              Specify Delete to delete the data stored on the EFS volume.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          HomeEfsFileSystem=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "HomeEfsFileSystem": "Retain"|"Delete"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
