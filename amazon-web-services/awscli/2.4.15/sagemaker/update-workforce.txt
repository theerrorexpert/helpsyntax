UPDATE-WORKFORCE()                                          UPDATE-WORKFORCE()



NAME
       update-workforce -

DESCRIPTION
       Use this operation to update your workforce. You can use this operation
       to require that workers use specific IP addresses to work on tasks  and
       to  update your OpenID Connect (OIDC) Identity Provider (IdP) workforce
       configuration.

       Use SourceIpConfig to restrict worker access to  tasks  to  a  specific
       range  of  IP addresses. You specify allowed IP addresses by creating a
       list of up to ten CIDRs . By default, a workforce isn't  restricted  to
       specific  IP addresses. If you specify a range of IP addresses, workers
       who attempt to access tasks using any IP address outside the  specified
       range  are  denied and get a Not Found error message on the worker por-
       tal.

       Use OidcConfig to update the configuration of a workforce created using
       your own OIDC IdP.

       WARNING:
          You  can  only  update your OIDC IdP configuration when there are no
          work teams associated with your workforce. You can delete work teams
          using the operation.

       After  restricting  access  to a range of IP addresses or updating your
       OIDC IdP configuration with this operation, you can view details  about
       your update workforce using the operation.

       WARNING:
          This operation only applies to private workforces.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

       JSON Syntax:

          figuration for a workforce made using your own IdP.

          ClientId -> (string)
              The OIDC IdP client ID used to configure your private workforce.

          ClientSecret -> (string)
              The  OIDC IdP client secret used to configure your private work-
              force.

          Issuer -> (string)
              The OIDC IdP issuer used to configure your private workforce.

          AuthorizationEndpoint -> (string)

              The OIDC IdP token endpoint used to configure your private work-
              force.

          UserInfoEndpoint -> (string)

              private workforce.

          LogoutEndpoint -> (string)
              The  OIDC  IdP  logout  endpoint  used to configure your private
              workforce.

          JwksUri -> (string)
              The OIDC IdP JSON Web Key Set (Jwks) URI used to configure  your
              private workforce.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ClientId=string,ClientSecret=string,Issuer=string,AuthorizationEndpoint=string,TokenEndpoint=string,UserInfoEndpoint=string,LogoutEndpoint=string,JwksUri=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ClientId": "string",
            "ClientSecret": "string",
            "Issuer": "string",
            "AuthorizationEndpoint": "string",

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
