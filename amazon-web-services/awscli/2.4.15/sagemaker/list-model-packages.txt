LIST-MODEL-PACKAGES()                                    LIST-MODEL-PACKAGES()



NAME
       list-model-packages -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the model packages that have been created.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-model-packages is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: ModelPackageSummaryList

OPTIONS
       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only model packages created after  the  speci-
          fied time (timestamp).

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A  filter that returns only model packages created before the speci-
          fied time (timestamp).

       --name-contains (string)
          A string in the model package name. This filter returns  only  model
          packages whose name contains the specified string.

       --model-approval-status (string)
          A  filter  that  returns  only the model packages with the specified
          approval status.

          Possible values:

          o Approved

          o Rejected

          o PendingManualApproval

       --model-package-group-name (string)
          A filter that returns only model versions that belong to the  speci-
          fied model group.

       --model-package-type (string)
          A filter that returns only the model packages of the specified type.
          This can be one of the following values.

          o UNVERSIONED - List only unversioined models. This is  the  default
            value if no ModelPackageType is specified.

          o VERSIONED - List only versioned models.

          o BOTH - List both versioned and unversioned models.

          Possible values:

          o Versioned

          o Unversioned

          o Both

       --sort-by (string)
          The parameter by which to sort the results. The default is Creation-
          Time .

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreationTime

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for the results. The default is Ascending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ModelPackageSummaryList -> (list)
          An array of ModelPackageSummary objects, each of which lists a model
          package.

          (structure)
              Provides summary information about a model package.

              ModelPackageName -> (string)
                 The name of the model package.

              ModelPackageGroupName -> (string)
                 If the model package is a versioned model,  the  model  group
                 that the versioned model belongs to.

              ModelPackageVersion -> (integer)
                 If the model package is a versioned model, the version of the
                 model.

              ModelPackageArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the model package.

              ModelPackageDescription -> (string)

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp that shows when the model package was created.

              ModelPackageStatus -> (string)
                 The overall status of the model package.

              ModelApprovalStatus -> (string)
                 The approval status of the model. This can be one of the fol-
                 lowing values.

                 o APPROVED - The model is approved

                 o REJECTED - The model is rejected.

                 o PENDING_MANUAL_APPROVAL  -  The model is waiting for manual
                   approval.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response is truncated, Amazon SageMaker returns  this  token.
          To retrieve the next set of model packages, use it in the subsequent
          request.
