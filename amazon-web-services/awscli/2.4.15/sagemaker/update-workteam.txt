SYNOPSIS
            update-workteam
          --workteam-name <value>
          [--member-definitions <value>]
          [--description <value>]
          [--notification-configuration <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --workteam-name (string)
          The name of the work team to update.

       --member-definitions (list)
          A list of MemberDefinition objects that contains objects that  iden-
          tify the workers that make up the work team.

          Workforces  can  be  created  using  Amazon Cognito or your own OIDC
          Identity Provider (IdP). For private workforces created using Amazon
          Cognito  use  CognitoMemberDefinition . For workforces created using
          your own OIDC identity provider (IdP) use OidcMemberDefinition . You
          should  not  provide  input for both of these parameters in a single
          request.

          For workforces created using Amazon Cognito, private work teams cor-
          respond  to  Amazon Cognito user groups within the user pool used to
          create a workforce. All of the CognitoMemberDefinition objects  that
          make  up the member definition must have the same ClientId and User-
          Pool values. To add a Amazon  Cognito  user  group  to  an  existing
          worker pool, see Adding groups to a User Pool . For more information
          about user pools, see `Amazon Cognito User Pools .

          For workforces created using your own OIDC  IdP,  specify  the  user
          groups  that  you  want to include in your private work team in Oid-
          cMemberDefinition by listing those groups in Groups . Be aware  that
          user groups that are already in the work team must also be listed in
          Groups when you make this request to remain on the work team. If you
          do  not include these user groups, they will no longer be associated
          with the work team you update.

          (structure)
              Defines an Amazon Cognito or your own OIDC IdP user  group  that
              is part of a work team.

              CognitoMemberDefinition -> (structure)
                 The  Amazon Cognito user group that is part of the work team.

                 UserPool -> (string)
                     An identifier for a user pool. The user pool must  be  in
                     the same region as the service that you are calling.

                 UserGroup -> (string)
                     An identifier for a user group.

                 ClientId -> (string)
                     An  identifier for an application client. You must create
                     the app client ID using Amazon Cognito.

              OidcMemberDefinition -> (structure)
                 A list user groups that exist in your OIDC Identity  Provider
                 (IdP).  One to ten groups can be used to create a single pri-
                 vate work team. When you add a user  group  to  the  list  of
                 Groups  ,  you can add that user group to one or more private
                 work teams. If you add a user group to a private  work  team,
                 all workers in that user group are added to the work team.

                 Groups -> (list)
                     A  list  of  comma seperated strings that identifies user
                     groups in your OIDC IdP. Each user group is made up of  a
                     group of private workers.

                     (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CognitoMemberDefinition={UserPool=string,UserGroup=string,ClientId=string},OidcMemberDefinition={Groups=[string,string]} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "CognitoMemberDefinition": {
                "UserPool": "string",
                "UserGroup": "string",
                "ClientId": "string"
              },
              "OidcMemberDefinition": {
                "Groups": ["string", ...]
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --description (string)
          An updated description for the work team.

       --notification-configuration (structure)
          Configures  SNS  topic  notifications for available or expiring work
          items

          NotificationTopicArn -> (string)
              The ARN for the Amazon SNS topic to which  notifications  should
              be published.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          NotificationTopicArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "NotificationTopicArn": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              Identity  Provider  (IdP).  For private workforces created using
              Amazon Cognito use CognitoMemberDefinition . For workforces cre-
              ated  using  your  own OIDC identity provider (IdP) use OidcMem-
              berDefinition .
