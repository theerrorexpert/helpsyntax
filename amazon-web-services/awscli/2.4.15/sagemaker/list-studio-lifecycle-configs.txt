NAME
       list-studio-lifecycle-configs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  Studio Lifecycle Configurations in your Amazon Web Services
       Account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-studio-lifecycle-configs is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: StudioLifecycleConfigs

OPTIONS
       --name-contains (string)
          A  string  in  the Lifecycle Configuration name. This filter returns
          only Lifecycle Configurations  whose  name  contains  the  specified
          string.

       --app-type-equals (string)
          A  parameter  to search for the App Type to which the Lifecycle Con-
          figuration is attached.

          Possible values:

          o JupyterServer

          o KernelGateway

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only Lifecycle Configurations  created  on  or
          before the specified time.

       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          A  filter  that  returns only Lifecycle Configurations created on or
          after the specified time.

       --modified-time-before (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only Lifecycle Configurations modified  before
          the specified time.

       --modified-time-after (timestamp)
          A  filter  that returns only Lifecycle Configurations modified after
          the specified time.

       --sort-by (string)
          The property used to sort results. The default  value  is  Creation-
          Time.

          Possible values:

          o CreationTime

          o LastModifiedTime

          o Name

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order. The default value is Descending.

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          A token for getting the next set of actions, if there are any.

       StudioLifecycleConfigs -> (list)
          A list of Lifecycle Configurations and their properties.

          (structure)
              Details of the Studio Lifecycle Configuration.

              StudioLifecycleConfigArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  Lifecycle  Configura-
                 tion.

              StudioLifecycleConfigName -> (string)
                 The name of the Studio Lifecycle Configuration.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The creation time of the Studio Lifecycle Configuration.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 This value is equivalent to CreationTime because Studio Life-
                 cycle Configurations are immutable.

              StudioLifecycleConfigAppType -> (string)
                 The  App  type  to  which  the  Lifecycle  Configuration   is
                 attached.
