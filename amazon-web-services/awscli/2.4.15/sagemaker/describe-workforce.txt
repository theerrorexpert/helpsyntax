DESCRIBE-WORKFORCE()                                      DESCRIBE-WORKFORCE()



NAME
       describe-workforce -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  private  workforce information, including workforce name, Amazon
       Resource Name (ARN), and, if applicable, allowed IP address  ranges  (-
       CIDRs  ). Allowable IP address ranges are the IP addresses that workers
       can use to access tasks.

       WARNING:
          This operation applies only to private workforces.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-workforce
          --workforce-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --workforce-name (string)
          The name of the private workforce whose access you want to restrict.
          WorkforceName  is  automatically  set to default when a workforce is
          created and cannot be modified.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Workforce -> (structure)
          A single private workforce, which is automatically created when  you
          create your first private work team. You can create one private work
          force in each Amazon Web Services  Region.  By  default,  any  work-
          force-related  API operation used in a specific region will apply to
          the workforce created in that region. To learn how to create a  pri-
          vate workforce, see Create a Private Workforce .

          WorkforceName -> (string)
              The name of the private workforce.

          WorkforceArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the private workforce.

          LastUpdatedDate -> (timestamp)
              The  most  recent  date that was used to successfully add one or
              more IP address ranges (CIDRs ) to a private  workforce's  allow
              list.

          SourceIpConfig -> (structure)
              A  list  of one to ten IP address ranges (CIDRs ) to be added to
              the  workforce  allow  list.  By  default,  a  workforce   isn't
              restricted to specific IP addresses.

              Cidrs -> (list)
                 A  list  of  one to ten Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)
                 values.

                 Maximum: Ten CIDR values

                 NOTE:
                     The following Length Constraints apply to individual CIDR
                     values in the CIDR value list.

                 social identity providers like Google, Facebook,  Amazon,  or
                 Apple, and through SAML identity providers.

              ClientId -> (string)
