OPTIONS
       --flow-definition-name (string)
          The name of your flow definition.

       --human-loop-request-source (structure)
          Container  for configuring the source of human task requests. Use to
          specify if Amazon Rekognition or Amazon Textract is used as an inte-
          gration source.

          AwsManagedHumanLoopRequestSource -> (string)
              Specifies whether Amazon Rekognition or Amazon Textract are used
              as the integration source. The default field settings  and  JSON
              parsing  rules  are  different  based on the integration source.
              Valid values:

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AwsManagedHumanLoopRequestSource=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AwsManagedHumanLoopRequestSource": "AWS/Rekognition/DetectModerationLabels/Image/V3"|"AWS/Textract/AnalyzeDocument/Forms/V1"
          }

       --human-loop-activation-config (structure)
          An object containing information about the  events  that  trigger  a
          human workflow.

          HumanLoopActivationConditionsConfig -> (structure)
              Container structure for defining under what conditions SageMaker
              creates a human loop.

              HumanLoopActivationConditions -> (string)
                 JSON expressing use-case specific  conditions  declaratively.
                 If any condition is matched, atomic tasks are created against
                 the configured work team. The set of conditions is  different
                 for  Rekognition and Textract. For more information about how
                 to structure the JSON, see JSON Schema for Human Loop Activa-
                 tion  Conditions  in  Amazon Augmented AI in the Amazon Sage-
                 Maker Developer Guide .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          HumanLoopActivationConditionsConfig={HumanLoopActivationConditions=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "HumanLoopActivationConditionsConfig": {
              "HumanLoopActivationConditions": "string"
            }
          }

       --human-loop-config (structure)
          An object containing information about the tasks the human reviewers
          will perform.

          WorkteamArn -> (string)
              Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of a team of workers. To learn more
              about the types of workforces and work teams you can create  and
              use with Amazon A2I, see Create and Manage Workforces .

          HumanTaskUiArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the human task user interface.

              You can use standard HTML and Crowd HTML Elements  to  create  a
              custom  worker  task template. You use this template to create a
              human task UI.

              To learn how to create a custom HTML template, see Create Custom
              Worker Task Template .

              To  learn  how to create a human task UI, which is a worker task
              template that can be used in a flow definition, see  Create  and
              Delete a Worker Task Templates .

          TaskCount -> (integer)
              The number of distinct workers who will perform the same task on
              each object. For example, if TaskCount is set to 3 for an  image
              classification  labeling  job,  three workers will classify each
              input image. Increasing TaskCount can improve label accuracy.

          TaskAvailabilityLifetimeInSeconds -> (integer)
              The length of time that a task remains available for  review  by
              human workers.

          TaskTimeLimitInSeconds -> (integer)
              The  amount  of  time  that a worker has to complete a task. The
              default value is 3,600 seconds (1 hour).

          TaskKeywords -> (list)
              Keywords used to describe the task so that workers can  discover
              the task.

              (string)

          PublicWorkforceTaskPrice -> (structure)
              Defines  the  amount  of money paid to an Amazon Mechanical Turk
              worker for each task performed.

              Use one of the following prices for bounding box  tasks.  Prices
              are  in  US dollars and should be based on the complexity of the
              task; the longer it takes in your initial testing, the more  you
              should offer.

          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FlowDefinitionArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the flow definition you create.
