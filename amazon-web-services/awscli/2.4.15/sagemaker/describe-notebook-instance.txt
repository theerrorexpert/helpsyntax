NAME
       describe-notebook-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about a notebook instance.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-notebook-instance
          --notebook-instance-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --notebook-instance-name (string)
          The name of the notebook instance that you want information about.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NotebookInstanceArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the notebook instance.

       NotebookInstanceName -> (string)
          The name of the Amazon SageMaker notebook instance.

       NotebookInstanceStatus -> (string)
          The status of the notebook instance.

       FailureReason -> (string)
          If status is Failed , the reason it failed.

       Url -> (string)
          The URL that you use to connect to the Jupyter notebook that is run-
          ning in your notebook instance.

       InstanceType -> (string)
          The type of ML compute instance running on the notebook instance.

       SubnetId -> (string)
          The ID of the VPC subnet.

       SecurityGroups -> (list)
          The IDs of the VPC security groups.

          (string)

       RoleArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role associated  with  the
          instance.

       KmsKeyId -> (string)
          The  Amazon Web Services KMS key ID Amazon SageMaker uses to encrypt
          data when storing it on  the  ML  storage  volume  attached  to  the
          instance.

       NetworkInterfaceId -> (string)
          The  network interface IDs that Amazon SageMaker created at the time
          of creating the instance.

       LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
          A timestamp. Use this parameter to retrieve the time when the  note-
          book instance was last modified.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          A timestamp. Use this parameter to return the time when the notebook
          instance was created

       NotebookInstanceLifecycleConfigName -> (string)
          Returns the name of a notebook instance lifecycle configuration.

          For information about notebook  instance  lifestyle  configurations,
          see Step 2.1: (Optional) Customize a Notebook Instance

       DirectInternetAccess -> (string)
          Describes  whether  Amazon SageMaker provides internet access to the
          notebook instance. If this value is set to Disabled ,  the  notebook
          instance does not have internet access, and cannot connect to Amazon
          SageMaker training and endpoint services.

          For more information, see Notebook Instances Are Internet-Enabled by
          Default .

       VolumeSizeInGB -> (integer)
          The  size,  in GB, of the ML storage volume attached to the notebook
          instance.

       AcceleratorTypes -> (list)
          A list of the Elastic Inference (EI) instance types associated  with
          this  notebook  instance. Currently only one EI instance type can be
          associated with a notebook instance. For more information, see Using
          Elastic Inference in Amazon SageMaker .

          (string)

       DefaultCodeRepository -> (string)
          The  Git  repository  associated  with  the notebook instance as its
          default code repository. This can be either the name of a Git repos-
          itory  stored  as  a  resource  in your account, or the URL of a Git
          repository in Amazon Web Services CodeCommit or  in  any  other  Git
          repository.  When  you  open  a  notebook  instance, it opens in the
          directory that contains this repository. For more  information,  see
          Associating   Git   Repositories   with  Amazon  SageMaker  Notebook
          Instances .

       AdditionalCodeRepositories -> (list)
          An array of up to three Git repositories associated with  the  note-
          book  instance.  These  can  be either the names of Git repositories
          stored as resources in your account, or the URL of Git  repositories
          in  Amazon  Web  Services CodeCommit or in any other Git repository.
          These repositories are cloned at  the  same  level  as  the  default
          repository  of  your  notebook  instance.  For more information, see
          Associating  Git  Repositories  with   Amazon   SageMaker   Notebook
          Instances .

          (string)

       RootAccess -> (string)
          Whether root access is enabled or disabled for users of the notebook
          instance.

          NOTE:
              Lifecycle configurations need root access to be able to set up a
              notebook  instance.  Because  of  this, lifecycle configurations
              associated with a notebook instance always run with root  access
              even if you disable root access for users.

       PlatformIdentifier -> (string)
          The  platform  identifier  of the notebook instance runtime environ-
          ment.
