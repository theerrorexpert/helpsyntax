LIST-PROCESSING-JOBS()                                  LIST-PROCESSING-JOBS()



NAME
       list-processing-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists processing jobs that satisfy various filters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-processing-jobs  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: ProcessingJobSummaries

OPTIONS
       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only processing jobs created after the  speci-
          fied time.

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A  filter that returns only processing jobs created after the speci-
          fied time.

       --last-modified-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only processing jobs modified after the speci-
          fied time.

       --last-modified-time-before (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only processing jobs modified before the spec-
          ified time.

       --name-contains (string)
          A string in the processing job name. This filter returns  only  pro-
          cessing jobs whose name contains the specified string.

       --status-equals (string)
          A filter that retrieves only processing jobs with a specific status.

          Possible values:

          o InProgress

          o Completed

          o Failed

          o Stopping

          o Stopped

       --sort-by (string)
          The field to sort results by. The default is CreationTime .

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreationTime

          o Status

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for results. The default is Ascending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ProcessingJobSummaries -> (list)
          An  array of ProcessingJobSummary objects, each listing a processing
          job.

              Summary of information about a processing job.

              ProcessingJobName -> (string)
                 The name of the processing job.

              ProcessingJobArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the processing job..

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the processing job was created.

              ProcessingEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the processing job completed.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp that indicates the last time the  processing  job
                 was modified.

              ProcessingJobStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the processing job.

              FailureReason -> (string)
                 A  string,  up  to one KB in size, that contains the reason a
                 processing job failed, if it failed.

              ExitMessage -> (string)
                 An optional string, up to one KB in size, that contains meta-
                 data  from  the  processing container when the processing job
                 exits.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response is truncated, Amazon SageMaker returns  this  token.
          To  retrieve  the  next set of processing jobs, use it in the subse-
          quent request.
