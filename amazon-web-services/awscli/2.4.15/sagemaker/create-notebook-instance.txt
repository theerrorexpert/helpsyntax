NAME
       create-notebook-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an Amazon SageMaker notebook instance. A notebook instance is a
       machine learning (ML) compute instance running on a Jupyter notebook.

       In a CreateNotebookInstance request, specify the  type  of  ML  compute
       instance  that you want to run. Amazon SageMaker launches the instance,
       installs common libraries that you can  use  to  explore  datasets  for
       model  training,  and  attaches  an  ML  storage volume to the notebook
       instance.

       Amazon SageMaker also provides a set of example notebooks.  Each  note-
       book demonstrates how to use Amazon SageMaker with a specific algorithm
       or with a machine learning framework.

       After receiving the request, Amazon SageMaker does the following:

       o Creates a network interface in the Amazon SageMaker VPC.

       o (Option) If you specified SubnetId , Amazon SageMaker creates a  net-
         work  interface in your own VPC, which is inferred from the subnet ID
         that you provide in the input. When creating this network  interface,
         Amazon  SageMaker  attaches  the security group that you specified in
         the request to the network interface that it creates in your VPC.

       o Launches an EC2 instance of the type specified in the request in  the
         Amazon  SageMaker  VPC. If you specified SubnetId of your VPC, Amazon
         SageMaker specifies  both  network  interfaces  when  launching  this
         instance. This enables inbound traffic from your own VPC to the note-
         book instance, assuming that the security groups allow it.

       After creating the notebook instance, Amazon SageMaker returns its Ama-
       zon  Resource  Name  (ARN).  You  can't  change  the name of a notebook
       instance after you create it.

       After Amazon SageMaker creates the notebook instance, you  can  connect
       to  the  Jupyter server and work in Jupyter notebooks. For example, you
       can write code to explore a dataset that you can use for  model  train-
       ing, train a model, host models by creating Amazon SageMaker endpoints,
       and validate hosted models.

       For more information, see How It Works .

       --role-arn (string)
          When you send any requests to Amazon Web Services resources from the
          notebook instance, Amazon SageMaker assumes  this  role  to  perform
          tasks on your behalf. You must grant this role necessary permissions
          so Amazon SageMaker can perform these tasks. The policy  must  allow
          the  Amazon  SageMaker  service  principal (sagemaker.amazonaws.com)
          permissions to assume this role. For more  information,  see  Amazon
          SageMaker Roles .

          NOTE:
              To  be able to pass this role to Amazon SageMaker, the caller of
              this API must have the iam:PassRole permission.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a Amazon Web Services Key  Manage-
          ment  Service  key that Amazon SageMaker uses to encrypt data on the
          storage volume attached to your notebook instance. The KMS  key  you
          provide must be enabled. For information, see Enabling and Disabling
          Keys in the Amazon Web Services  Key  Management  Service  Developer
          Guide .

       --tags (list)
          An  array  of  key-value  pairs. You can use tags to categorize your
          Amazon Web Services resources in different  ways,  for  example,  by
          purpose,  owner,  or  environment. For more information, see Tagging
          Amazon Web Services Resources .

              A tag object that consists of a key and an optional value,  used
              to  manage metadata for SageMaker Amazon Web Services resources.

              You can add tags to notebook instances, training jobs,  hyperpa-
              rameter  tuning  jobs,  batch  transform  jobs, models, labeling
              jobs, work teams, endpoint configurations,  and  endpoints.  For
              more  information  on  adding  tags  to SageMaker resources, see

       --direct-internet-access (string)
          Sets  whether Amazon SageMaker provides internet access to the note-
          book instance. If you set this to Disabled this notebook instance is
          able  to  access  resources  only in your VPC, and is not be able to
          connect to Amazon SageMaker training and  endpoint  services  unless
          you configure a NAT Gateway in your VPC.

          For more information, see Notebook Instances Are Internet-Enabled by
          Default . You can set the value of this parameter to  Disabled  only
          if you set a value for the SubnetId parameter.

       --default-code-repository (string)
          A  Git  repository  to  associate  with the notebook instance as its
          default code repository. This can be either the name of a Git repos-
          itory  stored  as  a  resource  in your account, or the URL of a Git
          repository in Amazon Web Services CodeCommit or  in  any  other  Git
          repository.  When  you  open  a  notebook  instance, it opens in the
          directory that contains this repository. For more  information,  see
          Associating   Git   Repositories   with  Amazon  SageMaker  Notebook
          Instances .

       --additional-code-repositories (list)
          An array of up to three Git repositories to associate with the note-
          book  instance.  These  can  be either the names of Git repositories
          stored as resources in your account, or the URL of Git  repositories
          in  Amazon  Web  Services CodeCommit or in any other Git repository.
          These repositories are cloned at  the  same  level  as  the  default
          repository  of  your  notebook  instance.  For more information, see
          Associating  Git  Repositories  with   Amazon   SageMaker   Notebook
          Instances .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --root-access (string)
          Whether root access is enabled or disabled for users of the notebook
          instance. The default value is Enabled .

          NOTE:
              Lifecycle configurations need root access to be able to set up a
              notebook  instance.  Because  of  this, lifecycle configurations
              associated with a notebook instance always run with root  access
              even if you disable root access for users.

          Possible values:

          o Enabled

          o Disabled

       --platform-identifier (string)
          The  platform  identifier  of the notebook instance runtime environ-
          ment.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NotebookInstanceArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the notebook instance.
