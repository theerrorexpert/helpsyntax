NAME
       describe-compilation-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about a model compilation job.

       To  create  a model compilation job, use  CreateCompilationJob . To get
       information about multiple model compilation  jobs,  use   ListCompila-
       tionJobs .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-compilation-job
          --compilation-job-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --compilation-job-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  model  compilation job that you want information
          about.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CompilationJobName -> (string)
          The name of the model compilation job.

       CompilationJobArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the model compilation job.

       CompilationJobStatus -> (string)
          The status of the model compilation job.

       CompilationStartTime -> (timestamp)
          The time when the model compilation job started  the  CompilationJob
          instances.

          You are billed for the time between this timestamp and the timestamp
          in the  DescribeCompilationJobResponse$CompilationEndTime field.  In
          Amazon  CloudWatch  Logs,  the  start  time might be later than this
          time. That's because it takes time to download the compilation  job,
          which depends on the size of the compilation job container.

       CompilationEndTime -> (timestamp)
          The  time  when  the  model  compilation  job  on  a compilation job
          instance ended. For a successful or stopped job, this  is  when  the
          job's  model  artifacts  have  finished uploading. For a failed job,
          this is when Amazon SageMaker detected that the job failed.

       StoppingCondition -> (structure)
          Specifies a limit to how long a model compilation job can run.  When
          the  job  reaches the time limit, Amazon SageMaker ends the compila-
          tion job. Use this API to cap model training costs.

          MaxRuntimeInSeconds -> (integer)
              The maximum length of time, in seconds, that a training or  com-
              pilation job can run.

              For  compilation  jobs, if the job does not complete during this
              time, you will receive a TimeOut error.  We  recommend  starting
              with  900 seconds and increase as necessary based on your model.

              For all other jobs, if the job does  not  complete  during  this
              time, Amazon SageMaker ends the job. When RetryStrategy is spec-
              ified in the job request, MaxRuntimeInSeconds specifies the max-
              imum  time for all of the attempts in total, not each individual
              attempt. The default value is 1 day. The  maximum  value  is  28
              days.

          MaxWaitTimeInSeconds -> (integer)
              The  maximum  length  of  time,  in seconds, that a managed Spot
              training job has to complete. It is the  amount  of  time  spent
              waiting  for  Spot  capacity plus the amount of time the job can
              run. It must be equal to or greater than  MaxRuntimeInSeconds  .
              If  the job does not complete during this time, Amazon SageMaker
              ends the job.

              When RetryStrategy is specified in  the  job  request,  MaxWait-
              TimeInSeconds specifies the maximum time for all of the attempts
              in total, not each individual attempt.

       InferenceImage -> (string)
          The inference image to use when compiling a model. Specify an  image
          only if the target device is a cloud instance.

       ModelPackageVersionArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the versioned model package that
          was provided to SageMaker Neo when you initiated a compilation  job.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The time that the model compilation job was created.

       LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
          The time that the status of the model compilation job was last modi-
          fied.

       FailureReason -> (string)
          If a model compilation job failed, the reason it failed.

       ModelArtifacts -> (structure)
          Information about the location in Amazon S3 that has been configured
          for storing the model artifacts used in the compilation job.

          S3ModelArtifacts -> (string)
              The path of the S3 object that contains the model artifacts. For
              example, s3://bucket-name/keynameprefix/model.tar.gz .

       ModelDigests -> (structure)
          Provides a BLAKE2 hash value  that  identifies  the  compiled  model
          artifacts in Amazon S3.

          ArtifactDigest -> (string)
              Provides  a hash value that uniquely identifies the stored model
              artifacts.

       RoleArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that Amazon  SageMaker
          assumes to perform the model compilation job.

       InputConfig -> (structure)
          Information about the location in Amazon S3 of the input model arti-
          facts, the name and shape of  the  expected  data  inputs,  and  the
          framework in which the model was trained.

          S3Uri -> (string)
              The  S3  path where the model artifacts, which result from model
              training, are stored. This path must point to a single gzip com-
              pressed tar archive (.tar.gz suffix).

          DataInputConfig -> (string)
              Specifies  the  name  and  shape of the expected data inputs for
              your trained model with a JSON dictionary form. The data  inputs
              are  InputConfig$Framework specific.

              o TensorFlow : You must specify the name and shape (NHWC format)
                of the expected data inputs using a dictionary format for your
                trained model. The dictionary formats required for the console
                and CLI are different.

                o Examples for one input:

                  o If using the console, {"input":[1,1024,1024,3]}

                  o If using the CLI, {\"input\":[1,1024,1024,3]}

                o Examples for two inputs:

                  o If   using    the    console,    {"data1":    [1,28,28,1],
                    "data2":[1,28,28,1]}

                  o If     using    the    CLI,    {\"data1\":    [1,28,28,1],
                    \"data2\":[1,28,28,1]}

              o KERAS : You must specify the name and shape (NCHW  format)  of
                expected  data  inputs  using  a  dictionary  format  for your
                trained model. Note that while Keras model artifacts should be
                uploaded in NHWC (channel-last) format, DataInputConfig should
                be specified in NCHW (channel-first)  format.  The  dictionary
                formats required for the console and CLI are different.

                o Examples for one input:

                  o If using the console, {"input_1":[1,3,224,224]}

                  o If using the CLI, {\"input_1\":[1,3,224,224]}

                o Examples for two inputs:

                  o If   using   the   console,   {"input_1":   [1,3,224,224],
                    "input_2":[1,3,224,224]}

                  o If   using   the   CLI,    {\"input_1\":    [1,3,224,224],
                    \"input_2\":[1,3,224,224]}

              o MXNET/ONNX/DARKNET : You must specify the name and shape (NCHW
                format) of the expected data inputs in order using  a  dictio-
                nary  format  for  your  trained model. The dictionary formats
                required for the console and CLI are different.

                o Examples for one input:

                  o If using the console, {"data":[1,3,1024,1024]}

                  o If using the CLI, {\"data\":[1,3,1024,1024]}

                o Examples for two inputs:

                  o If    using    the    console,    {"var1":    [1,1,28,28],
                    "var2":[1,1,28,28]}

                  o If     using     the    CLI,    {\"var1\":    [1,1,28,28],
                    \"var2\":[1,1,28,28]}

              o PyTorch : You can either specify the name and shape (NCHW for-
                mat)  of expected data inputs in order using a dictionary for-
                mat for your trained model or you can specify the  shape  only
                using  a  list format. The dictionary formats required for the
                console and CLI are different. The list formats for  the  con-
                sole and CLI are the same.

                o Examples for one input in dictionary format:

                  o If using the console, {"input0":[1,3,224,224]}

                  o If using the CLI, {\"input0\":[1,3,224,224]}

                o Example for one input in list format: [[1,3,224,224]]

                o Examples for two inputs in dictionary format:

                  o If    using    the    console,    {"input0":[1,3,224,224],
                    "input1":[1,3,224,224]}

                  o If    using    the     CLI,     {\"input0\":[1,3,224,224],
                    \"input1\":[1,3,224,224]}

                o Example  for  two  inputs  in  list  format: [[1,3,224,224],
                  [1,3,224,224]]

              o XGBOOST : input data name and shape are not needed.
                 DataInputConfig supports the following parameters for  CoreML
                 OutputConfig$TargetDevice (ML Model format):

              o shape   :  Input  shape,  for  example  {"input_1":  {"shape":
                [1,224,224,3]}} . In addition to static input  shapes,  CoreML
                converter supports Flexible input shapes:

                o Range  Dimension. You can use the Range Dimension feature if
                  you know the input shape will be within some specific inter-
                  val  in  that  dimension, for example: {"input_1": {"shape":
                  ["1..10", 224, 224, 3]}}

                o Enumerated shapes. Sometimes, the models are trained to work
                  only  on  a select set of inputs. You can enumerate all sup-
                  ported input shapes, for example: {"input_1": {"shape": [[1,
                  224, 224, 3], [1, 160, 160, 3]]}}

              o default_shape  :  Default  input  shape. You can set a default
                shape during conversion for both Range Dimension  and  Enumer-
                ated  Shapes. For example {"input_1": {"shape": ["1..10", 224,
                224, 3], "default_shape": [1, 224, 224, 3]}}

              o type : Input type. Allowed  values:  Image  and  Tensor  .  By
                default,  the  converter  generates an ML Model with inputs of
                type Tensor (MultiArray). User can set input type to be Image.
                Image  input type requires additional input parameters such as
                bias and scale .

              o bias : If the input type is an Image, you need to provide  the
                bias vector.

              o scale  :  If the input type is an Image, you need to provide a
                scale factor.

              CoreML ClassifierConfig parameters can be specified using   Out-
              putConfig$CompilerOptions . CoreML converter supports Tensorflow
              and PyTorch models. CoreML conversion examples:

              o Tensor type input:

                o "DataInputConfig":  {"input_1":  {"shape":   [[1,224,224,3],
                  [1,160,160,3]], "default_shape": [1,224,224,3]}}

              o Tensor type input without input name (PyTorch):

                o "DataInputConfig":         [{"shape":        [[1,3,224,224],
                  [1,3,160,160]], "default_shape": [1,3,224,224]}]

              o Image type input:

                o "DataInputConfig":  {"input_1":  {"shape":   [[1,224,224,3],
                  [1,160,160,3]],   "default_shape":   [1,224,224,3],  "type":
                  "Image", "bias": [-1,-1,-1], "scale": 0.007843137255}}

                o "CompilerOptions":          {"class_labels":           "ima-
                  genet_labels_1000.txt"}

              o Image type input without input name (PyTorch):

                o "DataInputConfig":         [{"shape":        [[1,3,224,224],
                  [1,3,160,160]],  "default_shape":   [1,3,224,224],   "type":
                  "Image", "bias": [-1,-1,-1], "scale": 0.007843137255}]

                o "CompilerOptions":           {"class_labels":          "ima-
                  genet_labels_1000.txt"}

              Depending on the model format, DataInputConfig requires the fol-
              lowing parameters for ml_eia2  OutputConfig:TargetDevice .

              o For  TensorFlow models saved in the SavedModel format, specify
                the input names from signature_def_key  and  the  input  model
                shapes  for DataInputConfig . Specify the signature_def_key in
                `                                 OutputConfig:CompilerOptions
                https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_OutputConfig.html#sagemaker-Type-OutputConfig-CompilerOptions`__
                if the model does not use TensorFlow's default  signature  def
                key. For example:

                o "DataInputConfig": {"inputs": [1, 224, 224, 3]}

                o "CompilerOptions": {"signature_def_key": "serving_custom"}

              o For  TensorFlow  models  saved  as a frozen graph, specify the
                input tensor names and shapes in DataInputConfig and the  out-
                put  tensor  names  for  output_names  in  ` OutputConfig:Com-
                pilerOptions
                https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_OutputConfig.html#sagemaker-Type-OutputConfig-CompilerOptions`__
                . For example:

                o "DataInputConfig": {"input_tensor:0": [1, 224, 224, 3]}

                o "CompilerOptions": {"output_names": ["output_tensor:0"]}

          Framework -> (string)
              Identifies the framework in which the  model  was  trained.  For
              example: TENSORFLOW.

          FrameworkVersion -> (string)
              Specifies  the  framework version to use. This API field is only
              supported for the PyTorch and TensorFlow frameworks.

              For information about framework  versions  supported  for  cloud
              targets and edge devices, see Cloud Supported Instance Types and
              Frameworks and Edge Supported Frameworks .

       OutputConfig -> (structure)
          Information about the output location for the compiled model and the
          target device that the model runs on.

          S3OutputLocation -> (string)
              Identifies  the  S3  bucket  where  you want Amazon SageMaker to
              store      the      model      artifacts.      For      example,
              s3://bucket-name/key-name-prefix .

          TargetDevice -> (string)
              Identifies  the  target  device or the machine learning instance
              that you want to run your model on  after  the  compilation  has
              completed.  Alternatively, you can specify OS, architecture, and
              accelerator using  TargetPlatform fields. It can be used instead
              of TargetPlatform .

          TargetPlatform -> (structure)
              Contains  information about a target platform that you want your
              model to run on, such as OS, architecture, and accelerators.  It
              is an alternative of TargetDevice .

              The  following examples show how to configure the TargetPlatform
              and CompilerOptions JSON strings for popular target platforms:

              o Raspberry Pi 3 Model  B+   "TargetPlatform":  {"Os":  "LINUX",
                "Arch":    "ARM_EABIHF"},       "CompilerOptions":   {'mattr':
                ['+neon']}

              o Jetson TX2  "TargetPlatform": {"Os": "LINUX", "Arch": "ARM64",
                "Accelerator":  "NVIDIA"},     "CompilerOptions": {'gpu-code':
                'sm_62', 'trt-ver': '6.0.1', 'cuda-ver': '10.0'}
