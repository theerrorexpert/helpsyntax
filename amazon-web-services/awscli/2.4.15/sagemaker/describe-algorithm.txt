NAME
       describe-algorithm -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  description  of  the  specified  algorithm  that is in your
       account.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-algorithm
          --algorithm-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --algorithm-name (string)
          The name of the algorithm to describe.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              (structure)
                 Specifies  a  metric  that  the  training algorithm writes to
                 stderr or stdout . Amazon SageMakerhyperparameter tuning cap-
                 tures  all  defined  metrics.  You  specify one metric that a
                 hyperparameter tuning job uses as  its  objective  metric  to
                 choose the best training job.

                 Name -> (string)

                     ing job and gets the value of the metric. For more infor-
                     mation about using regular expressions to define metrics,
                     see Defining Objective Metrics .

              sources to be used by the algorithm.

              (structure)
                 Defines a named input source, called a channel, to be used by
                 an algorithm.

                 Name -> (string)

                     The  allowed  compression  types,  if data compression is
                     used.

                     (string)

                 SupportedInputModes -> (list)
                     The allowed input mode, either FILE or PIPE.

                     In FILE mode, Amazon SageMaker copies the data  from  the
                     input  source  onto  the local Amazon Elastic Block Store
                     (Amazon EBS) volumes before starting your training  algo-
                     rithm. This is the most commonly used input mode.

                     In  PIPE  mode,  Amazon SageMaker streams input data from
                     the source directly to your algorithm without  using  the
                     EBS volume.

                     (string)
                        The  training  input mode that the algorithm supports.
                        For more information about input modes, see Algorithms
                        .
                            Pipe mode

                        If  an  algorithm supports Pipe mode, Amazon SageMaker
                        streams data directly from Amazon S3 to the container.
                            File mode

                        If  an  algorithm  supports File mode, SageMaker down-
                        loads the training data from S3 to the provisioned  ML
                        storage volume, and mounts the directory to the Docker
                        volume for the training container.

                        You must provision the ML storage volume  with  suffi-
                        cient capacity to accommodate the data downloaded from
                        S3. In addition to the training data, the  ML  storage
                        volume  also  stores  the  output model. The algorithm
                        container uses the ML storage  volume  to  also  store
                        intermediate information, if any.

                        For  distributed algorithms, training data is distrib-
                        uted uniformly. Your training duration is  predictable
                        if  the input data objects sizes are approximately the
                        same. SageMaker does not split the files  any  further
                        for  model  training.  If the object sizes are skewed,
                        training won't be optimal as the data distribution  is
                        also  skewed  when  one  host in a training cluster is
                        overloaded, thus becoming a bottleneck in training.
                            FastFile mode

                        If an  algorithm  supports  FastFile  mode,  SageMaker
                        streams data directly from S3 to the container with no
                        code changes, and provides file system access  to  the
                        data. Users can author their training script to inter-
                        act with these files as if they were stored on disk.
                            FastFile mode works best when  the  data  is  read
                            sequentially. Augmented manifest files aren't sup-
                            ported. The startup time is lower when  there  are
                            fewer files in the S3 bucket provided.

          SupportedTuningJobObjectiveMetrics -> (list)
              A  list of the metrics that the algorithm emits that can be used
              as the objective metric in a hyperparameter tuning job.

              (structure)
                 Defines the objective metric for a hyperparameter tuning job.
                 Hyperparameter tuning uses the value of this metric to evalu-
                 ate the training jobs it launches, and returns  the  training
                 job  that  results  in either the highest or lowest value for
                 this metric, depending on the value you specify for the  Type
                 parameter.

                 Type -> (string)
                     Whether to minimize or maximize the objective metric.

                     The Amazon EC2 Container Registry (Amazon ECR) path where
                     inference code is stored.

                     If  you are using your own custom algorithm instead of an
                     algorithm provided by  Amazon  SageMaker,  the  inference
                     code  must  meet  Amazon  SageMaker  requirements. Amazon
                     SageMaker  supports  both  registry/repository[:tag]  and
                     registry/repository[@digest] image path formats. For more
                     information, see Using Your Own  Algorithms  with  Amazon

                     The Amazon S3  path  where  the  model  artifacts,  which
                     result  from  model  training, are stored. This path must
                     point to a single gzip compressed  tar  archive  (.tar.gz
                     suffix).

                     NOTE:
                        The model artifacts must be in an S3 bucket that is in
                        the same region as the model package.

                            Pipe mode

                        If  an  algorithm supports Pipe mode, Amazon SageMaker
                        streams data directly from Amazon S3 to the container.
                            File mode

                        If  an  algorithm  supports File mode, SageMaker down-
                        loads the training data from S3 to the provisioned  ML
                        storage volume, and mounts the directory to the Docker
                        volume for the training container.

                        You must provision the ML storage volume  with  suffi-
                        cient capacity to accommodate the data downloaded from
                        S3. In addition to the training data, the  ML  storage
                        volume  also  stores  the  output model. The algorithm
                        container uses the ML storage  volume  to  also  store
                        intermediate information, if any.

                        For  distributed algorithms, training data is distrib-
                        uted uniformly. Your training duration is  predictable
                        if  the input data objects sizes are approximately the
                        same. SageMaker does not split the files  any  further
                        for  model  training.  If the object sizes are skewed,
                        training won't be optimal as the data distribution  is
                        also  skewed  when  one  host in a training cluster is
                        overloaded, thus becoming a bottleneck in training.
                            FastFile mode

                        If an  algorithm  supports  FastFile  mode,  SageMaker
                        streams data directly from S3 to the container with no
                        code changes, and provides file system access  to  the
                        data. Users can author their training script to inter-
                        act with these files as if they were stored on disk.
                            FastFile mode works best when  the  data  is  read
                            sequentially. Augmented manifest files aren't sup-
                            ported. The startup time is lower when  there  are
                            fewer files in the S3 bucket provided.

                     HyperParameters -> (map)
                        The hyperparameters used for the training job.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (string)

                     InputDataConfig -> (list)
                        An  array  of Channel objects, each of which specifies
                        an input source.

                        (structure)
                            A channel is a named input  source  that  training
                            algorithms can consume.

                            ChannelName -> (string)
                               The name of the channel.

                            DataSource -> (structure)
                               The location of the channel data.

                               S3DataSource -> (structure)
                                   The  S3 location of the data source that is
                                   associated with a channel.

                                   S3DataType -> (string)
                                      If you choose S3Prefix ,  S3Uri  identi-
                                      fies a key name prefix. Amazon SageMaker
                                      uses all objects that match  the  speci-
                                      fied key name prefix for model training.

                                      If you choose ManifestFile , S3Uri iden-
                                      tifies an object that is a manifest file
                                      containing a list of  object  keys  that
                                      you  want  Amazon  SageMaker  to use for
                                      model training.

                                      If you  choose  AugmentedManifestFile  ,
                                      S3Uri  identifies  an  object that is an
                                      augmented manifest file  in  JSON  lines
                                      format.  This file contains the data you
                                      want to use for model training. Augment-
                                      edManifestFile  can  only be used if the
                                      Channel's input mode is Pipe .

                                   S3Uri -> (string)
                                      Depending on the value specified for the
                                      S3DataType  ,  identifies  either  a key
                                      name prefix or a manifest. For example:

                                      o A key  name  prefix  might  look  like
                                        this: s3://bucketname/exampleprefix

                                      o A   manifest  might  look  like  this:
                                        s3://bucketname/example.manifest     A
                                        manifest  is  an  S3 object which is a
                                        JSON file consisting of  an  array  of
                                        elements.  The first element is a pre-
                                        fix which is followed by one  or  more
                                        suffixes. SageMaker appends the suffix
                                        elements to the prefix to get  a  full
                                        set  of  S3Uri  . Note that the prefix
                                        must be a valid non-empty  S3Uri  that
                                        precludes users from specifying a man-
                                        ifest  whose   individual   S3Uri   is
                                        sourced from different S3 buckets. The
                                        following code example shows  a  valid
                                        manifest    format:     [   {"prefix":
                                        "s3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/"},

                                        "relative/path/custdata-N"    ]   This
                                        JSON is equivalent  to  the  following

                                        S3Uri  points  to  must be readable by
                                        the IAM  role  that  Amazon  SageMaker
                                        uses  to perform tasks on your behalf.

                                   S3DataDistributionType -> (string)

                                      If  you  want Amazon SageMaker to repli-
                                      cate a subset of data on each ML compute

                                      training, specify  ShardedByS3Key  .  If
                                      there   are   n   ML  compute  instances
                                      launched  for  a  training   job,   each
                                      instance  gets  approximately 1/n of the
                                      number of  S3  objects.  In  this  case,
                                      model training on each machine uses only
                                      the subset of training data.

                                      Don't choose more ML  compute  instances
                                      for  training than available S3 objects.
                                      If you do, some nodes won't get any data
                                      and  you  will pay for nodes that aren't
                                      getting any training data. This  applies
                                      in  both  File and Pipe modes. Keep this
                                      in mind when developing algorithms.

                                      In distributed training, where  you  use
                                      multiple  ML  compute EC2 instances, you
                                      might choose  ShardedByS3Key  .  If  the
                                      algorithm requires copying training data
                                      to the ML storage volume (when Training-
                                      InputMode  is set to File ), this copies
                                      1/n of the number of objects.

                                   AttributeNames -> (list)
                                      A list of one or more attribute names to
                                      use  that  are found in a specified aug-
                                      mented manifest file.

                               FileSystemDataSource -> (structure)
                                   The file system that is associated  with  a
                                   channel.

                                   FileSystemId -> (string)
                                      The file system id.

                                   FileSystemAccessMode -> (string)
                                      The  access  mode  of  the  mount of the
                                      directory associated with the channel. A
                                      directory  can  be  mounted either in ro
                                      (read-only) or rw (read-write) mode.

                                   FileSystemType -> (string)
                                      The file system type.

                                   DirectoryPath -> (string)
                                      The full path to the directory to  asso-
                                      ciate with the channel.

                            ContentType -> (string)
                               The MIME type of the data.

                            CompressionType -> (string)
                               If training data is compressed, the compression
                               type. The default value is None .  Compression-
                               Type  is  used only in Pipe input mode. In File
                               mode, leave this field unset or set it to None.

                            RecordWrapperType -> (string)
                               Specify  RecordIO  as the value when input data
                               is in raw format  but  the  training  algorithm
                               requires  the  RecordIO  format.  In this case,
                               Amazon  SageMaker  wraps  each  individual   S3
                               object  in a RecordIO record. If the input data
                               is already in RecordIO format, you  don't  need
                               to  set  this  attribute. For more information,
                               see Create a Dataset Using RecordIO .

                               In File mode, leave this field unset or set  it
                               to None.

                            InputMode -> (string)
                               (Optional)  The  input mode to use for the data
                               channel in a training job. If you don't  set  a
                               value for InputMode , Amazon SageMaker uses the
                               value set  for  TrainingInputMode  .  Use  this

                               Storage Service (Amazon S3) to the  provisioned
                               ML storage volume, and mount the directory to a
                               Docker volume, use File input mode.  To  stream
                               data  directly from Amazon S3 to the container,
                               choose Pipe input mode.

                               To use a model for incremental training, choose
                               File input model.

                            ShuffleConfig -> (structure)
                               A  configuration for a shuffle option for input
                               data in a channel.  If  you  use  S3Prefix  for
                               S3DataType  ,  this shuffles the results of the
                               S3 key prefix matches. If you use  ManifestFile
                               ,  the order of the S3 object references in the
                               ManifestFile is shuffled. If you use Augmented-
                               ManifestFile  ,  the order of the JSON lines in
                               the  AugmentedManifestFile  is  shuffled.   The
                               shuffling  order  is  determined using the Seed
                               value.

                               For Pipe input mode, shuffling is done  at  the
                               start  of every epoch. With large datasets this
                               ensures that the order of the training data  is
                               different  for each epoch, it helps reduce bias
                               and  possible  overfitting.  In  a   multi-node
                               training  job  when  ShuffleConfig  is combined
                               with S3DataDistributionType of ShardedByS3Key ,
                               the  data  is shuffled across nodes so that the
                               content sent to a particular node on the  first
                               epoch  might be sent to a different node on the
                               second epoch.

                               Seed -> (long)
                                   Determines the shuffling order in  Shuffle-
                                   Config value.

                     OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
                        the  path  to  the  S3  bucket where you want to store
                        model artifacts. Amazon SageMaker  creates  subfolders
                        for the artifacts.

                        KmsKeyId -> (string)
                            The  Amazon  Web  Services  Key Management Service
                            (Amazon Web Services KMS) key  that  Amazon  Sage-
                            Maker  uses to encrypt the model artifacts at rest
                            using  Amazon  S3  server-side   encryption.   The
                            KmsKeyId can be any of the following formats:

                            o //             KMS             Key            ID
                              "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                            o // Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  a  KMS  Key
                              "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                            o // KMS Key Alias  "alias/ExampleAlias"

                            o // Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS Key Alias
                              "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/Exam-
                              pleAlias"

                            If you use a KMS key ID or an alias  of  your  KMS
                            key,  the  Amazon  SageMaker  execution  role must
                            include permissions to call kms:Encrypt .  If  you
                            don't  provide a KMS key ID, Amazon SageMaker uses
                            the default KMS key for Amazon S3 for your  role's
                            account. Amazon SageMaker uses server-side encryp-
                            tion with KMS-managed keys for OutputDataConfig  .
                            If  you  use  a bucket policy with an s3:PutObject
                            permission   that   only   allows   objects   with
                            server-side  encryption,  set the condition key of
                            s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption to "aws:kms" . For
                            more  information, see KMS-Managed Encryption Keys
                            in the Amazon  Simple  Storage  Service  Developer
                            Guide.

                            The  KMS  key  policy must grant permission to the
                            IAM role that you  specify  in  your  CreateTrain-
                            ingJob , CreateTransformJob , or CreateHyperParam-
                            eterTuningJob requests. For more information,  see

                            Developer Guide .

                        S3OutputPath -> (string)
                            Identifies the S3 path where you want Amazon Sage-
                            Maker to store the model artifacts.  For  example,
                            s3://bucket-name/key-name-prefix .

                     ResourceConfig -> (structure)
                        The  resources, including the ML compute instances and
                        ML storage volumes, to use for model training.

                        InstanceType -> (string)
                            The ML compute instance type.

                        InstanceCount -> (integer)
                            The number of ML compute  instances  to  use.  For
                            distributed training, provide a value greater than
                            1.

                        VolumeSizeInGB -> (integer)
                            The size of the ML storage volume that you want to
                            provision.

                            ML  storage  volumes  store  model  artifacts  and
                            incremental states. Training algorithms might also
                            use  the  ML  storage volume for scratch space. If
                            you want to store the  training  data  in  the  ML
                            storage  volume, choose File as the TrainingInput-
                            Mode in the algorithm specification.

                            You must specify sufficient ML  storage  for  your
                            scenario.

                            NOTE:
                               Amazon SageMaker supports only the General Pur-
                               pose SSD (gp2) ML storage volume type.

                            NOTE:
                               Certain  Nitro-based  instances  include  local
                               storage  with  a fixed total size, dependent on
                               the instance type. When using  these  instances
                               for training, Amazon SageMaker mounts the local
                               instance storage  instead  of  Amazon  EBS  gp2
                               storage.  You  can't  request  a VolumeSizeInGB
                               greater  than  the  total  size  of  the  local
                               instance storage.

                               For a list of instance types that support local
                               instance storage, including the total size  per
                               instance type, see Instance Store Volumes .

                        VolumeKmsKeyId -> (string)
                            The  Amazon Web Services KMS key that Amazon Sage-
                            Maker uses to encrypt data on the  storage  volume
                            attached  to  the  ML compute instance(s) that run
                            the training job.

                            NOTE:
                               Certain  Nitro-based  instances  include  local
                               storage,  dependent on the instance type. Local
                               storage volumes are encrypted using a  hardware
                               module  on  the  instance.  You can't request a
                               VolumeKmsKeyId when using an instance type with
                               local storage.

                               For a list of instance types that support local
                               instance storage, see Instance Store Volumes  .

                               For more information about local instance stor-
                               age encryption, see SSD Instance Store  Volumes
                               .

                            The  VolumeKmsKeyId can be in any of the following
                            formats:

                            o //            KMS             Key             ID
                              "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                            o //  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  a KMS Key
                              "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                     StoppingCondition -> (structure)
                        Specifies a limit to how long a model training job can
                        run. It also specifies how long a managed Spot  train-
                        ing job has to complete. When the job reaches the time
                        limit, Amazon SageMaker ends  the  training  job.  Use
                        this API to cap model training costs.

                        To  stop  a  job, Amazon SageMaker sends the algorithm
                        the SIGTERM signal, which delays job  termination  for
                        120 seconds. Algorithms can use this 120-second window
                        to save the model artifacts.

                        MaxRuntimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                            The maximum length of time,  in  seconds,  that  a
                            training or compilation job can run.

                            For compilation jobs, if the job does not complete
                            during this  time,  you  will  receive  a  TimeOut
                            error.  We recommend starting with 900 seconds and
                            increase as necessary based on your model.

                            For all other jobs, if the job does  not  complete
                            during  this  time, Amazon SageMaker ends the job.
                            When  RetryStrategy  is  specified  in   the   job
                            request, MaxRuntimeInSeconds specifies the maximum
                            time for all of the attempts in  total,  not  each
                            individual  attempt.  The  default value is 1 day.
                            The maximum value is 28 days.

                        MaxWaitTimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                            The maximum length of time,  in  seconds,  that  a
                            managed  Spot  training job has to complete. It is
                            the amount of time spent waiting for Spot capacity
                            plus  the  amount of time the job can run. It must
                            be equal to or greater than MaxRuntimeInSeconds  .
                            If  the  job  does  not complete during this time,
                            Amazon SageMaker ends the job.

                            When  RetryStrategy  is  specified  in   the   job
                            request,  MaxWaitTimeInSeconds specifies the maxi-
                            mum time for all of the  attempts  in  total,  not
                            each individual attempt.

                 TransformJobDefinition -> (structure)
                     The  TransformJobDefinition  object  that  describes  the
                     transform job that Amazon SageMaker runs to validate your
                     algorithm.

                     MaxConcurrentTransforms -> (integer)
                        The  maximum  number  of parallel requests that can be
                        sent to each instance in a transform job. The  default
                        value is 1.

                     MaxPayloadInMB -> (integer)
                        The  maximum payload size allowed, in MB. A payload is
                        the data portion of a record (without metadata).

                     BatchStrategy -> (string)
                        A  string  that  determines  the  number  of   records
                        included in a single mini-batch.
                            SingleRecord  means  only  one  record is used per
                            mini-batch. MultiRecord means a mini-batch is  set
                            to contain as many records that can fit within the
                            MaxPayloadInMB limit.

                     Environment -> (map)
                        The environment variables to set in  the  Docker  con-
                        tainer.  We support up to 16 key and values entries in
                        the map.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (string)

                     TransformInput -> (structure)
                        A description of the input  source  and  the  way  the
                        transform job consumes it.

                        DataSource -> (structure)
                            Describes  the location of the channel data, which
                            is, the S3 location of the  input  data  that  the
                            model can consume.

                            S3DataSource -> (structure)
                               The  S3  location  of  the  data source that is
                               associated with a channel.

                               S3DataType -> (string)
                                   If you choose S3Prefix , S3Uri identifies a
                                   key  name prefix. Amazon SageMaker uses all
                                   objects with the specified key name  prefix
                                   for batch transform.

                                   If  you choose ManifestFile , S3Uri identi-
                                   fies an object that is a manifest file con-
                                   taining a list of object keys that you want
                                   Amazon SageMaker to use  for  batch  trans-
                                   form.

                                   The  following values are compatible: Mani-

                               S3Uri -> (string)
                                   Depending  on  the  value specified for the
                                   S3DataType , identifies either a  key  name
                                   prefix or a manifest. For example:

                                   o A  key  name prefix might look like this:
                                     s3://bucketname/exampleprefix .

                                   o A  manifest   might   look   like   this:
                                     s3://bucketname/example.manifest      The
                                     manifest is an S3 object which is a  JSON
                                     file   with  the  following  format:    [
                                     {"prefix":                     "s3://cus-

                                     tive/path/custdata-N"    ]   The  preced-
                                     ing  JSON  matches the following S3Uris :
                                     s3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/rela-
                                     tive/path/to/custdata-1         s3://cus-

                                     tive/path/custdata-N    The  complete set
                                     of S3Uris in  this  manifest  constitutes
                                     the  input  data for the channel for this
                                     datasource. The object that  each  S3Uris
                                     points  to  must  be  readable by the IAM
                                     role that Amazon SageMaker uses  to  per-
                                     form tasks on your behalf.

                        ContentType -> (string)
                            The  multipurpose  internet  mail extension (MIME)
                            type of the data. Amazon SageMaker uses  the  MIME
                            type  with  each http call to transfer data to the
                            transform job.

                        CompressionType -> (string)
                            If your transform data is compressed, specify  the
                            compression  type.  Amazon SageMaker automatically
                            decompresses  the  data  for  the  transform   job
                            accordingly. The default value is None .

                        SplitType -> (string)
                            The  method  to  use  to split the transform job's
                            data files into smaller batches. Splitting is nec-
                            essary  when  the total size of each object is too
                            large to fit in a single request. You can also use
                            data  splitting to improve performance by process-
                            ing multiple concurrent mini-batches. The  default
                            value for SplitType is None , which indicates that
                            input data files are not split, and  request  pay-
                            loads  contain  the  entire  contents  of an input
                            object. Set the value of this parameter to Line to
                            split  records  on  a  newline character boundary.
                            SplitType also supports a  number  of  record-ori-
                            ented  binary  data  formats.  Currently, the sup-
                            ported record formats are:

                            o RecordIO

                            o TFRecord

                            When  splitting  is  enabled,  the   size   of   a
                            mini-batch  depends  on  the  values of the Batch-
                            Strategy and MaxPayloadInMB parameters.  When  the
                            value  of  BatchStrategy  is  MultiRecord , Amazon
                            SageMaker sends the maximum number of  records  in
                            each  request,  up to the MaxPayloadInMB limit. If
                            the value of BatchStrategy is SingleRecord ,  Ama-
                            zon  SageMaker  sends  individual  records in each
                            request.

                            NOTE:
                               Some data  formats  represent  a  record  as  a
                               binary   payload  wrapped  with  extra  padding
                               bytes. When splitting is applied  to  a  binary
                               data format, padding is removed if the value of
                               BatchStrategy is set to SingleRecord .  Padding
                               is not removed if the value of BatchStrategy is
                               set to MultiRecord .

                     TransformOutput -> (structure)
                        Identifies the Amazon S3 location where you want  Ama-
                        zon  SageMaker  to save the results from the transform
                        job.

                        S3OutputPath -> (string)
                            The Amazon S3 path where you want Amazon SageMaker
                            to  store  the  results  of the transform job. For
                            example, s3://bucket-name/key-name-prefix .

                            For every S3 object used as input for  the  trans-
                            form  job,  batch transform stores the transformed
                            data with an .``out`` suffix  in  a  corresponding
                            subfolder  in  the  location in the output prefix.
                            For  example,  for  the  input  data   stored   at
                            s3://bucket-name/input-name-pre-
                            fix/dataset01/data.csv ,  batch  transform  stores
                            the   transformed  data  at  s3://bucket-name/out-
                            put-name-prefix/input-name-prefix/data.csv.out   .
                            Batch transform doesn't upload partially processed
                            objects. For an input S3 object that contains mul-
                            tiple records, it creates an .``out`` file only if
                            the transform job succeeds  on  the  entire  file.
                            When  the  input contains multiple S3 objects, the
                            batch  transform  job  processes  the  listed   S3
                            objects  and  uploads only the output for success-
                            fully processed objects. If any  object  fails  in
                            the transform job batch transform marks the job as
                            failed to prompt investigation.

                        Accept -> (string)
                            The MIME type used to  specify  the  output  data.
                            Amazon SageMaker uses the MIME type with each http
                            call to transfer data from the transform job.

                        AssembleWith -> (string)
                            Defines how to assemble the results of the  trans-
                            form  job  as  a single S3 object. Choose a format
                            that is most convenient to you. To concatenate the
                            results  in binary format, specify None . To add a
                            newline character at the end of every  transformed
                            record, specify Line .

                        KmsKeyId -> (string)
                            The  Amazon  Web  Services  Key Management Service
                            (Amazon Web Services KMS) key  that  Amazon  Sage-
                            Maker  uses to encrypt the model artifacts at rest
                            using  Amazon  S3  server-side   encryption.   The
                            KmsKeyId can be any of the following formats:

                            o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

                            o Key                                         ARN:
                              arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

                            o Alias name: alias/ExampleAlias

                            o Alias                  name                 ARN:

                              pleAlias

                            If  you  don't  provide a KMS key ID, Amazon Sage-
                            Maker uses the default KMS key for Amazon  S3  for
                            your  role's  account.  For  more information, see

                            The  KMS  key  policy must grant permission to the
                            IAM role that you  specify  in  your   CreateModel
                            request. For more information, see Using Key Poli-

                     TransformResources -> (structure)
                        Identifies the ML compute instances for the  transform
                        job.

                        InstanceType -> (string)
                            The  ML  compute  instance  type for the transform
                            job. If  you  are  using  built-in  algorithms  to
                            transform  moderately sized datasets, we recommend
                            using ml.m4.xlarge or ml.m5.large instance  types.

                        InstanceCount -> (integer)
                            The  number  of ML compute instances to use in the
                            transform job.  For  distributed  transform  jobs,
                            specify  a value greater than 1. The default value
                            is 1 .

                        VolumeKmsKeyId -> (string)
                            The Amazon Web  Services  Key  Management  Service
                            (Amazon  Web  Services  KMS) key that Amazon Sage-
                            Maker uses to encrypt model data  on  the  storage
                            volume attached to the ML compute instance(s) that
                            run the batch transform job.

                            NOTE:
                               Certain  Nitro-based  instances  include  local
                               storage,  dependent on the instance type. Local
                               storage volumes are encrypted using a  hardware
                               module  on  the  instance.  You can't request a
                               VolumeKmsKeyId when using an instance type with
                               local storage.

                               For a list of instance types that support local
                               instance storage, see Instance Store Volumes  .

                            The  VolumeKmsKeyId  can  be  any of the following
                            formats:
