DESCRIBE-FLOW-DEFINITION()                          DESCRIBE-FLOW-DEFINITION()



NAME
       describe-flow-definition -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about the specified flow definition.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-flow-definition
          --flow-definition-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --flow-definition-name (string)
          The name of the flow definition.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FlowDefinitionArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the flow defintion.

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the flow definition.

       FlowDefinitionStatus -> (string)
          The status of the flow definition. Valid values are listed below.

          The timestamp when the flow definition was created.

       HumanLoopRequestSource -> (structure)
          Container for configuring the source of human task requests. Used to
          specify if Amazon Rekognition or Amazon Textract is used as an inte-
          gration source.

          AwsManagedHumanLoopRequestSource -> (string)
              Specifies whether Amazon Rekognition or Amazon Textract are used
              as the integration source. The default field settings  and  JSON
              parsing  rules  are  different  based on the integration source.
              Valid values:

       HumanLoopActivationConfig -> (structure)
          An object containing information about what triggers a human  review
          workflow.

          HumanLoopActivationConditionsConfig -> (structure)
              Container structure for defining under what conditions SageMaker
              creates a human loop.

              HumanLoopActivationConditions -> (string)
                 JSON expressing use-case specific  conditions  declaratively.
                 If any condition is matched, atomic tasks are created against
                 the configured work team. The set of conditions is  different
                 for  Rekognition and Textract. For more information about how
                 to structure the JSON, see JSON Schema for Human Loop Activa-
                 tion  Conditions  in  Amazon Augmented AI in the Amazon Sage-
                 Maker Developer Guide .

       HumanLoopConfig -> (structure)
          An object containing information about who works on  the  task,  the
          workforce task price, and other task details.

          WorkteamArn -> (string)
              Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of a team of workers. To learn more
              about the types of workforces and work teams you can create  and
              use with Amazon A2I, see Create and Manage Workforces .

          HumanTaskUiArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the human task user interface.

              You can use standard HTML and Crowd HTML Elements  to  create  a
              custom  worker  task template. You use this template to create a
              human task UI.

              To learn how to create a custom HTML template, see Create Custom
              Worker Task Template .

              To  learn  how to create a human task UI, which is a worker task
              template that can be used in a flow definition, see  Create  and
              Delete a Worker Task Templates .

          TaskTitle -> (string)
              A title for the human worker task.

          TaskDescription -> (string)
              A description for the human worker task.

          TaskCount -> (integer)
              The number of distinct workers who will perform the same task on
              each object. For example, if TaskCount is set to 3 for an  image
              classification  labeling  job,  three workers will classify each
              input image. Increasing TaskCount can improve label accuracy.

          TaskAvailabilityLifetimeInSeconds -> (integer)
              The length of time that a task remains available for  review  by
              human workers.

          TaskTimeLimitInSeconds -> (integer)
              The  amount  of  time  that a worker has to complete a task. The
              default value is 3,600 seconds (1 hour).

          TaskKeywords -> (list)
              Keywords used to describe the task so that workers can  discover
              the task.

              (string)

          PublicWorkforceTaskPrice -> (structure)
              Defines  the  amount  of money paid to an Amazon Mechanical Turk

              Use one of the following prices for bounding box  tasks.  Prices
              are  in  US dollars and should be based on the complexity of the
              task; the longer it takes in your initial testing, the more  you
              should offer.
