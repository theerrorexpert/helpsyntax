NAME
       describe-edge-packaging-job -

DESCRIPTION
       A description of edge packaging jobs.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-edge-packaging-job
          --edge-packaging-job-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --edge-packaging-job-name (string)
          The name of the edge packaging job.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the edge packaging job.

       ModelVersion -> (string)
          The version of the model.

       RoleArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role  that  enables  Amazon
          SageMaker to download and upload the model, and to contact Neo.

              The  deployment  type  SageMaker  Edge Manager will create. Cur-
              rently only supports Amazon Web Services IoT Greengrass  Version
              2 components.

          PresetDeploymentConfig -> (string)
              The  configuration  used to create deployment artifacts. Specify
              configuration options with a JSON string. The available configu-
              ration options for each type are:

              o ComponentName  (optional)  -  Name of the GreenGrass V2 compo-
                nent. If not specified, the default name generated consists of
                "SagemakerEdgeManager"  and  the  name  of your SageMaker Edge
                Manager packaging job.

              NOTE:
                 Amazon Web Services IoT Greengrass uses semantic versions for
                 components.  Semantic  versions  follow  a*major.minor.patch*
                 number  system.  For  example,  version  1.0.0 represents the
                 first major release for a component.  For  more  information,
                 see the semantic version specification .
