LIST-IMAGES()                                                    LIST-IMAGES()



NAME
       list-images -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the images in your account and their properties. The list can be
       filtered by creation time or modified time, and whether the image  name
       contains a specified string.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-images  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: Images

OPTIONS
       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only images created on or after the  specified
          time.

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only images created on or before the specified
          time.

       --last-modified-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only images modified on or after the specified
          time.

       --last-modified-time-before (timestamp)
          A  filter  that returns only images modified on or before the speci-
          fied time.

       --name-contains (string)
          A filter that returns only images whose name contains the  specified
          string.

       --sort-by (string)
          The  property  used  to  sort  results.  The  default  value is CRE-
          ATION_TIME .

          Possible values:

          o CREATION_TIME

          o LAST_MODIFIED_TIME

          o IMAGE_NAME

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order. The default value is DESCENDING .

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              tainer images that are derived  from  a  common  base  container
              image.  Each of these container images is represented by a Sage-
              Maker ImageVersion .

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 When the image was created.

              Description -> (string)

              DisplayName -> (string)
                 The name of the image as displayed.

              FailureReason -> (string)
                 When a create, update, or delete operation fails, the  reason
                 for the failure.

              ImageArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the image.

              ImageName -> (string)
                 The name of the image.

              ImageStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the image.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 When the image was last modified.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token for getting the next set of images, if there are any.
