DESCRIPTION
       Updates a previously created schedule.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-monitoring-schedule
          --monitoring-schedule-name <value>
          --monitoring-schedule-config <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --monitoring-schedule-name (string)
          The  name of the monitoring schedule. The name must be unique within
          an Amazon Web Services Region within an Amazon Web Services account.

       --monitoring-schedule-config (structure)
          The  configuration object that specifies the monitoring schedule and
          defines the monitoring job.

          ScheduleConfig -> (structure)
              Configures the monitoring schedule.

              ScheduleExpression -> (string)
                 A cron expression that describes details about the monitoring
                 schedule.

                 Currently the only supported cron expressions are:

                 o If  you want to set the job to start every hour, please use
                   the following:  Hourly: cron(0 * ? * * *)

                 o If you want to start the job daily:  cron(0 [00-23] ?  *  *
                   *)

                 For example, the following are valid cron expressions:

                 o Daily at noon UTC: cron(0 12 ? * * *)

                 o Daily at midnight UTC: cron(0 0 ? * * *)

                 To  support running every 6, 12 hours, the following are also
                 supported:
                     cron(0 [00-23]/[01-24] ? * * *)

                 For example, the following are valid cron expressions:

                 o Every 12 hours, starting at 5pm UTC: cron(0 17/12 ? * * *)

                 o Every two hours starting at midnight: cron(0 0/2 ? * * *)

                 NOTE:

                     o Even though the cron expression is set to start at  5PM
                       UTC,  note  that there could be a delay of 0-20 minutes
                       from the actual requested time to run the execution.

                     o We recommend that if you would like a  daily  schedule,
                       you  do  not  provide  this parameter. Amazon SageMaker
                       will pick a time for running every day.

                     An Amazon S3 URI to a script that is called per row prior
                     to running analysis. It can base64 decode the payload and
                     convert  it into a flatted json so that the built-in con-
                     tainer can use the converted data.  Applicable  only  for

                     NOTE:
                        The MaxRuntimeInSeconds cannot exceed the frequency of
                        the  job.  For  data quality and model explainability,
                        this can be up to 3600 seconds for an hourly schedule.
                        For  model  bias  and  model quality hourly schedules,
                        this can be up to 1800 seconds.

                     processing  jobs.  Choose True to encrypt communications.
                     Encryption provides greater security for distributed pro-
                     cessing jobs, but the processing might take longer.

                 EnableNetworkIsolation -> (boolean)
                     Whether  to  allow  inbound and outbound network calls to
                     and from the containers used for the processing job.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       MonitoringScheduleArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the monitoring schedule.
