LIST-LINEAGE-GROUPS()                                    LIST-LINEAGE-GROUPS()



NAME
       list-lineage-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       A  list of lineage groups shared with your Amazon Web Services account.
       For more information, see Cross-Account Lineage Tracking in the  Amazon
       SageMaker Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-lineage-groups is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: LineageGroupSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-lineage-groups
          [--created-after <value>]
          [--created-before <value>]
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --created-after (timestamp)
          A timestamp to filter against lineage groups created after a certain
          point in time.

       --created-before (timestamp)
          A  timestamp  to filter against lineage groups created before a cer-
          tain point in time.

       --sort-by (string)
          The parameter by which to sort the results. The default is Creation-
          Time .

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreationTime

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for the results. The default is Ascending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LineageGroupSummaries -> (list)
          A list of lineage groups and their properties.

          (structure)
              Lists a summary of the properties of a lineage group. A  lineage
              group provides a group of shareable lineage entity resources.

              LineageGroupArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the lineage group resource.

              LineageGroupName -> (string)
                 The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the lineage  group.

              DisplayName -> (string)
                 The display name of the lineage group summary.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The creation time of the lineage group summary.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The last modified time of the lineage group summary.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  response  is  truncated,  SageMaker  returns this token. To
          retrieve the next set  of  algorithms,  use  it  in  the  subsequent
          request.
