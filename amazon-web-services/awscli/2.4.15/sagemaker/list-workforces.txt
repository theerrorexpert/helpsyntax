LIST-WORKFORCES()                                            LIST-WORKFORCES()



NAME
       list-workforces -

DESCRIPTION
       Use this operation to list all private and vendor workforces in an Ama-
       zon Web Services Region. Note that you can only have one private  work-
       force per Amazon Web Services Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-workforces  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Workforces

SYNOPSIS
            list-workforces
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--name-contains <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --sort-by (string)
          Sort workforces using the workforce name or creation date.

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreateDate

       --sort-order (string)
          Sort workforces in ascending or descending order.

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --name-contains (string)
          A filter you can use to search for  workforces  using  part  of  the
          workforce name.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Workforces -> (list)
          A list containing information about your workforce.

          (structure)
              A single private workforce, which is automatically created  when
              you create your first private work team. You can create one pri-
              vate work force in each Amazon Web Services Region. By  default,
              any  workforce-related  API  operation used in a specific region
              will apply to the workforce created in that region. To learn how
              to  create a private workforce, see Create a Private Workforce .

              WorkforceName -> (string)
                 The name of the private workforce.

              WorkforceArn -> (string)

                 A list of one to ten IP address ranges (CIDRs ) to  be  added

                     A list of  one  to  ten  Classless  Inter-Domain  Routing

                     app through Amazon Cognito. Your users can also  sign  in
