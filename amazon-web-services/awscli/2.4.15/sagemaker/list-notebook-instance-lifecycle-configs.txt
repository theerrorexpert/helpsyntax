LIST-NOTEBOOK-INSTANCE-LIFECYCLE-CONLIST-NOTEBOOK-INSTANCE-LIFECYCLE-CONFIGS()



NAME
       list-notebook-instance-lifecycle-configs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists notebook instance lifestyle configurations created with the  Cre-
       ateNotebookInstanceLifecycleConfig API.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-notebook-instance-lifecycle-configs is a paginated operation. Mul-
       tiple  API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set
       of results. You can disable pagination by providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: NotebookInstanceLifecycleConfigs

OPTIONS
       --sort-by (string)
          Sorts the list of results. The default is CreationTime .

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreationTime

          o LastModifiedTime

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for results.

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --name-contains (string)
          A  string  in  the lifecycle configuration name. This filter returns
          only lifecycle configurations  whose  name  contains  the  specified
          string.

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A  filter  that returns only lifecycle configurations that were cre-
          ated before the specified time (timestamp).

       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only lifecycle configurations that  were  cre-
          ated after the specified time (timestamp).

       --last-modified-time-before (timestamp)
          A  filter that returns only lifecycle configurations that were modi-
          fied before the specified time (timestamp).

       --last-modified-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only lifecycle configurations that were  modi-
          fied after the specified time (timestamp).

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response is truncated, Amazon SageMaker returns  this  token.
          To  get the next set of lifecycle configurations, use it in the next
          request.

       NotebookInstanceLifecycleConfigs -> (list)
          An array  of  NotebookInstanceLifecycleConfiguration  objects,  each
          listing a lifecycle configuration.

          (structure)
              Provides  a  summary of a notebook instance lifecycle configura-
              tion.

              NotebookInstanceLifecycleConfigName -> (string)
                 The name of the lifecycle configuration.

              NotebookInstanceLifecycleConfigArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  lifecycle  configura-
                 tion.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  timestamp  that tells when the lifecycle configuration was
                 created.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp that tells when the lifecycle  configuration  was
                 last modified.
