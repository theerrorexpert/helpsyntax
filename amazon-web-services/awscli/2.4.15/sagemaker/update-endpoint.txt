UPDATE-ENDPOINT()                                            UPDATE-ENDPOINT()



NAME
       update-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       Deploys  the  new  EndpointConfig specified in the request, switches to
       using newly created endpoint, and then  deletes  resources  provisioned
       for  the endpoint using the previous EndpointConfig (there is no avail-
       ability loss).

       When Amazon SageMaker receives the request, it sets the endpoint status
       to Updating . After updating the endpoint, it sets the status to InSer-
       vice . To check the status of an endpoint,  use  the   DescribeEndpoint
       API.

       NOTE:
          You  must not delete an EndpointConfig in use by an endpoint that is
          live or while the UpdateEndpoint or  CreateEndpoint  operations  are
          being  performed  on  the  endpoint. To update an endpoint, you must
          create a new EndpointConfig .

          If you delete the EndpointConfig of an endpoint that  is  active  or
          being  created  or updated you may lose visibility into the instance
          type the endpoint is using. The endpoint must be deleted in order to
          stop incurring charges.

SYNOPSIS
            update-endpoint
          --endpoint-name <value>
          --endpoint-config-name <value>
          [--retain-all-variant-properties | --no-retain-all-variant-properties]
          [--exclude-retained-variant-properties <value>]
          [--deployment-config <value>]
          [--retain-deployment-config | --no-retain-deployment-config]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --endpoint-name (string)
          The name of the endpoint whose configuration you want to update.

       --endpoint-config-name (string)
          The name of the new endpoint configuration.

       --retain-all-variant-properties   |  --no-retain-all-variant-properties
       (boolean)
          When updating endpoint resources, enables or disables the  retention
          of  variant  properties  , such as the instance count or the variant
          weight. To retain the variant properties of an endpoint when  updat-
          ing  it, set RetainAllVariantProperties to true . To use the variant
          properties specified in a new EndpointConfig call when  updating  an
          endpoint,  set  RetainAllVariantProperties to false . The default is
          false .

       --exclude-retained-variant-properties (list)
          When you are updating  endpoint  resources  with   UpdateEndpointIn-
          put$RetainAllVariantProperties  ,  whose  value  is  set  to  true ,
          ExcludeRetainedVariantProperties specifies the list of  type   Vari-
          antProperty to override with the values provided by EndpointConfig .
          If you don't specify a value for  ExcludeAllVariantProperties  ,  no
          variant properties are overridden.

          (structure)
              Specifies a production variant property type for an Endpoint.

              If  you  are  updating  an  endpoint with the  UpdateEndpointIn-
              put$RetainAllVariantProperties option set to true , the Variant-
              Property objects listed in  UpdateEndpointInput$ExcludeRetained-
              VariantProperties override the existing  variant  properties  of
              the endpoint.

              VariantPropertyType -> (string)
                 The type of variant property. The supported values are:

                 o DesiredInstanceCount   :  Overrides  the  existing  variant
                   instance  counts  using  the   ProductionVariant$InitialIn-
                   stanceCount  values  in the  CreateEndpointConfigInput$Pro-
                   ductionVariants .

                 o DesiredWeight :  Overrides  the  existing  variant  weights
                   using the  ProductionVariant$InitialVariantWeight values in
                   the  CreateEndpointConfigInput$ProductionVariants .

                 o DataCaptureConfig : (Not currently supported.)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          VariantPropertyType=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "VariantPropertyType": "DesiredInstanceCount"|"DesiredWeight"|"DataCaptureConfig"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --deployment-config (structure)
          The deployment configuration for an  endpoint,  which  contains  the
          desired deployment strategy and rollback configurations.

          BlueGreenUpdatePolicy -> (structure)
              Update policy for a blue/green deployment. If this update policy
              is specified, SageMaker creates a new fleet during  the  deploy-
              ment while maintaining the old fleet. SageMaker flips traffic to
              the new fleet according to the specified traffic routing config-
              uration. Only one update policy should be used in the deployment
              configuration. If no update policy is specified, SageMaker  uses
              a blue/green deployment strategy with all at once traffic shift-
              ing by default.

              TrafficRoutingConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Defines the traffic routing strategy to  shift  traffic  from
                 the old fleet to the new fleet during an endpoint deployment.

                 Type -> (string)
                     Traffic routing strategy type.

                     o ALL_AT_ONCE : Endpoint traffic shifts to the new  fleet
                       in a single step.

                     o CANARY  :  Endpoint  traffic shifts to the new fleet in
                       two steps. The first step is the  canary,  which  is  a
                       small  portion  of  the traffic. The second step is the
                       remainder of the traffic.

                     o LINEAR : Endpoint traffic shifts to the new fleet in  n
                       steps of a configurable size.

                 WaitIntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
                     The  waiting  time (in seconds) between incremental steps
                     to turn on traffic on the new endpoint fleet.

                 CanarySize -> (structure)
                     Batch size for the first step to turn on traffic  on  the
                     new  endpoint  fleet. Value must be less than or equal to
                     50% of the variant's total instance count.

                     Type -> (string)
                        Specifies the endpoint capacity type.

                        o INSTANCE_COUNT : The endpoint activates based on the
                          number of instances.

                        o CAPACITY_PERCENT  :  The endpoint activates based on
                          the specified percentage of capacity.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        Defines the capacity  size,  either  as  a  number  of
                        instances or a capacity percentage.

                 LinearStepSize -> (structure)
                     Batch  size  for  each step to turn on traffic on the new
                     endpoint fleet. Value must be  10-50%  of  the  variant's
                     total instance count.

                     Type -> (string)
                        Specifies the endpoint capacity type.

                        o INSTANCE_COUNT : The endpoint activates based on the
                          number of instances.

                        o CAPACITY_PERCENT : The endpoint activates  based  on
                          the specified percentage of capacity.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        Defines  the  capacity  size,  either  as  a number of
                        instances or a capacity percentage.

              TerminationWaitInSeconds -> (integer)
                 Additional waiting time in seconds after the completion of an
                 endpoint  deployment  before  terminating  the  old  endpoint
                 fleet. Default is 0.

              MaximumExecutionTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
                 Maximum execution timeout for the deployment. Note  that  the
                 timeout  value  should  be larger than the total waiting time
                 specified in TerminationWaitInSeconds and  WaitIntervalInSec-
                 onds .

          AutoRollbackConfiguration -> (structure)
              Automatic  rollback  configuration for handling endpoint deploy-
              ment failures and recovery.

              Alarms -> (list)
                 List of CloudWatch alarms in your account that are configured
                 to  monitor metrics on an endpoint. If any alarms are tripped
                 during a deployment, SageMaker rolls back the deployment.

                 (structure)
                     An Amazon CloudWatch alarm configured to monitor  metrics
                     on an endpoint.

                     AlarmName -> (string)
                        The name of a CloudWatch alarm in your account.

            }
          }

       --retain-deployment-config | --no-retain-deployment-config (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  to  reuse the last deployment configuration. The
          default value is false (the configuration is not reused).

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
