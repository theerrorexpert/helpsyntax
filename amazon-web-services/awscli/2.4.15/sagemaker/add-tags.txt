ADD-TAGS()                                                          ADD-TAGS()



NAME
       add-tags -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  or overwrites one or more tags for the specified Amazon SageMaker
       resource. You can add tags to notebook instances, training jobs, hyper-
       parameter  tuning  jobs,  batch  transform jobs, models, labeling jobs,
       work teams, endpoint configurations, and endpoints.

       Each tag consists of a key and an optional  value.  Tag  keys  must  be
       unique  per  resource.  For  more  information about tags, see For more
       information, see Amazon Web Services Tagging Strategies .

       NOTE:
          Tags that you add to a hyperparameter tuning job by calling this API
          are  also  added to any training jobs that the hyperparameter tuning
          job launches after you call this API, but not to training jobs  that
          the  hyperparameter  tuning job launched before you called this API.
          To make sure that the tags associated with a  hyperparameter  tuning
          job are also added to all training jobs that the hyperparameter tun-
          ing job launches, add the tags when you first create the tuning  job
          by  specifying  them in the Tags parameter of  CreateHyperParameter-
          TuningJob

       NOTE:
          Tags that you add to a SageMaker Studio Domain or  User  Profile  by
          calling  this API are also added to any Apps that the Domain or User
          Profile launches after you call this API, but not to Apps  that  the
          Domain  or User Profile launched before you called this API. To make
          sure that the tags associated with a Domain or User Profile are also
          added  to all Apps that the Domain or User Profile launches, add the
          tags when you first create the Domain or User Profile by  specifying
          them  in the Tags parameter of  CreateDomain or  CreateUserProfile .

SYNOPSIS
            add-tags
          --resource-arn <value>
          --tags <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource that you want to tag.

       --tags (list)
          An  array  of  key-value  pairs. You can use tags to categorize your
          Amazon Web Services resources in different  ways,  for  example,  by
          purpose,  owner,  or  environment. For more information, see Tagging
          Amazon Web Services Resources .

          (structure)
              A tag object that consists of a key and an optional value,  used
              to  manage metadata for SageMaker Amazon Web Services resources.

              You can add tags to notebook instances, training jobs,  hyperpa-
              rameter  tuning  jobs,  batch  transform  jobs, models, labeling
              jobs, work teams, endpoint configurations,  and  endpoints.  For
              more  information  on  adding  tags  to SageMaker resources, see
              AddTags .

              For more information on adding metadata to your Amazon Web  Ser-
              vices  resources  with  tagging, see Tagging Amazon Web Services
              resources . For advice on best practices for managing Amazon Web
              Services  resources  with  tagging,  see Tagging Best Practices:
              Implement an Effective  Amazon  Web  Services  Resource  Tagging
              Strategy .

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag key. Tag keys must be unique per resource.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Tags -> (list)
          A list of tags associated with the Amazon SageMaker resource.

          (structure)

              to manage metadata for SageMaker Amazon Web Services  resources.

              You  can add tags to notebook instances, training jobs, hyperpa-
