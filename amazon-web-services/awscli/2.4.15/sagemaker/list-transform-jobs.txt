LIST-TRANSFORM-JOBS()                                    LIST-TRANSFORM-JOBS()



NAME
       list-transform-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists transform jobs.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-transform-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: TransformJobSummaries

OPTIONS
       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only transform jobs created after  the  speci-
          fied time.

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A  filter that returns only transform jobs created before the speci-
          fied time.

       --last-modified-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only transform jobs modified after the  speci-
          fied time.

       --last-modified-time-before (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only transform jobs modified before the speci-
          fied time.

       --name-contains (string)
          A string in the transform job name. This filter returns only  trans-
          form jobs whose name contains the specified string.

       --status-equals (string)
          A  filter that retrieves only transform jobs with a specific status.

          Possible values:

          o InProgress

          o Completed

          o Failed

          o Stopping

          o Stopped

       --sort-by (string)
          The field to sort results by. The default is CreationTime .

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreationTime

          o Status

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for results. The default is Descending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TransformJobSummaries -> (list)
          An array of TransformJobSummary objects.

          (structure)
              Provides a summary of a transform job. Multiple TransformJobSum-
              mary objects are returned as a  list  after  in  response  to  a
              ListTransformJobs call.

              TransformJobName -> (string)
                 The name of the transform job.

              TransformJobArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the transform job.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp that shows when the transform Job was created.

              TransformEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 Indicates  when  the transform job ends on compute instances.
                 For successful jobs and stopped jobs, this is the exact  time
                 recorded  after  the  results  are uploaded. For failed jobs,
                 this is when Amazon SageMaker detected that the job failed.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 Indicates when the transform job was last modified.

              TransformJobStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the transform job.

              FailureReason -> (string)
                 If the transform job failed, the reason it failed.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response is truncated, Amazon SageMaker returns  this  token.
          To  retrieve  the  next  set  of  transform jobs, use it in the next
          request.
