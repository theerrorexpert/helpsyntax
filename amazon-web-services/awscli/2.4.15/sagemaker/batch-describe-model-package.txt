BATCH-DESCRIBE-MODEL-PACKAGE()                  BATCH-DESCRIBE-MODEL-PACKAGE()



NAME
       batch-describe-model-package -

DESCRIPTION
       This action batch describes a list of versioned model packages

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-describe-model-package
          --model-package-arn-list <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --model-package-arn-list (list)
          The  list of Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the model package groups.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                            If you are using your own custom algorithm instead
                            of  an algorithm provided by Amazon SageMaker, the

                            istry/repository[:tag]    and     registry/reposi-
                            tory[@digest]  image path formats. For more infor-
                            mation, see Using Your Own Algorithms with  Amazon
