LIST-MODEL-QUALITY-JOB-DEFINITIONS()      LIST-MODEL-QUALITY-JOB-DEFINITIONS()



NAME
       list-model-quality-job-definitions -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a  list  of  model  quality  monitoring  job  definitions in your
       account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-model-quality-job-definitions is a paginated  operation.  Multiple
       API  calls  may  be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: JobDefinitionSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-model-quality-job-definitions
          [--endpoint-name <value>]
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--name-contains <value>]
          [--creation-time-before <value>]
          [--creation-time-after <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --endpoint-name (string)
          A  filter that returns only model quality monitoring job definitions
          that are associated with the specified endpoint.

       --sort-by (string)
          The field to sort results by. The default is CreationTime .

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreationTime

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for results. The default is Descending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --name-contains (string)
          A string in the transform job name. This filter returns  only  model
          quality monitoring job definitions whose name contains the specified
          string.

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only model quality monitoring job  definitions
          created before the specified time.

       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          A  filter that returns only model quality monitoring job definitions
          created after the specified time.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       JobDefinitionSummaries -> (list)
          A list of summaries of model quality monitoring job definitions.

          (structure)
              Summary information about a monitoring job.

              MonitoringJobDefinitionName -> (string)
                 The name of the monitoring job.

              MonitoringJobDefinitionArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the monitoring job.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the monitoring job was created.

              EndpointName -> (string)
                 The name of the endpoint that the job monitors.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  response is truncated, Amazon SageMaker returns this token.
          To retrieve the next set of model  quality  monitoring  job  defini-
          tions, use it in the next request.
