NAME
       describe-notebook-instance-lifecycle-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a description of a notebook instance lifecycle configuration.

       For  information  about notebook instance lifestyle configurations, see
       Step 2.1: (Optional) Customize a Notebook Instance .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-notebook-instance-lifecycle-config
          --notebook-instance-lifecycle-config-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --notebook-instance-lifecycle-config-name (string)
          The name of the lifecycle configuration to describe.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NotebookInstanceLifecycleConfigArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the lifecycle configuration.

       NotebookInstanceLifecycleConfigName -> (string)
          The name of the lifecycle configuration.

       OnCreate -> (list)
          The shell script that runs only once, when  you  create  a  notebook
          instance.

          (structure)
              Contains the notebook instance lifecycle configuration script.

              Each lifecycle configuration script has a limit of 16384 charac-
              ters.

              The value of the $PATH environment variable that is available to
              both scripts is /sbin:bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin .

              tions  in  log  group  /aws/sagemaker/NotebookInstances  in  log
              stream [notebook-instance-name]/[LifecycleConfigHook] .

              Lifecycle  configuration  scripts  cannot  run for longer than 5
              minutes. If a script runs for longer than 5  minutes,  it  fails
              and the notebook instance is not created or started.

              tions, see Step 2.1: (Optional) Customize a Notebook Instance  .

              Content -> (string)
                 A  base64-encoded  string  that contains a shell script for a
                 notebook instance lifecycle configuration.

       OnStart -> (list)
          The shell script that runs every time you start a notebook instance,
          including when you create the notebook instance.

          (structure)
              Contains the notebook instance lifecycle configuration script.

              Each lifecycle configuration script has a limit of 16384 charac-
              ters.

              The value of the $PATH environment variable that is available to
              both scripts is /sbin:bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin .

              Lifecycle  configuration  scripts  cannot  run for longer than 5
              minutes. If a script runs for longer than 5  minutes,  it  fails
              and the notebook instance is not created or started.

              Content -> (string)
                 A  base64-encoded  string  that contains a shell script for a
                 notebook instance lifecycle configuration.

       LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
          A timestamp that tells when the  lifecycle  configuration  was  last
          modified.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          A timestamp that tells when the lifecycle configuration was created.
