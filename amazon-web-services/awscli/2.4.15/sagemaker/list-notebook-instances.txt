LIST-NOTEBOOK-INSTANCES()                            LIST-NOTEBOOK-INSTANCES()



NAME
       list-notebook-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of  the  Amazon  SageMaker  notebook instances in the
       requester's account in an Amazon Web Services Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-notebook-instances is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: NotebookInstances

       --notebook-instance-lifecycle-config-name-contains (string)
          A string in the name of a notebook instances lifecycle configuration
          associated with this notebook instance.  This  filter  returns  only
          notebook  instances associated with a lifecycle configuration with a
          name that contains the specified string.

       --default-code-repository-contains (string)
          A string in the name or URL of a Git repository associated with this
          notebook instance. This filter returns only notebook instances asso-
          ciated with a git repository with a name that contains the specified
          string.

       --additional-code-repository-equals (string)
          A  filter  that returns only notebook instances with associated with
          the specified git repository.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT

                 The  Git  repository associated with the notebook instance as
                 its default code repository. This can be either the name of a
                 Git  repository  stored as a resource in your account, or the
                 URL of a Git repository in Amazon Web Services CodeCommit  or
                 in  any  other  Git  repository.  When  you  open  a notebook
                 instance, it opens in the directory that contains this repos-
                 itory. For more information, see Associating Git Repositories

                 of  Git  repositories in Amazon Web Services CodeCommit or in
                 any other Git repository. These repositories  are  cloned  at
                 the  same  level  as  the default repository of your notebook
                 instance. For more information, see Associating Git Reposito-
                 ries with Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instances .
