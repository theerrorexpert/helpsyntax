DESCRIBE-MODEL-PACKAGE()                              DESCRIBE-MODEL-PACKAGE()



NAME
       describe-model-package -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a description of the specified model package, which is used to
       create SageMaker models or list them on  Amazon  Web  Services  Market-
       place.

       To  create  models in SageMaker, buyers can subscribe to model packages
       listed on Amazon Web Services Marketplace.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-model-package
          --model-package-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --model-package-name (string)
          The name or Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the  model  package  to
          describe.

          When  you  specify  a  name,  the name must have 1 to 63 characters.
          Valid characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and - (hyphen).

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     TransformInput -> (structure)
                        A  description  of  the  input  source and the way the
                        transform job consumes it.

                        DataSource -> (structure)
                            Describes the location of the channel data,  which
                            is,  the  S3  location  of the input data that the
                            model can consume.

                            S3DataSource -> (structure)
                               The S3 location of  the  data  source  that  is

                               S3DataType -> (string)
                                   If you choose S3Prefix , S3Uri identifies a
                                   key name prefix. Amazon SageMaker uses  all
                                   objects  with the specified key name prefix
                                   for batch transform.

                                   If you choose ManifestFile , S3Uri  identi-
                                   fies an object that is a manifest file con-
                                   taining a list of object keys that you want
                                   Amazon  SageMaker  to  use for batch trans-
                                   form.

                                   The following values are compatible:  Mani-
                                   festFile , S3Prefix

                                   The following value is not compatible: Aug-

                               S3Uri -> (string)
                                   Depending on the value  specified  for  the
                                   S3DataType  ,  identifies either a key name
                                   prefix or a manifest. For example:

                                   o A key name prefix might look  like  this:
                                     s3://bucketname/exampleprefix .

                                   o A   manifest   might   look   like  this:
                                     s3://bucketname/example.manifest      The
                                     manifest  is an S3 object which is a JSON
                                     file  with  the  following  format:     [
                                     {"prefix":                     "s3://cus-
                                     tomer_bucket/some/prefix/"},       "rela-

                                     tive/path/custdata-N"     ]   The preced-
                                     ing JSON matches the following  S3Uris  :
                                     s3://customer_bucket/some/prefix/rela-
                                     tive/path/to/custdata-1         s3://cus-

                                     tive/path/custdata-N   The  complete  set
                                     of  S3Uris  in  this manifest constitutes
                                     the input data for the channel  for  this
                                     datasource.  The  object that each S3Uris
                                     points to must be  readable  by  the  IAM
                                     role  that  Amazon SageMaker uses to per-
                                     form tasks on your behalf.

                        ContentType -> (string)
                            The multipurpose internet  mail  extension  (MIME)
                            type  of  the data. Amazon SageMaker uses the MIME
                            type with each http call to transfer data  to  the
                            transform job.

                        CompressionType -> (string)
                            If  your transform data is compressed, specify the
                            compression type. Amazon  SageMaker  automatically
                            decompresses   the  data  for  the  transform  job
                            accordingly. The default value is None .

                        SplitType -> (string)
                            The method to use to  split  the  transform  job's
                            data files into smaller batches. Splitting is nec-
                            essary when the total size of each object  is  too
                            large to fit in a single request. You can also use
                            data splitting to improve performance by  process-
                            ing  multiple concurrent mini-batches. The default
                            value for SplitType is None , which indicates that
                            input  data  files are not split, and request pay-
                            loads contain the  entire  contents  of  an  input
                            object. Set the value of this parameter to Line to
                            split records on  a  newline  character  boundary.
                            SplitType  also  supports  a number of record-ori-
                            ented binary data  formats.  Currently,  the  sup-
                            ported record formats are:

                            o RecordIO

                            o TFRecord

                            When   splitting   is   enabled,  the  size  of  a
                            mini-batch depends on the  values  of  the  Batch-
                            Strategy  and  MaxPayloadInMB parameters. When the
                            value of BatchStrategy  is  MultiRecord  ,  Amazon
                            SageMaker  sends  the maximum number of records in
                            each request, up to the MaxPayloadInMB  limit.  If
                            the  value of BatchStrategy is SingleRecord , Ama-
                            zon SageMaker sends  individual  records  in  each
                            request.

                            NOTE:
                               Some  data  formats  represent  a  record  as a
                               binary  payload  wrapped  with  extra   padding
                               bytes.  When  splitting  is applied to a binary
                               data format, padding is removed if the value of
                               BatchStrategy  is set to SingleRecord . Padding
                               is not removed if the value of BatchStrategy is
                               set to MultiRecord .

                     TransformOutput -> (structure)
                        Identifies  the Amazon S3 location where you want Ama-
                        zon SageMaker to save the results from  the  transform
                        job.

                        S3OutputPath -> (string)
                            The Amazon S3 path where you want Amazon SageMaker
                            to store the results of  the  transform  job.  For
                            example, s3://bucket-name/key-name-prefix .

                            For  every  S3 object used as input for the trans-
                            form job, batch transform stores  the  transformed
                            data  with  an  .``out`` suffix in a corresponding
                            subfolder in the location in  the  output  prefix.
                            For   example,   for  the  input  data  stored  at
                            s3://bucket-name/input-name-pre-
                            fix/dataset01/data.csv  ,  batch  transform stores
                            the  transformed  data  at   s3://bucket-name/out-
                            put-name-prefix/input-name-prefix/data.csv.out   .
                            Batch transform doesn't upload partially processed
                            objects. For an input S3 object that contains mul-
                            tiple records, it creates an .``out`` file only if
                            the  transform  job  succeeds  on the entire file.
                            When the input contains multiple S3  objects,  the
                            batch   transform  job  processes  the  listed  S3
                            objects and uploads only the output  for  success-
                            fully  processed  objects.  If any object fails in
                            the transform job batch transform marks the job as
                            failed to prompt investigation.

                        Accept -> (string)
                            The  MIME  type  used  to specify the output data.
                            Amazon SageMaker uses the MIME type with each http
                            call to transfer data from the transform job.

                        AssembleWith -> (string)
                            Defines  how to assemble the results of the trans-
                            form job as a single S3 object.  Choose  a  format
                            that is most convenient to you. To concatenate the
                            results in binary format, specify None . To add  a
                            newline  character at the end of every transformed
                            record, specify Line .

                        KmsKeyId -> (string)
                            The Amazon Web  Services  Key  Management  Service
                            (Amazon  Web  Services  KMS) key that Amazon Sage-
                            Maker uses to encrypt the model artifacts at  rest
                            using   Amazon   S3  server-side  encryption.  The
                            KmsKeyId can be any of the following formats:

                            o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

                            o Key                                         ARN:
                              arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

                            o Alias name: alias/ExampleAlias

                            o Alias                 name                  ARN:
                              arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/Exam-
                              pleAlias

                            If you don't provide a KMS key  ID,  Amazon  Sage-
                            Maker  uses  the default KMS key for Amazon S3 for
                            your role's account.  For  more  information,  see

                            The KMS key policy must grant  permission  to  the
                            IAM  role  that  you  specify in your  CreateModel
                            request. For more information, see Using Key Poli-

                     TransformResources -> (structure)
                        Identifies  the ML compute instances for the transform
                        job.

                        InstanceType -> (string)
                            The ML compute instance  type  for  the  transform
                            job.  If  you  are  using  built-in  algorithms to
                            transform moderately sized datasets, we  recommend
                            using  ml.m4.xlarge or ml.m5.large instance types.

                        InstanceCount -> (integer)
                            The number of ML compute instances to use  in  the
                            transform  job.  For  distributed  transform jobs,
                            specify a value greater than 1. The default  value
                            is 1 .

                        VolumeKmsKeyId -> (string)
                            The  Amazon  Web  Services  Key Management Service
                            (Amazon Web Services KMS) key  that  Amazon  Sage-
                            Maker  uses  to  encrypt model data on the storage
                            volume attached to the ML compute instance(s) that
                            run the batch transform job.

                            NOTE:
                               Certain  Nitro-based  instances  include  local
                               storage, dependent on the instance type.  Local
                               storage  volumes are encrypted using a hardware
                               module on the instance.  You  can't  request  a
                               VolumeKmsKeyId when using an instance type with
                               local storage.

                               For a list of instance types that support local
                               instance  storage, see Instance Store Volumes .

                               .

                            The VolumeKmsKeyId can be  any  of  the  following
                            formats:

                            o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
