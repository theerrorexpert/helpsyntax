CREATE-WORKTEAM()                                            CREATE-WORKTEAM()



NAME
       create-workteam -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a new work team for labeling your data. A work team is defined
       by one or more Amazon Cognito user pools. You  must  first  create  the
       user pools before you can create a work team.

       You cannot create more than 25 work teams in an account and region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-workteam
          --workteam-name <value>
          [--workforce-name <value>]
          --member-definitions <value>
          --description <value>
          [--notification-configuration <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --workteam-name (string)
          The  name of the work team. Use this name to identify the work team.

       --workforce-name (string)
          The name of the workforce.

       --member-definitions (list)
          A list of MemberDefinition objects that contains objects that  iden-
          tify the workers that make up the work team.

          Workforces  can  be  created  using  Amazon Cognito or your own OIDC
          Identity Provider (IdP). For private workforces created using Amazon
          Cognito  use  CognitoMemberDefinition . For workforces created using
          your own OIDC identity provider (IdP) use OidcMemberDefinition .  Do
          not  provide input for both of these parameters in a single request.

          For workforces created using Amazon Cognito, private work teams cor-
          respond  to  Amazon Cognito user groups within the user pool used to
          create a workforce. All of the CognitoMemberDefinition objects  that
          make  up the member definition must have the same ClientId and User-
          Pool values. To add a Amazon  Cognito  user  group  to  an  existing
          worker pool, see Adding groups to a User Pool . For more information
          about user pools, see `Amazon Cognito User Pools .

          For workforces created using your own OIDC  IdP,  specify  the  user
          groups  that  you  want to include in your private work team in Oid-
          cMemberDefinition by listing those groups in Groups .

          (structure)
              Defines an Amazon Cognito or your own OIDC IdP user  group  that
              is part of a work team.

              CognitoMemberDefinition -> (structure)
                 The  Amazon Cognito user group that is part of the work team.

                 UserPool -> (string)
                     An identifier for a user pool. The user pool must  be  in
                     the same region as the service that you are calling.

                 UserGroup -> (string)
                     An identifier for a user group.

                 ClientId -> (string)
                     An  identifier for an application client. You must create
                     the app client ID using Amazon Cognito.

              OidcMemberDefinition -> (structure)
                 A list user groups that exist in your OIDC Identity  Provider
                 (IdP).  One to ten groups can be used to create a single pri-
                 vate work team. When you add a user  group  to  the  list  of
                 Groups  ,  you can add that user group to one or more private
                 work teams. If you add a user group to a private  work  team,
                 all workers in that user group are added to the work team.

                 Groups -> (list)
                     A  list  of  comma seperated strings that identifies user
                     groups in your OIDC IdP. Each user group is made up of  a
                     group of private workers.

          Tags in the Amazon Web Services Billing  and  Cost  Management  User
          Guide .

          (structure)
              A  tag object that consists of a key and an optional value, used
              to manage metadata for SageMaker Amazon Web Services  resources.

              You  can add tags to notebook instances, training jobs, hyperpa-
              rameter tuning jobs,  batch  transform  jobs,  models,  labeling
              jobs,  work  teams,  endpoint configurations, and endpoints. For
              more information on adding  tags  to  SageMaker  resources,  see
              AddTags .

              For  more information on adding metadata to your Amazon Web Ser-
              vices resources with tagging, see Tagging  Amazon  Web  Services
              resources . For advice on best practices for managing Amazon Web
              Services resources with tagging,  see  Tagging  Best  Practices:

              Strategy .

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag key. Tag keys must be unique per resource.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       WorkteamArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the work team. You  can  use  this
          ARN to identify the work team.
