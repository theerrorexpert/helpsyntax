CREATE-WORKFORCE()                                          CREATE-WORKFORCE()



NAME
       create-workforce -

DESCRIPTION
       Use this operation to create a workforce. This operation will return an
       error if a workforce already exists in the Amazon Web  Services  Region
       that  you specify. You can only create one workforce in each Amazon Web
       Services Region per Amazon Web Services account.

       If you want to create a new workforce in an Amazon Web Services  Region
       where  a  workforce already exists, use the API operation to delete the
       existing workforce and then use CreateWorkforce to create a  new  work-
       force.

       To  create a private workforce using Amazon Cognito, you must specify a
       Cognito user pool in CognitoConfig . You can also create an Amazon Cog-
       nito  workforce  using  the Amazon SageMaker console. For more informa-
       tion, see Create a Private Workforce (Amazon Cognito) .

       To create a private workforce using your  own  OIDC  Identity  Provider
       (IdP),  specify  your  IdP  configuration in OidcConfig . Your OIDC IdP
       must support groups because groups are used by Ground Truth and  Amazon
       A2I  to  create  work teams. For more information, see Create a Private
       Workforce (OIDC IdP) .

OPTIONS
       --cognito-config (structure)
          Use this parameter to configure an Amazon Cognito private workforce.

          UserPool -> (string)
              A user pool is a user directory in Amazon Cognito. With  a  user
              pool,  your  users can sign in to your web or mobile app through
              Amazon Cognito. Your users can also sign in through social iden-
              tity  providers  like  Google,  Facebook,  Amazon, or Apple, and

              force.

          ClientId=string,ClientSecret=string,Issuer=string,AuthorizationEndpoint=string,TokenEndpoint=string,UserInfoEndpoint=string,LogoutEndpoint=string,JwksUri=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ClientId": "string",
            "ClientSecret": "string",
            "Issuer": "string",

          range.  By  default,  a  workforce  isn't  restricted to specific IP
          addresses.

       --workforce-name (string)
          The name of the private workforce.

       --tags (list)
          An array of key-value pairs that contain metadata to help you  cate-
          gorize  and organize our workforce. Each tag consists of a key and a
          value, both of which you define.

          (structure)
              A tag object that consists of a key and an optional value,  used
              to  manage metadata for SageMaker Amazon Web Services resources.

              You can add tags to notebook instances, training jobs,  hyperpa-
              rameter  tuning  jobs,  batch  transform  jobs, models, labeling
              jobs, work teams, endpoint configurations,  and  endpoints.  For
              more  information  on  adding  tags  to SageMaker resources, see
              AddTags .

              For more information on adding metadata to your Amazon Web  Ser-
              vices  resources  with  tagging, see Tagging Amazon Web Services
              resources . For advice on best practices for managing Amazon Web
              Services  resources  with  tagging,  see Tagging Best Practices:
              Implement an Effective  Amazon  Web  Services  Resource  Tagging
              Strategy .

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag key. Tag keys must be unique per resource.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       WorkforceArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the workforce.
