NAME
       describe-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the description of an endpoint.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-endpoint
          --endpoint-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --endpoint-name (string)
          The name of the endpoint.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EndpointName -> (string)
          Name of the endpoint.

       EndpointArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint.

          o OutOfService   :  Endpoint  is  not  available  to  take  incoming
            requests.

          o Creating :  CreateEndpoint is executing.

          o Updating :  UpdateEndpoint or   UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapacities
            is executing.

          o SystemUpdating  : Endpoint is undergoing maintenance and cannot be
            updated or deleted or re-scaled until it has completed. This main-
            tenance  operation  does  not change any customer-specified values
            such as VPC config,  KMS  encryption,  model,  instance  type,  or
            instance count.

          o RollingBack  :  Endpoint  fails  to scale up or down or change its
            variant weight and is in the process of rolling back to its previ-
            ous  configuration.  Once the rollback completes, endpoint returns
            to an InService status. This transitional status only  applies  to
            an endpoint that has autoscaling enabled and is undergoing variant
            weight or capacity changes as part  of  an   UpdateEndpointWeight-
            sAndCapacities  call  or when the  UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapaci-
            ties operation is called explicitly.

          o InService : Endpoint is available to process incoming requests.

          o Deleting :  DeleteEndpoint is executing.

          o Failed : Endpoint could not be created, updated, or re-scaled. Use
            DescribeEndpointOutput$FailureReason  for  information  about  the
            failure.  DeleteEndpoint is the only operation that  can  be  per-
            formed on a failed endpoint.

       FailureReason -> (string)
          If  the status of the endpoint is Failed , the reason why it failed.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          A timestamp that shows when the endpoint was created.

       LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
          A timestamp that shows when the endpoint was last modified.

       LastDeploymentConfig -> (structure)
          The most recent deployment configuration for the endpoint.

          BlueGreenUpdatePolicy -> (structure)
              Update policy for a blue/green deployment. If this update policy
              is  specified,  SageMaker creates a new fleet during the deploy-
              ment while maintaining the old fleet. SageMaker flips traffic to
              the new fleet according to the specified traffic routing config-
              uration. Only one update policy should be used in the deployment
              configuration.  If no update policy is specified, SageMaker uses
              a blue/green deployment strategy with all at once traffic shift-
              ing by default.

              TrafficRoutingConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Defines  the  traffic  routing strategy to shift traffic from
                 the old fleet to the new fleet during an endpoint deployment.

                       in a single step.

                     o CANARY : Endpoint traffic shifts to the  new  fleet  in
                       two  steps.  The  first  step is the canary, which is a
                       small portion of the traffic. The second  step  is  the
                       remainder of the traffic.

                     o LINEAR  : Endpoint traffic shifts to the new fleet in n
                       steps of a configurable size.

                          number of instances.

                        o CAPACITY_PERCENT : The endpoint activates  based  on
                          the specified percentage of capacity.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        Defines  the  capacity  size,  either  as  a number of
                        instances or a capacity percentage.

                 LinearStepSize -> (structure)
                     Batch size for each step to turn on traffic  on  the  new

                          number of instances.

                        o CAPACITY_PERCENT  :  The endpoint activates based on
                          the specified percentage of capacity.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        Defines the capacity  size,  either  as  a  number  of
                        instances or a capacity percentage.

              TerminationWaitInSeconds -> (integer)
                 Additional waiting time in seconds after the completion of an
                 endpoint  deployment  before  terminating  the  old  endpoint
                 fleet. Default is 0.

              MaximumExecutionTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
                 Maximum  execution  timeout for the deployment. Note that the
                 timeout value should be larger than the  total  waiting  time
