NAME
       list-model-package-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of the model groups in your Amazon Web Services account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-model-package-groups  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: ModelPackageGroupSummaryList

SYNOPSIS
            list-model-package-groups
          [--creation-time-after <value>]
          [--creation-time-before <value>]
          [--name-contains <value>]
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only model groups created after the  specified
          time.

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only model groups created before the specified
          time.

       --name-contains (string)
          A string in the model group name. This  filter  returns  only  model
          groups whose name contains the specified string.

       --sort-by (string)
          The field to sort results by. The default is CreationTime .

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreationTime

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for results. The default is Ascending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ModelPackageGroupSummaryList -> (list)
          A list of summaries of the model groups in your Amazon Web  Services
          account.

          (structure)
              Summary information about a model group.

              ModelPackageGroupName -> (string)
                 The name of the model group.

              ModelPackageGroupArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the model group.

              ModelPackageGroupDescription -> (string)
                 A description of the model group.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the model group was created.

              ModelPackageGroupStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the model group.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  response  is  truncated,  SageMaker  returns this token. To
          retrieve the next set of model groups,  use  it  in  the  subsequent
          request.
