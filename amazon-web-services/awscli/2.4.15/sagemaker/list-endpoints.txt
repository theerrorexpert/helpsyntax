NAME
       list-endpoints -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists endpoints.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-endpoints  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Endpoints

OPTIONS
       --sort-by (string)
          Sorts the list of results. The default is CreationTime .

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreationTime

          o Status

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for results. The default is Descending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --name-contains (string)
          A string in endpoint names. This filter returns only endpoints whose
          name contains the specified string.

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A  filter  that  returns only endpoints that were created before the
          specified time (timestamp).

       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only endpoints with a  creation  time  greater
          than or equal to the specified time (timestamp).

       --last-modified-time-before (timestamp)
          A  filter  that returns only endpoints that were modified before the
          specified timestamp.

       --last-modified-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only endpoints that were  modified  after  the
          specified timestamp.

       --status-equals (string)
          A filter that returns only endpoints with the specified status.

          Possible values:

          o OutOfService

          o Creating

          o Updating

          o SystemUpdating

          o RollingBack

          o InService

          o Deleting

          o Failed

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Endpoints -> (list)
          An array or endpoint objects.

          (structure)
              Provides summary information for an endpoint.

              EndpointName -> (string)
                 The name of the endpoint.

              EndpointArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp that shows when the endpoint was created.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp that shows when the endpoint was last modified.

              EndpointStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the endpoint.

                 o OutOfService : Endpoint is not available to  take  incoming
                   requests.

                 o Creating :  CreateEndpoint is executing.

                 o Updating  :  UpdateEndpoint or  UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCa-
                   pacities is executing.

                 o SystemUpdating : Endpoint  is  undergoing  maintenance  and
                   cannot be updated or deleted or re-scaled until it has com-
                   pleted. This maintenance operation does not change any cus-
                   tomer-specified  values such as VPC config, KMS encryption,
                   model, instance type, or instance count.

                 o RollingBack : Endpoint fails to scale up or down or  change
                   its variant weight and is in the process of rolling back to
                   its previous configuration. Once  the  rollback  completes,
                   endpoint  returns to an InService status. This transitional
                   status only applies to an  endpoint  that  has  autoscaling
                   enabled  and  is  undergoing  variant  weight  or  capacity
                   changes as part of  an   UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapacities
                   call or when the  UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapacities opera-
                   tion is called explicitly.

                 o InService :  Endpoint  is  available  to  process  incoming
                   requests.

                 o Deleting :  DeleteEndpoint is executing.

                 o Failed  :  Endpoint  could  not  be  created,  updated,  or
                   re-scaled.  Use   DescribeEndpointOutput$FailureReason  for
                   information  about the failure.  DeleteEndpoint is the only
                   operation that can be performed on a failed endpoint.

                 To get a list of endpoints with a specified status,  use  the
                 ListEndpointsInput$StatusEquals filter.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  response is truncated, Amazon SageMaker returns this token.
          To retrieve the next set of training jobs, use it in the  subsequent
          request.
