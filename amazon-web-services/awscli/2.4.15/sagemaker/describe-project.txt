NAME
       describe-project -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the details of a project.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-project
          --project-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --project-name (string)
          The name of the project to describe.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ProjectArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the project.

       ProjectName -> (string)
          The name of the project.

       ProjectId -> (string)
          The ID of the project.

       ProjectDescription -> (string)
          The description of the project.

       ServiceCatalogProvisioningDetails -> (structure)
          Information  used to provision a service catalog product. For infor-
          mation, see What is Amazon Web Services Service Catalog .

          ProductId -> (string)
              The ID of the product to provision.

          ProvisioningArtifactId -> (string)
              The ID of the provisioning artifact.

          PathId -> (string)
              The path identifier of the product. This value  is  optional  if
              the  product has a default path, and required if the product has
              more than one path.

          ProvisioningParameters -> (list)
              A list of key value pairs that you specify when you provision  a
              product.

              (structure)
                 A  key value pair used when you provision a project as a ser-
                 vice catalog product. For information, see What is Amazon Web
                 Services Service Catalog .

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key that identifies a provisioning parameter.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value of the provisioning parameter.

       ServiceCatalogProvisionedProductDetails -> (structure)
          Information about a provisioned service catalog product.

          ProvisionedProductId -> (string)
              The ID of the provisioned product.

          ProvisionedProductStatusMessage -> (string)
              The current status of the product.

              o AVAILABLE  - Stable state, ready to perform any operation. The
                most recent operation succeeded and completed.

              o UNDER_CHANGE - Transitive state.  Operations  performed  might
                not  have  valid  results. Wait for an AVAILABLE status before
                performing operations.

              o TAINTED - Stable state, ready to perform  any  operation.  The
                stack has completed the requested operation but is not exactly
                what was requested. For example, a request to update to a  new
                version  failed  and the stack rolled back to the current ver-
                sion.

              o ERROR - An unexpected error occurred. The provisioned  product
                exists  but the stack is not running. For example, CloudForma-
                tion received a parameter value that was not valid  and  could
                not launch the stack.

              o PLAN_IN_PROGRESS  - Transitive state. The plan operations were
                performed to provision a new product, but resources  have  not
                yet  been created. After reviewing the list of resources to be
                created, execute the plan. Wait for an AVAILABLE status before
                performing operations.

       ProjectStatus -> (string)
          The status of the project.

       CreatedBy -> (structure)
          Information  about  the  user who created or modified an experiment,
          trial, trial component, lineage group, or project.

          UserProfileArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the user's profile.

          UserProfileName -> (string)
              The name of the user's profile.

          DomainId -> (string)
              The domain associated with the user.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The time when the project was created.

       LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp when project was last modified.

       LastModifiedBy -> (structure)
          Information about the user who created or  modified  an  experiment,
          trial, trial component, lineage group, or project.
