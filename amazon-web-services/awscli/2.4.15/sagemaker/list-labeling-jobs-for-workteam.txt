NAME
       list-labeling-jobs-for-workteam -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of labeling jobs assigned to a specified work team.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-labeling-jobs-for-workteam  is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: LabelingJobSummaryList

          [--creation-time-before <value>]
          [--job-reference-code-contains <value>]
          [--sort-by <value>]

OPTIONS
       --workteam-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the work team for which  you  want
          to see labeling jobs for.

       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only labeling jobs created after the specified
          time (timestamp).

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only labeling jobs created before  the  speci-
          fied time (timestamp).

       --job-reference-code-contains (string)
          A  filter  the limits jobs to only the ones whose job reference code
          contains the specified string.

       --sort-by (string)
          The field to sort results by. The default is CreationTime .

          Possible values:

          o CreationTime

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for results. The default is Ascending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LabelingJobSummaryList -> (list)
          An  array  of LabelingJobSummary objects, each describing a labeling

              JobReferenceCode -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier for a labeling job. You can use this to
                 refer to a specific labeling job.

              WorkRequesterAccountId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account ID of  the  account  used  to
                 start the labeling job.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the labeling job was created.

              LabelCounters -> (structure)
                 Provides information about the progress of a labeling job.

                 HumanLabeled -> (integer)
                     The  total  number  of  data  objects  labeled by a human

                 PendingHuman -> (integer)
                     The total number of data objects that need to be  labeled

                 Total -> (integer)
                     The total number of tasks in the labeling job.

              NumberOfHumanWorkersPerDataObject -> (integer)
                 The configured number of workers per data object.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  response is truncated, Amazon SageMaker returns this token.
          To retrieve the next set of labeling jobs, use it in the  subsequent
          request.
