       delete-workforce -

DESCRIPTION
       Use this operation to delete a workforce.

       If  you want to create a new workforce in an Amazon Web Services Region
       where a workforce already exists, use  this  operation  to  delete  the
       existing workforce and then use to create a new workforce.

       WARNING:
          If a private workforce contains one or more work teams, you must use
          the operation to delete all work teams before you delete  the  work-

          work teams, you will recieve a ResourceInUse error.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-workforce
          --workforce-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --workforce-name (string)
          The name of the workforce.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
