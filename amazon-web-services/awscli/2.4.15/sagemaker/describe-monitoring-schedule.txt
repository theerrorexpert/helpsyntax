NAME
       describe-monitoring-schedule -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the schedule for a monitoring job.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-monitoring-schedule
          --monitoring-schedule-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --monitoring-schedule-name (string)
          Name of a previously created monitoring schedule.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       MonitoringScheduleArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the monitoring schedule.

       MonitoringScheduleName -> (string)
          Name of the monitoring schedule.

       MonitoringScheduleStatus -> (string)
          The status of an monitoring job.

       MonitoringType -> (string)
          The  type of the monitoring job that this schedule runs. This is one
          of the following values.

          o DATA_QUALITY - The schedule is for a data quality monitoring  job.

          o MODEL_QUALITY  -  The  schedule  is for a model quality monitoring
            job.

          o MODEL_BIAS - The schedule is for a bias monitoring job.

          o MODEL_EXPLAINABILITY - The schedule is for an explainability moni-
            toring job.

       FailureReason -> (string)
          A  string, up to one KB in size, that contains the reason a monitor-
          ing job failed, if it failed.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The time at which the monitoring job was created.

       LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
          The time at which the monitoring job was last modified.

       MonitoringScheduleConfig -> (structure)
          The configuration object that specifies the monitoring schedule  and
          defines the monitoring job.

          ScheduleConfig -> (structure)
              Configures the monitoring schedule.

              ScheduleExpression -> (string)
                 A cron expression that describes details about the monitoring
                 schedule.

                 Currently the only supported cron expressions are:

                 o If you want to set the job to start every hour, please  use
                   the following:  Hourly: cron(0 * ? * * *)

                 o If  you  want to start the job daily:  cron(0 [00-23] ? * *
                   *)

                 For example, the following are valid cron expressions:

                 o Daily at noon UTC: cron(0 12 ? * * *)

                 o Daily at midnight UTC: cron(0 0 ? * * *)

                 To support running every 6, 12 hours, the following are  also
                 supported:
                     cron(0 [00-23]/[01-24] ? * * *)

                 For example, the following are valid cron expressions:

                 o Every 12 hours, starting at 5pm UTC: cron(0 17/12 ? * * *)

                 o Every two hours starting at midnight: cron(0 0/2 ? * * *)

                 NOTE:

                     o Even  though the cron expression is set to start at 5PM
                       UTC, note that there could be a delay of  0-20  minutes
                       from the actual requested time to run the execution.

                     o We  recommend  that if you would like a daily schedule,
                       you do not provide  this  parameter.  Amazon  SageMaker
                       will pick a time for running every day.

                     to running analysis. It can base64 decode the payload and
                     convert it into a flatted json so that the built-in  con-
                     tainer  can  use  the converted data. Applicable only for

                        the job. For data quality  and  model  explainability,
                        this can be up to 3600 seconds for an hourly schedule.
                        For model bias and  model  quality  hourly  schedules,

                     cessing jobs, but the processing might take longer.

                 EnableNetworkIsolation -> (boolean)
                     Whether to allow inbound and outbound  network  calls  to
