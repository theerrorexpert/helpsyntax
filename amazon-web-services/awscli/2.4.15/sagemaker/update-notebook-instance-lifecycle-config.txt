       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-notebook-instance-lifecycle-config
          --notebook-instance-lifecycle-config-name <value>
          [--on-create <value>]
          [--on-start <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --notebook-instance-lifecycle-config-name (string)
          The name of the lifecycle configuration.

       --on-create (list)
          The shell script that runs only once, when  you  create  a  notebook
          instance. The shell script must be a base64-encoded string.

          (structure)
              Contains the notebook instance lifecycle configuration script.

              Each lifecycle configuration script has a limit of 16384 charac-
              ters.

              The value of the $PATH environment variable that is available to
              both scripts is /sbin:bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin .

              stream [notebook-instance-name]/[LifecycleConfigHook] .

              Lifecycle  configuration  scripts  cannot  run for longer than 5
              minutes. If a script runs for longer than 5  minutes,  it  fails
              and the notebook instance is not created or started.

              Content -> (string)
                 A  base64-encoded  string  that contains a shell script for a
                 notebook instance lifecycle configuration.

       Shorthand Syntax:

       JSON Syntax:

            }
            ...
          ]

       --on-start (list)
          The shell script that runs every time you start a notebook instance,
          including  when  you  create the notebook instance. The shell script
          must be a base64-encoded string.

          (structure)
              Contains the notebook instance lifecycle configuration script.

              Lifecycle configuration scripts cannot run  for  longer  than  5

              Content -> (string)
                 A base64-encoded string that contains a shell  script  for  a
                 notebook instance lifecycle configuration.

       Shorthand Syntax:

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {

          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
