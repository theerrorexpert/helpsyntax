SEARCH()                                                              SEARCH()



NAME
       search -

DESCRIPTION
       Finds  Amazon  SageMaker  resources that match a search query. Matching
       resources are returned  as  a  list  of  SearchRecord  objects  in  the
       response. You can sort the search results by any resource property in a
       ascending or descending order.

       You can  query  against  the  following  value  types:  numeric,  text,
       Boolean, and timestamp.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       search  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in
       order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagi-
       nation  by  providing  the --no-paginate argument.  When using --output
       text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: Results

       --search-expression (structure)
          A Boolean conditional statement. Resources must satisfy this  condi-
          tion to be included in search results. You must provide at least one
          subexpression, filter, or  nested  filter.  The  maximum  number  of
          recursive  SubExpressions  , NestedFilters , and Filters that can be
          included in a SearchExpression object is 50.

          Filters -> (list)
              A list of filter objects.

              (structure)
                 A conditional statement for a search expression that includes
                 a  resource  property,  a  Boolean  operator,  and  a  value.
                 Resources that  match  the  statement  are  returned  in  the
                 results from the  Search API.

                 If  you  specify a Value , but not an Operator , Amazon Sage-
                 Maker uses the equals operator.

                 In search, there are several property types:
                     Metrics

                 To define a metric filter, enter a value using the form "Met-
                 rics.<name>"  ,  where  <name> is a metric name. For example,
                 the following filter  searches  for  training  jobs  with  an
                 "accuracy" metric greater than "0.9" :
                     {

                     "Name": "Metrics.accuracy",

                     "Operator": "GreaterThan",

                     "Value": "0.9"

                     }
                        HyperParameters

                 To  define  a  hyperparameter  filter, enter a value with the
                 form "HyperParameters.<name>" . Decimal hyperparameter values
                 are  treated  as  a  decimal in a comparison if the specified
                 Value is also a decimal value. If the specified Value  is  an
                 integer,  the  decimal  hyperparameter  values are treated as
                 integers. For example, the following filter is  satisfied  by
                 training  jobs  with a "learning_rate" hyperparameter that is
                 less than "0.5" :
                     {

                     "Name": "HyperParameters.learning_rate",

                     "Operator": "LessThan",

                     "Value": "0.5"

                     }
                        Tags

                 To  define  a  tag  filter,  enter  a  value  with  the  form
                 Tags.<key> .

                 Name -> (string)
                     A  resource property name. For example, TrainingJobName .
                     For valid property names, see  SearchRecord  .  You  must
                     specify a valid property for the resource.

                 Operator -> (string)
                     A  Boolean  binary  operator that is used to evaluate the
                     filter. The operator field contains one of the  following
                     values:
                        Equals

                     The value of Name equals Value .
                        NotEquals

                     The value of Name doesn't equal Value .
                        Exists

                     The Name property exists.
                        NotExists

                     The Name property does not exist.
                        GreaterThan

                     The  value  of Name is greater than Value . Not supported
                     for text properties.
                        GreaterThanOrEqualTo

                     The value of Name is greater than or equal to Value . Not
                     supported for text properties.
                        LessThan

                     The  value of Name is less than Value . Not supported for
                     text properties.
                        LessThanOrEqualTo

                     The value of Name is less than or equal to  Value  .  Not
                     supported for text properties.
                        In

                     The  value  of Name is one of the comma delimited strings
                     in Value . Only supported for text properties.
                        Contains

                     The value of Name contains the string Value .  Only  sup-
                     ported for text properties.

                     A SearchExpression can include the Contains operator mul-
                     tiple times when the value of Name is one of the  follow-
                     ing:

                     o Experiment.DisplayName

                     o Experiment.ExperimentName

                     o Experiment.Tags

                     o Trial.DisplayName

                     o Trial.TrialName

                     o Trial.Tags

                     o TrialComponent.DisplayName

                     o TrialComponent.TrialComponentName

                     o TrialComponent.Tags

                     o TrialComponent.InputArtifacts

                     o TrialComponent.OutputArtifacts

                     A SearchExpression can include only one Contains operator
                     for all other values of Name . In  these  cases,  if  you
                     include  multiple Contains operators in the SearchExpres-
                     sion , the result is the following error message:  "'CON-
                     TAINS' operator usage limit of 1 exceeded. "

                 Value -> (string)
                     A  value  used  with Name and Operator to determine which
                     resources satisfy the filter's condition.  For  numerical
                     properties,  Value  must  be an integer or floating-point
                     decimal. For timestamp properties, Value must be  an  ISO
                     8601   date-time   string   of   the   following  format:
                     YYYY-mm-dd'T'HH:MM:SS .

          NestedFilters -> (list)
              A list of nested filter objects.

              (structure)
                 A list of nested  Filter objects. A resource must satisfy the
                 conditions  of  all  filters  to  be  included in the results
                 returned from the  Search API.

                 For example, to filter on a  training  job's  InputDataConfig
                 property  with  a  specific  channel  name  and S3Uri prefix,
                 define the following filters:

                 o '{Name:"InputDataConfig.ChannelName",  "Operator":"Equals",
                   "Value":"train"}',

                 o '{Name:"InputDataConfig.DataSource.S3DataSource.S3Uri",
                   "Operator":"Contains", "Value":"mybucket/catdata"}'

                 NestedPropertyName -> (string)
                     The name of the property to use in  the  nested  filters.
                     The  value  must  match  a  listed property name, such as
                     InputDataConfig .

                 Filters -> (list)
                     A list of filters. Each filter acts on a  property.  Fil-
                     ters  must  contain at least one Filters value. For exam-
                     ple, a NestedFilters call might include a filter  on  the
                     PropertyName  parameter  of the InputDataConfig property:
                     InputDataConfig.DataSource.S3DataSource.S3Uri .

                     (structure)
                        A conditional statement for a search  expression  that
                        includes  a resource property, a Boolean operator, and
                        a  value.  Resources  that  match  the  statement  are
                        returned in the results from the  Search API.

                        If  you specify a Value , but not an Operator , Amazon
                        SageMaker uses the equals operator.

                        In search, there are several property types:
                            Metrics

                        To define a metric filter, enter  a  value  using  the
                        form "Metrics.<name>" , where <name> is a metric name.
                        For example, the following filter searches for  train-
                        ing  jobs with an "accuracy" metric greater than "0.9"
                        :
                            {

                            "Name": "Metrics.accuracy",

                            "Operator": "GreaterThan",

                            "Value": "0.9"

                            }
                               HyperParameters

                        To define a hyperparameter filter, enter a value  with
                        the  form  "HyperParameters.<name>" . Decimal hyperpa-
                        rameter values are treated as a decimal in a  compari-
                        son if the specified Value is also a decimal value. If
                        the specified Value is an integer, the decimal  hyper-
                        parameter values are treated as integers. For example,
                        the following filter is  satisfied  by  training  jobs
                        with  a  "learning_rate"  hyperparameter  that is less
                        than "0.5" :
                            {

                            "Name": "HyperParameters.learning_rate",

                            "Operator": "LessThan",

                            "Value": "0.5"

                            }
                               Tags

                        To define a tag filter, enter a value  with  the  form
                        Tags.<key> .

                        Name -> (string)
                            A  resource  property  name.  For  example, Train-
                            ingJobName  .  For  valid  property   names,   see
                            SearchRecord  .  You must specify a valid property
                            for the resource.

                        Operator -> (string)
                            A Boolean binary operator that is used to evaluate
                            the filter. The operator field contains one of the
                            following values:
                               Equals

                            The value of Name equals Value .
                               NotEquals

                            The value of Name doesn't equal Value .
                               Exists

                            The Name property exists.
                               NotExists

                            The Name property does not exist.
                               GreaterThan

                            The value of Name is greater than Value . Not sup-
                            ported for text properties.
                               GreaterThanOrEqualTo

                            The  value  of  Name  is  greater than or equal to
                            Value . Not supported for text properties.
                               LessThan

                            The value of Name is less than Value  .  Not  sup-

                            The value of Name is one of  the  comma  delimited
                            strings in Value . Only supported for text proper-
                            ties.
                               Contains

                            The value of Name contains the string Value . Only
                            supported for text properties.

                            A SearchExpression can include the Contains opera-
                            tor multiple times when the value of Name  is  one
                            of the following:

                            A  SearchExpression  can include only one Contains
                            operator for all other values of Name .  In  these
                            cases,  if you include multiple Contains operators
                            in the SearchExpression , the result is  the  fol-
                            lowing  error  message: "'CONTAINS' operator usage
                            limit of 1 exceeded. "

                        Value -> (string)
                            A value used with Name and Operator  to  determine
                            which  resources  satisfy  the filter's condition.
                            For numerical properties, Value must be an integer
                            or  floating-point  decimal. For timestamp proper-
                            ties, Value must be an ISO 8601  date-time  string
                            of the following format: YYYY-mm-dd'T'HH:MM:SS .

          SubExpressions -> (list)
              A list of search expression objects.

                 A  multi-expression  that searches for the specified resource
                 or resources in a search. All resource objects  that  satisfy
                 the   expression's  condition  are  included  in  the  search
                 results. You must specify at least one subexpression, filter,
                 or nested filter. A SearchExpression can contain up to twenty
                 elements.

                 A SearchExpression contains the following components:

                 o A list of Filter objects.  Each  filter  defines  a  simple
                   Boolean  expression  comprised of a resource property name,
                   Boolean operator, and value.

                 o A list of NestedFilter objects. Each nested filter  defines
                   a  list  of  Boolean  expressions  using a list of resource
                   properties. A nested filter is satisfied if a single object
                   in the list satisfies all Boolean expressions.

                 o A  list  of  SearchExpression  objects. A search expression
                   object can  be  nested  in  a  list  of  search  expression
                   objects.

                 o A Boolean operator: And or Or .

                 Filters -> (list)
                     A list of filter objects.

                     (structure)
                        A  conditional  statement for a search expression that
                        includes a resource property, a Boolean operator,  and
                        a  value.  Resources  that  match  the  statement  are
                        returned in the results from the  Search API.

                        If you specify a Value , but not an Operator ,  Amazon
                        SageMaker uses the equals operator.

                        In search, there are several property types:
                            Metrics

                        To  define  a  metric  filter, enter a value using the
                        form "Metrics.<name>" , where <name> is a metric name.
                        For  example, the following filter searches for train-
                        ing jobs with an "accuracy" metric greater than  "0.9"
                        :
                            {

                            "Name": "Metrics.accuracy",

                            "Operator": "GreaterThan",

                            "Value": "0.9"

                            }
                               HyperParameters

                        To  define a hyperparameter filter, enter a value with
                        the form "HyperParameters.<name>" .  Decimal  hyperpa-
                        rameter  values are treated as a decimal in a compari-
                        son if the specified Value is also a decimal value. If
                        the  specified Value is an integer, the decimal hyper-
                        parameter values are treated as integers. For example,
                        the  following  filter  is  satisfied by training jobs
                        with a "learning_rate"  hyperparameter  that  is  less
                        than "0.5" :
                            {

                            "Name": "HyperParameters.learning_rate",

                            "Operator": "LessThan",

                            "Value": "0.5"

                            }
                               Tags

                        To  define  a  tag filter, enter a value with the form
                        Tags.<key> .

                        Name -> (string)
                            A resource  property  name.  For  example,  Train-
                            ingJobName   .   For  valid  property  names,  see
                            SearchRecord . You must specify a  valid  property
                            for the resource.

                        Operator -> (string)
                            A Boolean binary operator that is used to evaluate
                            the filter. The operator field contains one of the
                            following values:
                               Equals

                            The value of Name equals Value .
                               NotEquals

                            The value of Name doesn't equal Value .
                               Exists

                            The Name property exists.
                               NotExists

                            The Name property does not exist.
                               GreaterThan

                            The value of Name is greater than Value . Not sup-
                            ported for text properties.
                               GreaterThanOrEqualTo

                            The value of Name is  greater  than  or  equal  to
                            Value . Not supported for text properties.
                               LessThan

                            The  value  of  Name is less than Value . Not sup-
                            ported for text properties.
                               LessThanOrEqualTo

                            The value of Name is less than or equal to Value .
                            Not supported for text properties.
                               In

                            The  value  of  Name is one of the comma delimited
                            strings in Value . Only supported for text proper-
                            ties.
                               Contains

                            The value of Name contains the string Value . Only
                            supported for text properties.

                            A SearchExpression can include the Contains opera-
                            tor  multiple  times when the value of Name is one
                            of the following:

                            o Experiment.DisplayName

                            o Experiment.ExperimentName

                            o Experiment.Tags

                            o Trial.DisplayName

                            o Trial.TrialName

                            o Trial.Tags

                            o TrialComponent.DisplayName

                            o TrialComponent.TrialComponentName

                            o TrialComponent.Tags

                            o TrialComponent.InputArtifacts

                            o TrialComponent.OutputArtifacts

                            A SearchExpression can include only  one  Contains
                            operator  for  all other values of Name . In these
                            cases, if you include multiple Contains  operators
                            in  the  SearchExpression , the result is the fol-
                            lowing error message: "'CONTAINS'  operator  usage
                            limit of 1 exceeded. "

                        Value -> (string)
                            A  value  used with Name and Operator to determine
                            which resources satisfy  the  filter's  condition.
                            For numerical properties, Value must be an integer
                            or floating-point decimal. For  timestamp  proper-
                            ties,  Value  must be an ISO 8601 date-time string
                            of the following format: YYYY-mm-dd'T'HH:MM:SS .

                 NestedFilters -> (list)
                     A list of nested filter objects.

                     (structure)
                        A list of nested  Filter objects. A resource must sat-
                        isfy  the  conditions of all filters to be included in
                        the results returned from the  Search API.

                        For example, to filter on a training job's  InputData-
                        Config property with a specific channel name and S3Uri
                        prefix, define the following filters:

                        o '{Name:"InputDataConfig.ChannelName",        "Opera-
                          tor":"Equals", "Value":"train"}',

                        o '{Name:"InputDataConfig.DataSource.S3Data-
                          Source.S3Uri",                "Operator":"Contains",
                          "Value":"mybucket/catdata"}'

                        NestedPropertyName -> (string)
                            The name of the property to use in the nested fil-
                            ters. The value must match a listed property name,
                            such as InputDataConfig .

                        Filters -> (list)
                            A list of filters. Each filter acts on a property.
                            Filters must contain at least one  Filters  value.
                            For  example, a NestedFilters call might include a
                            filter on the PropertyName parameter of the Input-
                            DataConfig     property:     InputDataConfig.Data-
                            Source.S3DataSource.S3Uri .

                            (structure)
                               A conditional statement for a search expression
                               that  includes  a  resource property, a Boolean
                               operator, and a value. Resources that match the
                               statement  are returned in the results from the
                               Search API.

                               If you specify a Value , but not an Operator  ,
                               Amazon SageMaker uses the equals operator.

                               In search, there are several property types:
                                   Metrics

                               To  define a metric filter, enter a value using
                               the form "Metrics.<name>" , where <name>  is  a
                               metric  name. For example, the following filter
                               searches for training jobs with  an  "accuracy"
                               metric greater than "0.9" :
                                   {

                                   "Name": "Metrics.accuracy",

                                   "Operator": "GreaterThan",

                                   "Value": "0.9"

                                   }
                                      HyperParameters

                               To  define  a  hyperparameter  filter,  enter a
                               value with the form "HyperParameters.<name>"  .
                               Decimal  hyperparameter values are treated as a
                               decimal in a comparison if the specified  Value
                               is also a decimal value. If the specified Value
                               is an integer, the decimal hyperparameter  val-
                               ues  are  treated as integers. For example, the
                               following filter is satisfied by training  jobs
                               with  a  "learning_rate" hyperparameter that is
                               less than "0.5" :
                                   {

                                   "Name": "HyperParameters.learning_rate",

                                   "Operator": "LessThan",

                                   "Value": "0.5"

                                   }
                                      Tags

                               To define a tag filter, enter a value with  the
                               form Tags.<key> .

                               Name -> (string)
                                   A  resource  property  name.  For  example,
                                   TrainingJobName . For valid property names,
                                   see   SearchRecord  .  You  must  specify a
                                   valid property for the resource.

                               Operator -> (string)
                                   A Boolean binary operator that is  used  to
                                   evaluate  the  filter.  The  operator field
                                   contains one of the following values:
                                      Equals

                                   The value of Name equals Value .
                                      NotEquals

                                   The value of Name doesn't equal Value .
                                      Exists

                                   The Name property exists.
                                      NotExists

                                   The Name property does not exist.
                                      GreaterThan

                                   The value of Name is greater than  Value  .
                                   Not supported for text properties.
                                      GreaterThanOrEqualTo

                                   The  value of Name is greater than or equal
                                   to Value . Not supported for  text  proper-
                                   ties.
                                      LessThan

                                   The  value of Name is less than Value . Not
                                   supported for text properties.
                                      LessThanOrEqualTo

                                   The value of Name is less than or equal  to
                                   Value  . Not supported for text properties.

       --sort-by (string)
          The name of the resource property used to sort the  SearchResults  .
          The default is LastModifiedTime .

       --sort-order (string)
          How  SearchResults  are  ordered.  Valid  values  are  Ascending  or
          Descending . The default is Descending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                        Provided by Amazon SageMaker: Common Parameters . Ama-
                        zon  SageMaker supports both registry/repository[:tag]
                        and registry/repository[@digest] image  path  formats.

                     AlgorithmName -> (string)
                        The name of the algorithm  resource  to  use  for  the
                        training  job. This must be an algorithm resource that
                        you created or subscribe to  on  Amazon  Web  Services
                        Marketplace.  If  you specify a value for this parame-
                        ter, you can't specify a value for TrainingImage .

                     TrainingInputMode -> (string)
                        The training input mode that the  algorithm  supports.

                        .
                            Pipe mode

                        If an algorithm supports Pipe mode,  Amazon  SageMaker
                        streams data directly from Amazon S3 to the container.
                            File mode

                        If an algorithm supports File  mode,  SageMaker  down-
                        loads  the training data from S3 to the provisioned ML
                        storage volume, and mounts the directory to the Docker
                        volume for the training container.

                        You  must  provision the ML storage volume with suffi-
                        cient capacity to accommodate the data downloaded from
                        S3.  In  addition to the training data, the ML storage
                        volume also stores the  output  model.  The  algorithm
                        container  uses  the  ML  storage volume to also store
                        intermediate information, if any.

                        For distributed algorithms, training data is  distrib-
                        uted  uniformly. Your training duration is predictable
                        if the input data objects sizes are approximately  the
                        same.  SageMaker  does not split the files any further
                        for model training. If the object  sizes  are  skewed,
                        training  won't be optimal as the data distribution is
                        also skewed when one host in  a  training  cluster  is
                        overloaded, thus becoming a bottleneck in training.
                            FastFile mode

                        If  an  algorithm  supports  FastFile  mode, SageMaker
                        streams data directly from S3 to the container with no
                        code  changes,  and provides file system access to the
                        data. Users can author their training script to inter-
                        act with these files as if they were stored on disk.
                            FastFile  mode  works  best  when the data is read
                            sequentially. Augmented manifest files aren't sup-
                            ported.  The  startup time is lower when there are
                            fewer files in the S3 bucket provided.

                     MetricDefinitions -> (list)
                        A list of metric definition objects. Each object spec-
                        ifies  the metric name and regular expressions used to
                        parse algorithm logs. Amazon SageMaker publishes  each
                        metric to Amazon CloudWatch.

                        (structure)
                            Specifies  a  metric  that  the training algorithm
                            writes to stderr or stdout .  Amazon  SageMakerhy-
                            perparameter  tuning captures all defined metrics.
                            You specify one metric that a hyperparameter  tun-
                            ing job uses as its objective metric to choose the
                            best training job.

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the metric.

                            Regex -> (string)
                               A regular expression that searches  the  output
                               of  a  training  job  and gets the value of the
                               metric. For more information about using  regu-
                               lar expressions to define metrics, see Defining
                               Objective Metrics .

                     EnableSageMakerMetricsTimeSeries -> (boolean)
                        To generate and save time-series metrics during train-
                        ing,   set   to  true  .  The  default  is  false  and
                        time-series metrics aren't  generated  except  in  the
                        following cases:

                        o You  use  one of the Amazon SageMaker built-in algo-
                          rithms

                        o You use one of the following Prebuilt  Amazon  Sage-
                          Maker Docker Images :

                          o Tensorflow (version >= 1.15)

                          o MXNet (version >= 1.6)

                          o PyTorch (version >= 1.3)

                        o You specify at least one  MetricDefinition

                 RoleArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Web  Services Identity and Access Management
                     (IAM) role configured for the training job.

                 InputDataConfig -> (list)
                     An array of Channel  objects  that  describes  each  data
                     input channel.

                     (structure)
                        A  channel is a named input source that training algo-
                        rithms can consume.

                        ChannelName -> (string)
                            The name of the channel.

                        DataSource -> (structure)
                            The location of the channel data.

                            S3DataSource -> (structure)
                               The S3 location of  the  data  source  that  is
                               associated with a channel.

                               S3DataType -> (string)
                                   If you choose S3Prefix , S3Uri identifies a
                                   key name prefix. Amazon SageMaker uses  all
                                   objects  that  match the specified key name
                                   prefix for model training.

                                   If you choose ManifestFile , S3Uri  identi-
                                   fies an object that is a manifest file con-
                                   taining a list of object keys that you want
                                   Amazon SageMaker to use for model training.

                                   If you choose AugmentedManifestFile , S3Uri
                                   identifies  an  object that is an augmented
                                   manifest file in JSON  lines  format.  This
                                   file  contains the data you want to use for
                                   model training.  AugmentedManifestFile  can
                                   only be used if the Channel's input mode is
                                   Pipe .

                               S3Uri -> (string)
                                   Depending on the value  specified  for  the
                                   S3DataType  ,  identifies either a key name
                                   prefix or a manifest. For example:

                                   o A key name prefix might look  like  this:
                                     s3://bucketname/exampleprefix

                                   o A   manifest   might   look   like  this:
                                     s3://bucketname/example.manifest   A man-
                                     ifest  is  an  S3  object which is a JSON
                                     file consisting of an array of  elements.
                                     The  first  element  is a prefix which is
                                     followed by one or more  suffixes.  Sage-
                                     Maker  appends the suffix elements to the
                                     prefix to get a full set of S3Uri .  Note
                                     that the prefix must be a valid non-empty
                                     S3Uri that precludes users from  specify-
                                     ing  a manifest whose individual S3Uri is
                                     sourced from different  S3  buckets.  The
                                     following code example shows a valid man-
                                     ifest format:   [  {"prefix":  "s3://cus-

                                     equivalent  to  the following S3Uri list:

                                     of S3Uri in this manifest  is  the  input
                                     data   for  the  channel  for  this  data
                                     source. The object that each S3Uri points
                                     to  must be readable by the IAM role that
                                     Amazon SageMaker uses to perform tasks on
                                     your behalf.

                               S3DataDistributionType -> (string)
                                   If  you  want Amazon SageMaker to replicate
                                   the  entire  dataset  on  each  ML  compute
                                   instance  that is launched for model train-
                                   ing, specify FullyReplicated .

                                   If you want Amazon SageMaker to replicate a
                                   subset  of data on each ML compute instance
                                   that is launched for model training,  spec-
                                   ify ShardedByS3Key . If there are n ML com-
                                   pute instances launched for a training job,
                                   each instance gets approximately 1/n of the
                                   number of S3 objects. In this  case,  model
                                   training on each machine uses only the sub-
                                   set of training data.

                                   Don't choose more ML compute instances  for
                                   training  than available S3 objects. If you
                                   do, some nodes won't get any data  and  you
                                   will  pay for nodes that aren't getting any
                                   training data. This applies  in  both  File
                                   and  Pipe  modes.  Keep  this  in mind when
                                   developing algorithms.

                                   In distributed training, where you use mul-
                                   tiple  ML  compute EC2 instances, you might
                                   choose ShardedByS3Key .  If  the  algorithm
                                   requires  copying  training  data to the ML
                                   storage volume (when  TrainingInputMode  is
                                   set  to File ), this copies 1/n of the num-
                                   ber of objects.

                               AttributeNames -> (list)
                                   A list of one or more  attribute  names  to
                                   use that are found in a specified augmented
                                   manifest file.

                                   (string)

                            FileSystemDataSource -> (structure)
                               The file system that is associated with a chan-
                               nel.

                               FileSystemId -> (string)
                                   The file system id.

                               FileSystemAccessMode -> (string)
                                   The  access mode of the mount of the direc-
                                   tory associated with the channel. A  direc-
                                   tory   can   be   mounted   either   in  ro
                                   (read-only) or rw (read-write) mode.

                               FileSystemType -> (string)
                                   The file system type.

                               DirectoryPath -> (string)
                                   The full path to the directory to associate
                                   with the channel.

                        ContentType -> (string)
                            The MIME type of the data.

                        CompressionType -> (string)
                            If  training  data  is compressed, the compression
                            type. The default value is None .  CompressionType
                            is  used  only  in  Pipe input mode. In File mode,
                            leave this field unset or set it to None.

                        RecordWrapperType -> (string)
                            Specify RecordIO as the value when input  data  is
                            in  raw format but the training algorithm requires
                            the RecordIO format. In this  case,  Amazon  Sage-
                            Maker  wraps each individual S3 object in a Recor-
                            dIO record. If the input data is already in Recor-
                            dIO  format, you don't need to set this attribute.

                            RecordIO .

                            In  File mode, leave this field unset or set it to
                            None.

                        InputMode -> (string)
                            (Optional) The input mode  to  use  for  the  data
                            channel  in  a  training  job.  If you don't set a
                            value for InputMode , Amazon  SageMaker  uses  the
                            value set for TrainingInputMode . Use this parame-

                            to the container, choose Pipe input mode.

                            File input model.

                        ShuffleConfig -> (structure)
                            A  configuration  for  a  shuffle option for input
                            data  in  a  channel.  If  you  use  S3Prefix  for
                            S3DataType  ,  this shuffles the results of the S3
                            key prefix matches. If you use ManifestFile ,  the
                            order of the S3 object references in the Manifest-
                            File is shuffled. If you use AugmentedManifestFile
                            , the order of the JSON lines in the AugmentedMan-
                            ifestFile is  shuffled.  The  shuffling  order  is
                            determined using the Seed value.

                            For  Pipe  input  mode,  shuffling  is done at the
                            start of every epoch.  With  large  datasets  this
                            ensures  that  the  order  of the training data is
                            different for each epoch, it helps reduce bias and
                            possible overfitting. In a multi-node training job
                            when ShuffleConfig is combined with  S3DataDistri-
                            butionType  of  ShardedByS3Key , the data is shuf-
                            fled across nodes so that the content  sent  to  a
                            particular  node  on the first epoch might be sent
                            to a different node on the second epoch.

                            Seed -> (long)
                               Determines the shuffling order in ShuffleConfig
                               value.

                 OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
                     The  S3  path  where  model artifacts that you configured
                     when creating the job are stored. Amazon  SageMaker  cre-
                     ates subfolders for model artifacts.

                     KmsKeyId -> (string)
                        The Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon
                        Web Services KMS) key that Amazon  SageMaker  uses  to
                        encrypt  the  model  artifacts at rest using Amazon S3
                        server-side encryption. The KmsKeyId can be any of the
                        following formats:

                        o //              KMS              Key              ID
                          "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                        o //  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  a   KMS   Key
                          "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                        o // KMS Key Alias  "alias/ExampleAlias"

                        o // Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  a  KMS  Key  Alias
                          "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/Exam-
                          pleAlias"

                        If you use a KMS key ID or an alias of your  KMS  key,
                        the  Amazon SageMaker execution role must include per-
                        missions to call kms:Encrypt . If you don't provide  a
                        KMS  key ID, Amazon SageMaker uses the default KMS key
                        for Amazon S3 for your role's  account.  Amazon  Sage-
                        Maker  uses  server-side  encryption  with KMS-managed
                        keys for OutputDataConfig . If you use a bucket policy
                        with  an  s3:PutObject  permission  that  only  allows
                        objects with server-side encryption, set the condition
                        key  of s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption to "aws:kms" .
                        For more information, see KMS-Managed Encryption  Keys
                        in  the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.

                        The KMS key policy must grant permission  to  the  IAM
                        role that you specify in your CreateTrainingJob , Cre-
                        ateTransformJob  ,  or   CreateHyperParameterTuningJob
                        requests. For more information, see Using Key Policies
                        in Amazon Web Services KMS in the Amazon Web  Services
                        Key Management Service Developer Guide .

                     S3OutputPath -> (string)
                        Identifies the S3 path where you want Amazon SageMaker
                        to   store   the   model   artifacts.   For   example,
                        s3://bucket-name/key-name-prefix .

                 ResourceConfig -> (structure)
                     Resources,  including ML compute instances and ML storage
                     volumes, that are configured for model training.

                     InstanceType -> (string)
                        The ML compute instance type.

                     InstanceCount -> (integer)
                        The number of ML compute instances to  use.  For  dis-
                        tributed training, provide a value greater than 1.

                     VolumeSizeInGB -> (integer)
                        The  size  of  the  ML storage volume that you want to
                        provision.

                        ML storage volumes store model artifacts and incremen-
                        tal  states. Training algorithms might also use the ML
                        storage volume for scratch space. If you want to store
                        the  training  data  in  the ML storage volume, choose
                        File as the TrainingInputMode in the algorithm  speci-
                        fication.

                        You  must  specify sufficient ML storage for your sce-
                        nario.

                        NOTE:
                            Amazon SageMaker supports only the General Purpose
                            SSD (gp2) ML storage volume type.

                        NOTE:
                            Certain  Nitro-based instances include local stor-
                            age with a fixed  total  size,  dependent  on  the
                            instance  type.  When  using  these  instances for
                            training,  Amazon  SageMaker  mounts   the   local
                            instance  storage  instead of Amazon EBS gp2 stor-
                            age. You can't request  a  VolumeSizeInGB  greater
                            than the total size of the local instance storage.

                            For a list of instance types  that  support  local
                            instance  storage,  including  the  total size per
                            instance type, see Instance Store Volumes .

                     VolumeKmsKeyId -> (string)
                        The Amazon Web Services KMS key that Amazon  SageMaker
                        uses to encrypt data on the storage volume attached to
                        the ML compute instance(s) that run the training  job.

                        NOTE:
                            Certain  Nitro-based instances include local stor-
                            age, dependent on the instance type. Local storage
                            volumes  are  encrypted using a hardware module on
                            the instance. You can't request  a  VolumeKmsKeyId
                            when using an instance type with local storage.

                            For  a  list  of instance types that support local
                            instance storage, see Instance Store Volumes .

                            For more information about local instance  storage
                            encryption, see SSD Instance Store Volumes .

                        The VolumeKmsKeyId can be in any of the following for-
                        mats:

                        o //              KMS              Key              ID
                          "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                        o //   Amazon   Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  a  KMS  Key
                          "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                 VpcConfig -> (structure)
                     A   VpcConfig  object  that  specifies  the VPC that this
                     training job has access to.  For  more  information,  see
                     Protect  Training Jobs by Using an Amazon Virtual Private
                     Cloud .

                     SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                        The VPC security group IDs, in the  form  sg-xxxxxxxx.
                        Specify the security groups for the VPC that is speci-
                        fied in the Subnets field.

                        (string)

                     Subnets -> (list)
                        The ID of the subnets in the VPC to which you want  to
                        connect  your  training  job or model. For information
                        about the availability of specific instance types, see
                        Supported Instance Types and Availability Zones .

                        (string)

                 StoppingCondition -> (structure)
                     Specifies  a  limit  to how long a model training job can
                     run. It also specifies how long a managed  Spot  training
                     job has to complete. When the job reaches the time limit,
                     Amazon SageMaker ends the training job. Use this  API  to
                     cap model training costs.

                     To  stop  a job, Amazon SageMaker sends the algorithm the
                     SIGTERM signal, which delays job termination for 120 sec-
                     onds.  Algorithms  can use this 120-second window to save
                     the model artifacts, so the results of training  are  not
                     lost.

                     MaxRuntimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                        The  maximum length of time, in seconds, that a train-
                        ing or compilation job can run.

                        For compilation jobs, if the  job  does  not  complete
                        during this time, you will receive a TimeOut error. We
                        recommend starting with 900 seconds  and  increase  as
                        necessary based on your model.

                        For  all other jobs, if the job does not complete dur-
                        ing this time, Amazon SageMaker  ends  the  job.  When
                        RetryStrategy is specified in the job request, MaxRun-
                        timeInSeconds specifies the maximum time  for  all  of
                        the  attempts  in  total, not each individual attempt.
                        The default value is 1 day. The maximum  value  is  28
                        days.

                     MaxWaitTimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                        The maximum length of time, in seconds, that a managed
                        Spot training job has to complete. It is the amount of
                        time  spent  waiting for Spot capacity plus the amount
                        of time the job can  run.  It  must  be  equal  to  or
                        greater than MaxRuntimeInSeconds . If the job does not
                        complete during this time, Amazon SageMaker  ends  the
                        job.

                        When  RetryStrategy  is  specified in the job request,
                        MaxWaitTimeInSeconds specifies the  maximum  time  for
                        all  of  the  attempts  in  total, not each individual
                        attempt.

                 CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                     A timestamp that indicates when the training job was cre-
                     ated.

                 TrainingStartTime -> (timestamp)
                     Indicates the time when the training job starts on train-
                     ing instances. You  are  billed  for  the  time  interval
                     between  this time and the value of TrainingEndTime . The
                     start time in CloudWatch Logs might be  later  than  this
                     time. The difference is due to the time it takes to down-
                     load the training data and to the size  of  the  training
                     container.

                 TrainingEndTime -> (timestamp)
                     Indicates the time when the training job ends on training
                     instances. You are billed for the time  interval  between
                     the  value  of  TrainingStartTime and this time. For suc-
                     cessful jobs and stopped jobs, this  is  the  time  after
                     model  artifacts  are  uploaded. For failed jobs, this is
                     the time when Amazon SageMaker detects a job failure.

                 LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                     A timestamp that indicates when the status of the  train-
                     ing job was last modified.

                 SecondaryStatusTransitions -> (list)
                     A  history  of  all  of  the  secondary statuses that the
                     training job has transitioned through.

                     (structure)
                        An array element of   DescribeTrainingJobResponse$Sec-
                        ondaryStatusTransitions   .   It  provides  additional
                        details about a status that the training job has tran-
                        sitioned through. A training job can be in one of sev-
                        eral  states,  for  example,  starting,   downloading,
                        training, or uploading. Within each state, there are a
                        number of intermediate states. For example, within the
                        starting state, Amazon SageMaker could be starting the
                        training job or  launching  the  ML  instances.  These
                        transitional  states are referred to as the job's sec-
                        ondary status.

                        Status -> (string)
                            Contains a secondary  status  information  from  a
                            training job.

                            Status  might  be  one  of the following secondary
                            statuses:
                               InProgress

                            o Starting - Starting the training job.

                            o Downloading - An optional stage  for  algorithms
                              that  support File training input mode. It indi-
                              cates that data is being downloaded  to  the  ML
                              storage volumes.

                               The  name  of the algorithm resource to use for
                               the training job. This  must  be  an  algorithm
                               resource  that  you  created or subscribe to on
                               Amazon Web Services Marketplace. If you specify
                               a value for this parameter, you can't specify a
                               value for TrainingImage .

                            TrainingInputMode -> (string)
                               The training input mode that the algorithm sup-
                               ports.  For more information about input modes,
                               see Algorithms .
                                   Pipe mode

                               If an  algorithm  supports  Pipe  mode,  Amazon
                               SageMaker  streams data directly from Amazon S3
                               to the container.
                                   File mode

                               If an algorithm supports File  mode,  SageMaker
                               downloads the training data from S3 to the pro-
                               visioned ML  storage  volume,  and  mounts  the
                               directory to the Docker volume for the training
                               container.

                               You must provision the ML storage  volume  with
                               sufficient  capacity  to  accommodate  the data
                               downloaded from S3. In addition to the training
                               data,  the  ML  storage  volume also stores the
                               output model. The algorithm container uses  the
                               ML  storage  volume  to also store intermediate
                               information, if any.

                               For distributed algorithms,  training  data  is
                               distributed  uniformly.  Your training duration
                               is predictable if the input data objects  sizes
                               are  approximately the same. SageMaker does not
                               split the files any further for model training.
                               If  the object sizes are skewed, training won't
                               be optimal as the  data  distribution  is  also
                               skewed  when  one host in a training cluster is
                               overloaded,  thus  becoming  a  bottleneck   in
                               training.
                                   FastFile mode

                               If  an  algorithm supports FastFile mode, Sage-
                               Maker streams data directly from S3 to the con-
                               tainer  with no code changes, and provides file
                               system access to the  data.  Users  can  author
                               their  training  script  to interact with these
                               files as if they were stored on disk.
                                   FastFile mode works best when the  data  is
                                   read sequentially. Augmented manifest files
                                   aren't supported. The startup time is lower
                                   when there are fewer files in the S3 bucket
                                   provided.

                               expressions used to parse algorithm logs.  Ama-
                               zon  SageMaker  publishes each metric to Amazon

                                   that a hyperparameter tuning  job  uses  as
                                   its  objective  metric  to  choose the best
                                   training job.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the metric.

                                   Regex -> (string)
                                      A regular expression that  searches  the
                                      output  of  a  training job and gets the
                                      value of the metric. For  more  informa-

                            EnableSageMakerMetricsTimeSeries -> (boolean)
                               To generate and save time-series metrics during
                               training, set to true . The  default  is  false
                               and time-series metrics aren't generated except
                               in the following cases:

                        RoleArn -> (string)
                            The Amazon Web Services Identity and  Access  Man-
                            agement  (IAM)  role  configured  for the training
                            job.

                        InputDataConfig -> (list)
                            An array of Channel objects  that  describes  each
                            data input channel.

                            (structure)
                               A channel is a named input source that training
                               algorithms can consume.

                               ChannelName -> (string)
                                   The name of the channel.

                               DataSource -> (structure)
                                   The location of the channel data.

                                   S3DataSource -> (structure)
                                      The S3 location of the data source  that
                                      is associated with a channel.

                                      S3DataType -> (string)
                                          If you choose S3Prefix , S3Uri iden-
                                          tifies a  key  name  prefix.  Amazon
                                          SageMaker   uses  all  objects  that
                                          match the specified key name  prefix
                                          for model training.

                                          If  you  choose ManifestFile , S3Uri
                                          identifies an object that is a mani-
                                          fest   file  containing  a  list  of
                                          object keys  that  you  want  Amazon
                                          SageMaker to use for model training.

                                          If you choose  AugmentedManifestFile
                                          , S3Uri identifies an object that is
                                          an augmented manifest file  in  JSON
                                          lines format. This file contains the
                                          data  you  want  to  use  for  model
                                          training.  AugmentedManifestFile can
                                          only be used if the Channel's  input
                                          mode is Pipe .

                                      S3Uri -> (string)
                                          Depending on the value specified for
                                          the S3DataType , identifies either a
                                          key  name  prefix or a manifest. For
                                          example:

                                          o A key name prefix might look  like
                                            this:  s3://bucketname/examplepre-
                                            fix

                                          o A manifest might look  like  this:
                                            s3://bucketname/example.manifest
                                            A manifest is an S3  object  which
                                            is  a  JSON  file consisting of an
                                            array of elements. The first  ele-
                                            ment is a prefix which is followed
                                            by one or more suffixes. SageMaker
                                            appends the suffix elements to the
                                            prefix to get a full set of  S3Uri
                                            .  Note  that the prefix must be a
                                            valid non-empty  S3Uri  that  pre-
                                            cludes  users  from  specifying  a
                                            manifest whose individual S3Uri is
                                            sourced from different S3 buckets.
                                            The following code example shows a
                                            valid  manifest format:   [ {"pre-
                                            fix":                   "s3://cus-

                                            "relative/path/custdata-N"       ]
                                            This  JSON  is  equivalent  to the

                                          objects. In this case, model  train-
                                          ing  on  each  machine uses only the

                               CompressionType -> (string)
                                   If  training  data  is compressed, the com-
                                   pression type. The default value is None  .
                                   CompressionType  is used only in Pipe input
                                   mode. In File mode, leave this field  unset
                                   or set it to None.

                               RecordWrapperType -> (string)
                                   Specify  RecordIO  as  the value when input
                                   data is in  raw  format  but  the  training
                                   algorithm  requires the RecordIO format. In
                                   this  case,  Amazon  SageMaker  wraps  each
                                   individual  S3 object in a RecordIO record.
                                   If the input data is  already  in  RecordIO
                                   format,   you   don't   need  to  set  this
                                   attribute. For more information, see Create
                                   a Dataset Using RecordIO .

                                   In File mode, leave this field unset or set
                                   it to None.

                               InputMode -> (string)
                                   (Optional) The input mode to  use  for  the
                                   data  channel  in  a  training  job. If you
                                   don't set a value for  InputMode  ,  Amazon
                                   SageMaker  uses the value set for Training-
                                   InputMode . Use this parameter to  override
                                   the  TrainingInputMode  setting in a  Algo-
                                   rithmSpecification request when you have  a
                                   channel  that  needs a different input mode
                                   from the training job's general setting. To
                                   download  the data from Amazon Simple Stor-
                                   age Service (Amazon S3) to the  provisioned
                                   ML  storage volume, and mount the directory
                                   to a Docker volume, use File input mode. To
                                   stream  data directly from Amazon S3 to the
                                   container, choose Pipe input mode.

                                   To use a model  for  incremental  training,
                                   choose File input model.

                               ShuffleConfig -> (structure)
                                   A  configuration  for  a shuffle option for
                                   input data in a channel. If you use  S3Pre-
                                   fix  for  S3DataType  ,  this  shuffles the
                                   results of the S3 key  prefix  matches.  If
                                   you  use ManifestFile , the order of the S3
                                   object references in  the  ManifestFile  is
                                   shuffled.  If you use AugmentedManifestFile
                                   , the order of the JSON lines in  the  Aug-
                                   mentedManifestFile  is  shuffled. The shuf-
                                   fling order is determined  using  the  Seed
                                   value.

                                   For  Pipe  input mode, shuffling is done at
                                   the  start  of  every  epoch.  With   large
                                   datasets this ensures that the order of the
                                   training data is different for each  epoch,
                                   it  helps reduce bias and possible overfit-
                                   ting. In a  multi-node  training  job  when
                                   ShuffleConfig  is  combined with S3DataDis-
                                   tributionType of ShardedByS3Key , the  data
                                   is  shuffled  across nodes so that the con-
                                   tent sent to a particular node on the first
                                   epoch  might be sent to a different node on
                                   the second epoch.

                                   Seed -> (long)

                        OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
                            The S3 path where model artifacts that you config-
                            ured when creating  the  job  are  stored.  Amazon
                            SageMaker  creates subfolders for model artifacts.

                            KmsKeyId -> (string)
                               The Amazon Web Services Key Management  Service
                               (Amazon Web Services KMS) key that Amazon Sage-
                               Maker uses to encrypt the  model  artifacts  at
                               rest  using  Amazon  S3 server-side encryption.
                               The KmsKeyId can be any of the  following  for-
                               mats:

                               o //            KMS            Key           ID
                                 "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                               o // Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  a  KMS  Key
                                 "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                               o // KMS Key Alias  "alias/ExampleAlias"

                               o // Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  a  KMS  Key

                               If you use a KMS key ID or an alias of your KMS
                               key, the Amazon SageMaker execution  role  must
                               include  permissions  to  call kms:Encrypt . If
                               you don't provide a KMS key  ID,  Amazon  Sage-
                               Maker  uses  the  default KMS key for Amazon S3
                               for your role's account. Amazon SageMaker  uses
                               server-side  encryption  with  KMS-managed keys
                               for OutputDataConfig . If you use a bucket pol-
                               icy  with  an s3:PutObject permission that only
                               allows objects with server-side encryption, set
                               the          condition          key          of
                               s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption to "aws:kms"  .

                            S3OutputPath -> (string)
                               Identifies  the  S3  path where you want Amazon
                               SageMaker to store  the  model  artifacts.  For
                               example, s3://bucket-name/key-name-prefix .

                        ResourceConfig -> (structure)
                            Resources,  including  ML compute instances and ML
                            storage volumes, that  are  configured  for  model
                            training.

                            InstanceType -> (string)
                               The ML compute instance type.

                            InstanceCount -> (integer)
                               The  number of ML compute instances to use. For
                               distributed training, provide a  value  greater
                               than 1.

                            VolumeSizeInGB -> (integer)
                               The size of the ML storage volume that you want
                               to provision.

                               ML storage volumes store  model  artifacts  and
                               incremental  states.  Training algorithms might
                               also use the  ML  storage  volume  for  scratch
                               space.  If  you want to store the training data
                               in the ML storage volume, choose  File  as  the
                               TrainingInputMode  in  the algorithm specifica-
                               tion.

                               You must specify sufficient ML storage for your
                               scenario.

                               NOTE:
                                   Amazon  SageMaker supports only the General
                                   Purpose SSD (gp2) ML storage volume type.

                               NOTE:
                                   Certain Nitro-based instances include local
                                   storage  with a fixed total size, dependent
                                   on the  instance  type.  When  using  these
                                   instances  for  training,  Amazon SageMaker
                                   mounts the local instance  storage  instead
                                   of   Amazon  EBS  gp2  storage.  You  can't
                                   request a VolumeSizeInGB greater  than  the
                                   total size of the local instance storage.

                            VolumeKmsKeyId -> (string)
                               The Amazon Web Services  KMS  key  that  Amazon
                               SageMaker  uses  to encrypt data on the storage
                               volume attached to the ML  compute  instance(s)
                               that run the training job.

                               NOTE:
                                   Certain Nitro-based instances include local
                                   storage, dependent on  the  instance  type.
                                   Local storage volumes are encrypted using a
                                   hardware module on the instance. You  can't
                                   request  a  VolumeKmsKeyId  when  using  an
                                   instance type with local storage.

                               The ID of the subnets in the VPC to  which  you
                               want to connect your training job or model. For
                               information about the availability of  specific
                               instance  types,  see  Supported Instance Types
                               and Availability Zones .

                               (string)

                        StoppingCondition -> (structure)
                            Specifies a limit to how long a model training job
                            can run. It also specifies how long a managed Spot
                            training job has to complete. When the job reaches
                            the time limit, Amazon SageMaker ends the training
                            job. Use this API to cap model training costs.

                            To stop a job, Amazon SageMaker  sends  the  algo-
                            rithm  the SIGTERM signal, which delays job termi-
                            nation for 120 seconds. Algorithms  can  use  this
                            120-second  window to save the model artifacts, so
                            the results of training are not lost.

                            MaxRuntimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                               The maximum length of time, in seconds, that  a
                               training or compilation job can run.

                               For  compilation jobs, if the job does not com-
                               plete during this  time,  you  will  receive  a
                               TimeOut  error.  We recommend starting with 900
                               seconds and increase as necessary based on your
                               model.

                               For  all  other  jobs, if the job does not com-
                               plete during this time, Amazon  SageMaker  ends
                               the job. When RetryStrategy is specified in the
                               job request, MaxRuntimeInSeconds specifies  the
                               maximum  time for all of the attempts in total,
                               not each individual attempt. The default  value
                               is 1 day. The maximum value is 28 days.

                            MaxWaitTimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                               The  maximum length of time, in seconds, that a
                               managed Spot training job has to  complete.  It
                               is  the  amount  of time spent waiting for Spot
                               capacity plus the amount of time  the  job  can
                               run.  It  must  be  equal  to  or  greater than
                               MaxRuntimeInSeconds . If the job does not  com-
                               plete  during  this time, Amazon SageMaker ends
                               the job.

                               When RetryStrategy  is  specified  in  the  job
                               request,   MaxWaitTimeInSeconds  specifies  the
                               maximum time for all of the attempts in  total,
                               not each individual attempt.

                        CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                            A  timestamp  that indicates when the training job
                            was created.

                        TrainingStartTime -> (timestamp)
                            Indicates the time when the training job starts on
                            training  instances.  You  are billed for the time
                            interval between this time and the value of Train-
                            ingEndTime  .  The  start  time in CloudWatch Logs
                            might be later than this time. The  difference  is
                            due  to the time it takes to download the training
                            data and to the size of the training container.

                        TrainingEndTime -> (timestamp)
                            Indicates the time when the training job  ends  on
                            training  instances.  You  are billed for the time
                            interval between the  value  of  TrainingStartTime
                            and  this  time.  For  successful jobs and stopped
                            jobs, this is the time after model  artifacts  are
                            uploaded.  For  failed jobs, this is the time when
                            Amazon SageMaker detects a job failure.

                        LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                            A timestamp that indicates when the status of  the
                            training job was last modified.

                        SecondaryStatusTransitions -> (list)
                            A  history  of  all of the secondary statuses that
                            the training job has transitioned through.

                            (structure)
                               An  array  element  of   DescribeTrainingJobRe-
                               sponse$SecondaryStatusTransitions . It provides
                               additional details  about  a  status  that  the
                               training job has transitioned through. A train-
                               ing job can be in one of  several  states,  for
                               example,  starting,  downloading,  training, or
                               uploading. Within each state, there are a  num-
                               ber of intermediate states. For example, within
                               the starting state, Amazon SageMaker  could  be
                               starting  the  training job or launching the ML
                               instances.  These   transitional   states   are
                               referred to as the job's secondary status.

                               Status -> (string)
                                   Contains  a  secondary  status  information
                                   from a training job.

                                   Status might be one of the  following  sec-
                                   ondary statuses:

                               StartTime -> (timestamp)
                                   A  timestamp  that  shows when the training
                                   job transitioned to the  current  secondary
                                   status state.

                               EndTime -> (timestamp)
                                   A  timestamp  that  shows when the training
                                   job transitioned out of this secondary sta-
                                   tus  state  into  another  secondary status
                                   state or when the training job has ended.

                               StatusMessage -> (string)
                                   A  detailed  description  of  the  progress
                                   within a secondary status.

                        FinalMetricDataList -> (list)
                            A list of final metric values that  are  set  when
                            the  training  job  completes.  Used  only  if the
                            training job was configured to use metrics.

                            (structure)
                               The name, value, and date and time of a  metric
                               that was emitted to Amazon CloudWatch.

                               MetricName -> (string)
                                   The name of the metric.

                               Value -> (float)

                                      data  to.  LocalPath is an absolute path
                                      to the input data and  must  begin  with
                                      /opt/ml/processing/  .  LocalPath  is  a
                                      required parameter  when  AppManaged  is
                                      False (default).

                                   S3DataType -> (string)
                                      Whether  you  use an S3Prefix or a Mani-
                                      festFile  for  the  data  type.  If  you
                                      choose S3Prefix , S3Uri identifies a key
                                      name prefix. Amazon SageMaker  uses  all
                                      objects with the specified key name pre-
                                      fix  for  the  processing  job.  If  you
                                      choose  ManifestFile  , S3Uri identifies
                                      an object that is a manifest  file  con-
                                      taining  a  list of object keys that you
                                      want Amazon SageMaker  to  use  for  the
                                      processing job.

                                      Whether  to use File or Pipe input mode.
                                      In File mode,  Amazon  SageMaker  copies
                                      the  data from the input source onto the
                                      local ML storage volume before  starting
                                      your  processing  container. This is the
                                      most commonly used input mode.  In  Pipe
                                      mode,  Amazon  SageMaker  streams  input
                                      data from the source  directly  to  your
                                      processing  container  into  named pipes
                                      without using the ML storage volume.

                                      FullyReplicated , or  whether  the  data
                                      from  Amazon  S3  is shared by Amazon S3
                                      key, downloading one shard  of  data  to
                                      each processing instance.

                                      processing  container.  Gzip can only be
                                      used when Pipe mode is specified as  the
                                      S3InputMode . In Pipe mode, Amazon Sage-
                                      Maker streams input data from the source
                                      directly to your container without using
                                      the EBS volume.

                                      dependent  on  the  instance  type. When
                                      using these  instances  for  processing,
                                      Amazon   SageMaker   mounts   the  local
                                      instance storage instead of  Amazon  EBS
                                      gp2 storage. You can't request a Volume-
                                      SizeInGB greater than the total size  of
                                      the local instance storage.

                                   Amazon SageMaker uses to  encrypt  data  on
                                   the  storage volume attached to the ML com-
                                   pute instance(s) that  run  the  processing
                                   job.

                                      Certain  Nitro-based  instances  include
                                      local storage, dependent on the instance
                                      type.    Local   storage   volumes   are
                                      encrypted using a hardware module on the
                                      instance.   You  can't  request  a  Vol-

                               A  tag  object  that  consists  of a key and an
                               optional value, used  to  manage  metadata  for
                               SageMaker Amazon Web Services resources.

                               You  can add tags to notebook instances, train-
                               ing jobs,  hyperparameter  tuning  jobs,  batch
                               transform  jobs,  models,  labeling  jobs, work
                               teams, endpoint configurations, and  endpoints.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The  tag  key.  Tag keys must be unique per
                                   resource.

                               Value -> (string)
                                   The tag value.

                     TransformJob -> (structure)
                        Information about a transform job that's the source of
                        a trial component.

                        TransformJobName -> (string)
                            The name of the transform job.

                        TransformJobArn -> (string)
                            The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the transform
                            job.

                        TransformJobStatus -> (string)
                            The status of the transform job.

                            Transform job statuses are:

                            o InProgress - The job is in progress.

                            o Completed - The job has completed.

                            o Failed - The transform job has  failed.  To  see
                              the  reason for the failure, see the FailureRea-
                              son field in the response to a DescribeTransfor-
                              mJob call.

                            o Stopping - The transform job is stopping.

                            o Stopped - The transform job has stopped.

                        FailureReason -> (string)
                            If the transform job failed, the reason it failed.

                        ModelName -> (string)
                            The name of the model associated with  the  trans-
                            form job.

                        MaxConcurrentTransforms -> (integer)
                            The  maximum  number of parallel requests that can
                            be sent to each instance in a  transform  job.  If
                            MaxConcurrentTransforms is set to 0 or left unset,
                            SageMaker checks the optional execution-parameters
                            to  determine  the  settings for your chosen algo-
                            rithm. If the execution-parameters endpoint is not
                            enabled,  the  default  value  is  1. For built-in
                            algorithms, you don't need to set a value for Max-
                            ConcurrentTransforms .

                        ModelClientConfig -> (structure)
                            Configures  the  timeout  and  maximum  number  of
                            retries for processing a transform job invocation.

                            InvocationsTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
                               The  timeout value in seconds for an invocation
                               request.

                            InvocationsMaxRetries -> (integer)
                               The maximum number of retries  when  invocation
                               requests are failing.

                        MaxPayloadInMB -> (integer)
                            The  maximum allowed size of the payload, in MB. A
                            payload is the data portion of a  record  (without
                            metadata).  The  value  in  MaxPayloadInMB must be
                            greater than, or equal to, the size  of  a  single
                            record.  To  estimate  the size of a record in MB,
                            divide the size of your dataset by the  number  of
                            records. To ensure that the records fit within the
                            maximum  payload  size,  we  recommend   using   a
                            slightly  larger value. The default value is 6 MB.
                            For cases where the payload might  be  arbitrarily
                            large and is transmitted using HTTP chunked encod-
                            ing, set the value to 0. This feature  works  only
                            in   supported  algorithms.  Currently,  SageMaker
                            built-in algorithms do not  support  HTTP  chunked
                            encoding.

                        BatchStrategy -> (string)
                            Specifies  the  number  of records to include in a
                            mini-batch for an HTTP inference request. A record
                            is  a single unit of input data that inference can
                            be made on. For example, a single line  in  a  CSV
                            file is a record.

                        Environment -> (map)
                            The  environment  variables  to  set in the Docker
                            container. We support up  to  16  key  and  values
                            entries in the map.

                            key -> (string)

                            value -> (string)

                        TransformInput -> (structure)
                            Describes  the input source of a transform job and
                            the way the transform job consumes it.

                            DataSource -> (structure)
                               Describes the location  of  the  channel  data,
                               which  is,  the  S3  location of the input data
                               that the model can consume.

                               S3DataSource -> (structure)
                                   The S3 location of the data source that  is
                                   associated with a channel.

                                   S3DataType -> (string)
                                      If  you  choose S3Prefix , S3Uri identi-
                                      fies a key name prefix. Amazon SageMaker
                                      uses  all objects with the specified key
                                      name prefix for batch transform.

                                      If you choose ManifestFile , S3Uri iden-
                                      tifies an object that is a manifest file
                                      containing a list of  object  keys  that
                                      you  want  Amazon  SageMaker  to use for
                                      batch transform.

                                      The  following  values  are  compatible:
                                      ManifestFile , S3Prefix

                                      The  following  value is not compatible:
                                      AugmentedManifestFile

                                   S3Uri -> (string)
                                      Depending on the value specified for the
                                      S3DataType  ,  identifies  either  a key
                                      name prefix or a manifest. For example:

                                      o A key  name  prefix  might  look  like
                                        this:  s3://bucketname/exampleprefix .

                                      o A  manifest  might  look  like   this:
                                        s3://bucketname/example.manifest   The
                                        manifest is an S3 object  which  is  a
                                        JSON  file  with the following format:
                                        [        {"prefix":         "s3://cus-

                                        S3Uris          :            s3://cus-

                                        tive/path/custdata-N    The   complete
                                        set of S3Uris in this manifest consti-
                                        tutes the input data for  the  channel
                                        for  this  datasource. The object that
                                        each S3Uris points to must be readable
                                        by  the IAM role that Amazon SageMaker
                                        uses to perform tasks on your  behalf.

                            ContentType -> (string)
                               The multipurpose internet mail extension (MIME)
                               type of the data.  Amazon  SageMaker  uses  the
                               MIME  type with each http call to transfer data
                               to the transform job.

                            CompressionType -> (string)
                               If your transform data is  compressed,  specify
                               the compression type. Amazon SageMaker automat-
                               ically decompresses the data for the  transform
                               job accordingly. The default value is None .

                            SplitType -> (string)
                               The  method to use to split the transform job's
                               data files into smaller batches.  Splitting  is
                               necessary when the total size of each object is
                               too large to fit in a single request.  You  can
                               also  use data splitting to improve performance
                               by processing multiple concurrent mini-batches.
                               The default value for SplitType is None , which
                               indicates that input data files are not  split,
                               and  request  payloads  contain the entire con-
                               tents of an input object. Set the value of this
                               parameter to Line to split records on a newline
                               character boundary. SplitType also  supports  a
                               number  of record-oriented binary data formats.
                               Currently, the supported record formats are:

                               o RecordIO

                               o TFRecord

                               When  splitting  is  enabled,  the  size  of  a
                               mini-batch  depends on the values of the Batch-
                               Strategy and  MaxPayloadInMB  parameters.  When
                               the  value  of  BatchStrategy  is MultiRecord ,
                               Amazon SageMaker sends the  maximum  number  of
                               records  in each request, up to the MaxPayload-
                               InMB limit. If the value  of  BatchStrategy  is
                               SingleRecord  , Amazon SageMaker sends individ-
                               ual records in each request.

                               NOTE:
                                   Some data formats represent a record  as  a
                                   binary  payload  wrapped with extra padding
                                   bytes.  When  splitting  is  applied  to  a
                                   binary  data  format, padding is removed if
                                   the value of BatchStrategy is set  to  Sin-
                                   gleRecord  .  Padding is not removed if the

                        TransformOutput -> (structure)
                            Describes the results of a transform job.

                            S3OutputPath -> (string)
                               The  Amazon S3 path where you want Amazon Sage-
                               Maker to store the  results  of  the  transform
                               job.                For                example,
                               s3://bucket-name/key-name-prefix .

                               For every S3  object  used  as  input  for  the
                               transform   job,  batch  transform  stores  the
                               transformed data with an .``out`` suffix  in  a
                               corresponding  subfolder in the location in the
                               output prefix. For example, for the input  data
                               stored    at   s3://bucket-name/input-name-pre-
                               fix/dataset01/data.csv , batch transform stores
                               the  transformed  data at s3://bucket-name/out-
                               put-name-prefix/input-name-prefix/data.csv.out
                               . Batch transform doesn't upload partially pro-
                               cessed objects. For an  input  S3  object  that
                               contains   multiple   records,  it  creates  an
                               .``out`` file only if the  transform  job  suc-
                               ceeds  on  the entire file. When the input con-
                               tains multiple S3 objects, the batch  transform
                               job processes the listed S3 objects and uploads
                               only  the  output  for  successfully  processed
                               objects.  If  any object fails in the transform
                               job batch transform marks the job as failed  to
                               prompt investigation.

                            Accept -> (string)
                               The  MIME type used to specify the output data.
                               Amazon SageMaker uses the MIME type  with  each
                               http  call  to transfer data from the transform
                               job.

                            AssembleWith -> (string)
                               Defines how to  assemble  the  results  of  the
                               transform  job  as a single S3 object. Choose a
                               format that is most convenient to you. To  con-
                               catenate  the results in binary format, specify
                               None . To add a newline character at the end of
                               every transformed record, specify Line .

                            KmsKeyId -> (string)
                               The  Amazon Web Services Key Management Service
                               (Amazon Web Services KMS) key that Amazon Sage-
                               Maker  uses  to  encrypt the model artifacts at
                               rest using Amazon  S3  server-side  encryption.
                               The  KmsKeyId  can be any of the following for-
                               mats:

                               If you don't provide a KMS key ID, Amazon Sage-
                               Maker  uses  the  default KMS key for Amazon S3
                               for your role's account. For more  information,

                               The KMS key policy must grant permission to the
                               IAM  role that you specify in your  CreateModel

                        TransformResources -> (structure)
                            Describes  the  resources,  including  ML instance
                            types and ML instance count, to use for  transform
                            job.

                            InstanceType -> (string)
                               The  ML compute instance type for the transform
                               job. If you are using  built-in  algorithms  to
                               transform  moderately sized datasets, we recom-
                               mend using ml.m4.xlarge or ml.m5.large instance
                               types.

                            InstanceCount -> (integer)
                               The  number  of  ML compute instances to use in
                               the transform job.  For  distributed  transform
                               jobs,  specify  a  value  greater  than  1. The
                               default value is 1 .

                            VolumeKmsKeyId -> (string)
                               The Amazon Web Services Key Management  Service
                               (Amazon Web Services KMS) key that Amazon Sage-
                               Maker uses to encrypt model data on the storage
                               volume  attached  to the ML compute instance(s)
                               that run the batch transform job.

                               NOTE:
                                   Certain Nitro-based instances include local
                                   storage,  dependent  on  the instance type.
                                   Local storage volumes are encrypted using a
                                   hardware  module on the instance. You can't
                                   request  a  VolumeKmsKeyId  when  using  an
                                   instance type with local storage.

                                   For  a  list of instance types that support
                                   local instance storage, see Instance  Store
                                   Volumes .

                               The  VolumeKmsKeyId can be any of the following
                               formats:

                               o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

                        CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                            A timestamp that shows when the transform Job  was
                            created.

                        TransformStartTime -> (timestamp)
                            Indicates  when  the  transform  job  starts on ML
                            instances. You are billed for  the  time  interval
                            between  this  time and the value of TransformEnd-
                            Time .

                        TransformEndTime -> (timestamp)
                            Indicates when the transform  job  has  been  com-
                            pleted,  or  has stopped or failed. You are billed
                            for the time interval between this  time  and  the
                            value of TransformStartTime .

                        LabelingJobArn -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the labeling job
                            that created the transform job.

                        AutoMLJobArn -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  AutoML  job
                            that created the transform job.

                        DataProcessing -> (structure)
                            The  data structure used to specify the data to be
                            used for inference in a batch transform job and to
                            associate the data that is relevant to the predic-
                            tion results in the output. The input filter  pro-
                            vided allows you to exclude input data that is not
                            needed for inference in a batch transform job. The
                            output filter provided allows you to include input
                            data relevant to interpreting the  predictions  in
                            the output from the job. For more information, see

                            InputFilter -> (string)
                               A  JSONPath expression used to select a portion
                               of the input data to pass to the algorithm. Use
                               the  InputFilter  parameter  to exclude fields,
                               such as an ID column, from the  input.  If  you
                               want  Amazon SageMaker to pass the entire input
                               dataset to the algorithm,  accept  the  default
                               value $ .

                               Examples: "$" , "$[1:]" , "$.features"

                            OutputFilter -> (string)
                               A  JSONPath expression used to select a portion
                               of the joined dataset to  save  in  the  output
                               file  for  a  batch  transform job. If you want
                               Amazon SageMaker  to  store  the  entire  input
                               dataset  in  the output file, leave the default
                               value, $ . If you specify indexes  that  aren't
                               within   the   dimension  size  of  the  joined
                               dataset, you get an error.

                               Examples: "$" , "$[0,5:]" , "$['id','SageMaker-
                               Output']"

                            JoinSource -> (string)
                               Specifies  the  source of the data to join with
                               the transformed data. The valid values are None
                               and  Input  . The default value is None , which
                               specifies not to join the input with the trans-
                               formed  data.  If  you want the batch transform
                               job to join the original input  data  with  the
                               transformed data, set JoinSource to Input . You
                               can specify OutputFilter as an additional  fil-
                               ter  to  select a portion of the joined dataset
                               and store it in the output file.

                               For JSON or JSONLines objects, such as  a  JSON
                               array,  SageMaker  adds the transformed data to
                               the input JSON object in  an  attribute  called
                               SageMakerOutput  .  The  joined result for JSON
                               must be a key-value pair object. If  the  input
                               is  not a key-value pair object, SageMaker cre-
                               ates a new JSON file. In the new JSON file, and
                               the input data is stored under the SageMakerIn-
                               put key and the results  are  stored  in  Sage-
                               MakerOutput .

                               For  CSV  data,  SageMaker  takes each row as a
                               JSON array and joins the transformed data  with

                                   Currently  the  only supported cron expres-
                                   sions are:

                                   o If you want to set the job to start every
                                     hour,  please use the following:  Hourly:
                                     cron(0 * ? * * *)

                                   o If you  want  to  start  the  job  daily:
                                     cron(0 [00-23] ? * * *)

                                   For  example,  the following are valid cron
                                   expressions:

                                   o Daily at noon UTC: cron(0 12 ? * * *)

                                   o Daily at midnight UTC: cron(0 0 ? * * *)

                                   To support running every 6, 12  hours,  the
                                   following are also supported:
                                      cron(0 [00-23]/[01-24] ? * * *)

                                   For  example,  the following are valid cron
                                   expressions:

                                   o Every 12  hours,  starting  at  5pm  UTC:
                                     cron(0 17/12 ? * * *)

                                   o Every  two  hours  starting  at midnight:
                                     cron(0 0/2 ? * * *)

                                   NOTE:

                                      o Even though the cron expression is set
                                        to  start  at 5PM UTC, note that there
                                        could be a delay of 0-20 minutes  from
                                        the  actual  requested time to run the
                                        execution.

                                      o We recommend that if you would like  a
                                        daily  schedule,  you  do  not provide
                                        this parameter. Amazon SageMaker  will
                                        pick a time for running every day.

                                      input data that the model can consume.

                                      S3DataSource -> (structure)
                                          The S3 location of the  data  source
                                          that is associated with a channel.

                                          S3DataType -> (string)
                                             If  you  choose  S3Prefix , S3Uri
                                             identifies  a  key  name  prefix.
                                             Amazon SageMaker uses all objects
                                             with the specified key name  pre-
                                             fix for batch transform.

                                             If   you  choose  ManifestFile  ,
                                             S3Uri identifies an  object  that
                                             is  a  manifest file containing a
                                             list of object keys that you want
                                             Amazon SageMaker to use for batch
                                             transform.

                                               Amazon  SageMaker  uses to per-
                                               form tasks on your behalf.

                                   ContentType -> (string)
                                      The multipurpose internet mail extension
                                      (MIME)  type  of  the data. Amazon Sage-
                                      Maker uses the MIME type with each  http
                                      call  to  transfer data to the transform
                                      job.

                                   CompressionType -> (string)
                                      If your transform  data  is  compressed,
                                      specify  the  compression  type.  Amazon
                                      SageMaker automatically decompresses the
                                      data  for the transform job accordingly.
                                      The default value is None .

                                   SplitType -> (string)
                                      The method to use to split the transform
                                      job's  data  files into smaller batches.
                                      Splitting is necessary  when  the  total
                                      size  of each object is too large to fit
                                      in a single request. You  can  also  use
                                      data splitting to improve performance by
                                      processing      multiple      concurrent
                                      mini-batches.   The  default  value  for
                                      SplitType is None , which indicates that
                                      input  data  files  are  not  split, and
                                      request payloads contain the entire con-
                                      tents  of an input object. Set the value
                                      of  this  parameter  to  Line  to  split
                                      records on a newline character boundary.
                                      SplitType  also  supports  a  number  of
                                      record-oriented   binary  data  formats.
                                      Currently, the supported record  formats
                                      are:

                                      o RecordIO

                                      o TFRecord

                                      When splitting is enabled, the size of a
                                      mini-batch depends on the values of  the
                                      BatchStrategy and MaxPayloadInMB parame-
                                      ters. When the value of BatchStrategy is
                                      MultiRecord , Amazon SageMaker sends the
                                      maximum  number  of  records   in   each
                                      request, up to the MaxPayloadInMB limit.
                                      If the value of  BatchStrategy  is  Sin-
                                      gleRecord , Amazon SageMaker sends indi-
                                      vidual records in each request.

                                      NOTE:
                                          Some data formats represent a record
                                          as  a  binary  payload  wrapped with
                                          extra padding bytes. When  splitting
                                          is  applied to a binary data format,
                                          padding is removed if the  value  of
                                          BatchStrategy is set to SingleRecord
                                          . Padding  is  not  removed  if  the
                                          value  of  BatchStrategy  is  set to
                                          MultiRecord .

                               TransformOutput -> (structure)
                                   Identifies the Amazon S3 location where you
                                   want Amazon SageMaker to save  the  results
                                   from the transform job.

                                   S3OutputPath -> (string)
                                      The Amazon S3 path where you want Amazon
                                      SageMaker to store the  results  of  the
                                      transform      job.     For     example,
                                      s3://bucket-name/key-name-prefix .

                                      For every S3 object used  as  input  for
                                      the   transform   job,  batch  transform
                                      stores  the  transformed  data  with  an
                                      .``out``  suffix in a corresponding sub-
                                      folder in the  location  in  the  output
                                      prefix.  For example, for the input data
                                      stored                                at
                                      s3://bucket-name/input-name-pre-
                                      fix/dataset01/data.csv , batch transform
                                      stores    the    transformed   data   at
                                      s3://bucket-name/output-name-pre-
                                      fix/input-name-prefix/data.csv.out     .
                                      Batch transform doesn't upload partially
                                      processed   objects.  For  an  input  S3
                                      object that contains  multiple  records,
                                      it  creates an .``out`` file only if the
                                      transform job  succeeds  on  the  entire
                                      file.  When  the input contains multiple
                                      S3 objects, the batch transform job pro-
                                      cesses the listed S3 objects and uploads
                                      only the output  for  successfully  pro-
                                      cessed  objects.  If any object fails in
                                      the transform job batch transform  marks
                                      the  job  as failed to prompt investiga-
                                      tion.

                                   Accept -> (string)
                                      The MIME type used to specify the output
                                      data.  Amazon  SageMaker  uses  the MIME
                                      type with each  http  call  to  transfer
                                      data from the transform job.

                                   AssembleWith -> (string)

                                      datasets,     we     recommend     using
                                      ml.m4.xlarge   or  ml.m5.large  instance
                                      types.

                                   InstanceCount -> (integer)

                                          the  instance  type.  Local  storage
                                          volumes are encrypted using a  hard-
                                          ware  module  on  the  instance. You
                                          can't request a VolumeKmsKeyId  when
                                          using  an  instance  type with local
                                          storage.
