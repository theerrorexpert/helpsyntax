NAME
       create-presigned-notebook-instance-url -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a URL that you can use to connect to the Jupyter server from a
       notebook instance. In the Amazon SageMaker  console,  when  you  choose
       Open  next  to  a  notebook  instance, Amazon SageMaker opens a new tab
       showing the Jupyter server home page from the  notebook  instance.  The
       console uses this API to get the URL and show the page.

       The  IAM  role or user used to call this API defines the permissions to
       access the notebook instance. Once the presigned  URL  is  created,  no
       additional permission is required to access this URL. IAM authorization
       policies for this API are also enforced for every HTTP request and Web-
       Socket frame that attempts to connect to the notebook instance.

       You can restrict access to this API and to the URL that it returns to a
       list of IP addresses that you specify. Use the  NotIpAddress  condition
       operator and the aws:SourceIP condition context key to specify the list
       of IP addresses that you want to have access to the notebook  instance.
       For  more  information,  see  Limit Access to a Notebook Instance by IP
       Address .

       NOTE:
          The URL that you get  from  a  call  to   CreatePresignedNotebookIn-
          stanceUrl  is  valid  only  for 5 minutes. If you try to use the URL
          after the 5-minute limit expires, you are directed to the Amazon Web
          Services console sign-in page.

SYNOPSIS
            create-presigned-notebook-instance-url
          --notebook-instance-name <value>
          [--session-expiration-duration-in-seconds <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --notebook-instance-name (string)
          The name of the notebook instance.

       --session-expiration-duration-in-seconds (integer)
          The duration of the session, in seconds. The default is 12 hours.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AuthorizedUrl -> (string)
          A JSON object that contains the URL string.
