SYNOPSIS
            query-lineage
          --start-arns <value>
          [--direction <value>]
          [--include-edges | --no-include-edges]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--max-depth <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]

OPTIONS
       --start-arns (list)
          A  list  of  resource  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that represent the
          starting point for your lineage query.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --direction (string)
          Associations between lineage entities are directed.  This  parameter
          determines the direction from the StartArn(s) the query will look.

          Possible values:

          o Both

          o Ascendants

          o Descendants

       --include-edges | --no-include-edges (boolean)
          Setting  this  value  to True will retrieve not only the entities of
          interest but also the Associations and lineage entities on the path.
          Set  to False to only return lineage entities that match your query.

       --filters (structure)
          A set of filtering parameters that allow you to specify which  enti-
          ties should be returned.

          o Properties  -  Key-value  pairs  to match on the lineage entities'
            properties.

          o LineageTypes - A set of lineage entity  types  to  match  on.  For
            example: TrialComponent , Artifact , or Context .

          o CreatedBefore - Filter entities created before this date.

          o ModifiedBefore - Filter entities modified before this date.

          o ModifiedAfter - Filter entities modified after this date.

          Types -> (list)
              Filter  the  lineage entities connected to the StartArn by type.
              For example: DataSet , Model , Endpoint , or ModelDeployment .

              (string)

          LineageTypes -> (list)
              Filter the lineage entities connected to the StartArn (s) by the
              type of the lineage entity.

              (string)

          CreatedBefore -> (timestamp)
              Filter  the  lineage  entities  connected to the StartArn (s) by
              created date.

          CreatedAfter -> (timestamp)
              Filter the lineage entities connected to the StartArn (s)  after
              the create date.

          ModifiedBefore -> (timestamp)
              Filter the lineage entities connected to the StartArn (s) before
              the last modified date.

          ModifiedAfter -> (timestamp)
              Filter the lineage entities connected to the StartArn (s)  after
              the last modified date.

          Properties -> (map)
              Filter  the  lineage entities connected to the StartArn (s) by a
              set if property key value pairs. If multiple pairs are provided,
              an  entity  will be included in the results if it matches any of
              the provided pairs.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Types=string,string,LineageTypes=string,string,CreatedBefore=timestamp,CreatedAfter=timestamp,ModifiedBefore=timestamp,ModifiedAfter=timestamp,Properties={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Types": ["string", ...],
            "LineageTypes": ["TrialComponent"|"Artifact"|"Context"|"Action", ...],
            "CreatedBefore": timestamp,
            "CreatedAfter": timestamp,
            "ModifiedBefore": timestamp,
            "ModifiedAfter": timestamp,
            "Properties": {"string": "string"
              ...}
          }

       --max-depth (integer)
          The maximum depth in lineage relationships from the  StartArns  that
          will  be traversed. Depth is a measure of the number of Associations
          from the StartArn entity to the matched results.

       --max-results (integer)
          Limits the number of vertices in the results. Use the NextToken in a
          response to to retrieve the next page of results.

       --next-token (string)
          Limits the number of vertices in the request. Use the NextToken in a
          response to to retrieve the next page of results.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              Arn -> (string)

              SourceArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the source lineage entity
                 of the directed edge.

              DestinationArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the  destination  lineage
                 entity of the directed edge.

              AssociationType -> (string)
                 The type of the Association(Edge) between the source and des-
                 tination. For example ContributedTo , Produced , or  Derived-
                 From .
