CREATE-TRIAL()                                                  CREATE-TRIAL()



NAME
       create-trial -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  SageMaker  trial  . A trial is a set of steps called trial
       components that produce a machine learning model. A trial is part of  a
       single SageMaker experiment .

       When  you use SageMaker Studio or the SageMaker Python SDK, all experi-
       ments, trials, and trial components are automatically tracked,  logged,
       and  indexed.  When  you  use  the  Amazon  Web Services SDK for Python
       (Boto), you must use the logging APIs provided by the SDK.

       You can add tags to a trial and then use the  Search API to search  for
       the tags.

       To  get  a list of all your trials, call the  ListTrials API. To view a
       trial's properties, call the  DescribeTrial API. To create a trial com-
       ponent, call the  CreateTrialComponent API.

SYNOPSIS
            create-trial
          --trial-name <value>
          [--display-name <value>]
          --experiment-name <value>
          [--metadata-properties <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --trial-name (string)
          The  name  of  the trial. The name must be unique in your Amazon Web
          Services account and is not case-sensitive.

       --display-name (string)
          The name of the trial as displayed. The  name  doesn't  need  to  be
          unique. If DisplayName isn't specified, TrialName is displayed.

       --experiment-name (string)
          The name of the experiment to associate the trial with.

       --metadata-properties (structure)
          Metadata  properties  of the tracking entity, trial, or trial compo-
          nent.

          CommitId -> (string)
              The commit ID.

          Repository -> (string)
              The repository.

          GeneratedBy -> (string)
              The entity this entity was generated by.

          ProjectId -> (string)
              The project ID.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CommitId=string,Repository=string,GeneratedBy=string,ProjectId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CommitId": "string",
            "Repository": "string",
            "GeneratedBy": "string",
            "ProjectId": "string"
          }

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags to associate with the trial. You can use  Search  API
          to search on the tags.

          (structure)
              A  tag object that consists of a key and an optional value, used
              to manage metadata for SageMaker Amazon Web Services  resources.

              You  can add tags to notebook instances, training jobs, hyperpa-
              rameter tuning jobs,  batch  transform  jobs,  models,  labeling
              jobs,  work  teams,  endpoint configurations, and endpoints. For
              more information on adding  tags  to  SageMaker  resources,  see
              AddTags .

              For  more information on adding metadata to your Amazon Web Ser-
              vices resources with tagging, see Tagging  Amazon  Web  Services
              resources . For advice on best practices for managing Amazon Web
              Services resources with tagging,  see  Tagging  Best  Practices:
              Implement  an  Effective  Amazon  Web  Services Resource Tagging
              Strategy .

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag key. Tag keys must be unique per resource.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TrialArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the trial.
