LIST-PIPELINE-EXECUTIONS()                          LIST-PIPELINE-EXECUTIONS()



NAME
       list-pipeline-executions -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of the pipeline executions.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-pipeline-executions  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: PipelineExecutionSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-pipeline-executions
          --pipeline-name <value>
          [--created-after <value>]
          [--created-before <value>]
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pipeline-name (string)
          The name of the pipeline.

       --created-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns the  pipeline  executions  that  were  created
          after a specified time.

       --created-before (timestamp)
          A  filter  that  returns  the  pipeline executions that were created
          before a specified time.

       --sort-by (string)
          The field by which to sort results. The default is CreatedTime .

          Possible values:

          o CreationTime

          o PipelineExecutionArn

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for results.

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PipelineExecutionSummaries -> (list)
          Contains  a sorted list of pipeline execution summary objects match-
          ing the specified filters. Each  run  summary  includes  the  Amazon
          Resource Name (ARN) of the pipeline execution, the run date, and the
          status. This list can be empty.

          (structure)
              A pipeline execution summary.

              PipelineExecutionArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the pipeline execution.

              StartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The start time of the pipeline execution.

              PipelineExecutionStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the pipeline execution.

              PipelineExecutionDescription -> (string)
                 The description of the pipeline execution.

              PipelineExecutionDisplayName -> (string)
                 The display name of the pipeline execution.

              PipelineExecutionFailureReason -> (string)
                 A message generated by SageMaker Pipelines describing why the
                 pipeline execution failed.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  result  of  the previous ListPipelineExecutions request was
          truncated, the response includes a NextToken . To retrieve the  next
          set of pipeline executions, use the token in the next request.
