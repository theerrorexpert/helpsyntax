CREATE-FEATURE-GROUP()                                  CREATE-FEATURE-GROUP()



NAME
       create-feature-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Create  a  new  FeatureGroup  .  A  FeatureGroup is a group of Features
       defined in the FeatureStore to describe a Record .

       The FeatureGroup defines the schema and features contained in the  Fea-
       tureGroup.  A FeatureGroup definition is composed of a list of Features
       , a RecordIdentifierFeatureName , an EventTimeFeatureName and  configu-
       rations  for  its  OnlineStore and OfflineStore . Check Amazon Web Ser-
       vices service quotas to see the FeatureGroup s quota  for  your  Amazon
       Web Services account.

       WARNING:
          You must include at least one of OnlineStoreConfig and OfflineStore-
          Config to create a FeatureGroup .

OPTIONS
       --feature-group-name (string)
          The name of the FeatureGroup . The name must  be  unique  within  an
          Amazon  Web  Services  Region in an Amazon Web Services account. The
          name:

          o Must start and end with an alphanumeric character.

          o Can only contain alphanumeric character and  hyphens.  Spaces  are
            not allowed.

       --record-identifier-feature-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  Feature whose value uniquely identifies a Record
          defined in the FeatureStore . Only the latest record per  identifier
          value  will  be stored in the OnlineStore . RecordIdentifierFeature-
          Name must be one of feature definitions' names.

          You use the RecordIdentifierFeatureName to access data in a Feature-
          Store .

          This name:

          o Must start and end with an alphanumeric character.

          o Can  only  contains alphanumeric characters, hyphens, underscores.
            Spaces are not allowed.

       --event-time-feature-name (string)
          The name of the feature that stores the EventTime of a Record  in  a
          FeatureGroup .

          An  EventTime is a point in time when a new event occurs that corre-
          sponds to the creation or update of a Record in a FeatureGroup . All
          Records in the FeatureGroup must have a corresponding EventTime .

          An EventTime can be a String or Fractional .

          o Fractional  : EventTime feature values must be a Unix timestamp in
            seconds.

          o String : EventTime feature values must be an  ISO-8601  string  in
            the     format.    The    following    formats    are    supported
            yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ and yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ where yyyy ,
            MM , and dd represent the year, month, and day respectively and HH
            , mm , ss , and if applicable, SSS represent the hour, month, sec-
            ond and milliseconds respsectively. 'T' and Z are constants.

       --feature-definitions (list)

              write_time , api_invocation_time

          You can create up to 2,500 FeatureDefinition s per FeatureGroup .

          (structure)
              A list of features. You must include FeatureName and FeatureType
              . Valid feature FeatureType s  are  Integral  ,  Fractional  and
              String .

              FeatureName -> (string)

          EnableOnlineStore -> (boolean)
              Turn  OnlineStore  off by specifying False for the EnableOnline-
              Store flag. Turn OnlineStore  on  by  specifying  True  for  the
              EnableOnlineStore flag.

              The default value is False .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SecurityConfig={KmsKeyId=string},EnableOnlineStore=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

       --offline-store-config (structure)
          Use this to configure an OfflineFeatureStore . This parameter allows
          you to specify:

            OfflineStore .

          o A configuration for an Amazon Web Services Glue or Amazon Web Ser-
            vices Hive data catalog.

          o An KMS encryption key to encrypt the Amazon S3 location  used  for
            OfflineStore  . If KMS encryption key is not specified, by default
            we encrypt all data at rest using Amazon Web Services KMS key.  By
            defining  your bucket-level key for SSE, you can reduce Amazon Web
            Services KMS requests costs by up to 99 percent.

              rameter tuning jobs,  batch  transform  jobs,  models,  labeling
              jobs,  work  teams,  endpoint configurations, and endpoints. For
              more information on adding  tags  to  SageMaker  resources,  see
              AddTags .

              For  more information on adding metadata to your Amazon Web Ser-
              vices resources with tagging, see Tagging  Amazon  Web  Services
              resources . For advice on best practices for managing Amazon Web
              Services resources with tagging,  see  Tagging  Best  Practices:
              Implement  an  Effective  Amazon  Web  Services Resource Tagging
              Strategy .

              Key -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FeatureGroupArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  FeatureGroup  .  This  is  a
          unique identifier for the feature group.
