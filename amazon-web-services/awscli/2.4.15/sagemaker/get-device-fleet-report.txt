NAME
       get-device-fleet-report -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes a fleet.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-device-fleet-report
          --device-fleet-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --device-fleet-name (string)
          The name of the fleet.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the device.

              The deployment type SageMaker Edge  Manager  will  create.  Cur-
              rently  only supports Amazon Web Services IoT Greengrass Version
              2 components.

          PresetDeploymentConfig -> (string)
              The configuration used to create deployment  artifacts.  Specify
              configuration options with a JSON string. The available configu-
              ration options for each type are:

              o ComponentName (optional) - Name of the  GreenGrass  V2  compo-
                nent. If not specified, the default name generated consists of
                "SagemakerEdgeManager" and the name  of  your  SageMaker  Edge
                Manager packaging job.

              NOTE:
                 Amazon Web Services IoT Greengrass uses semantic versions for
                 components.  Semantic  versions  follow  a*major.minor.patch*
                 number system. For  example,  version  1.0.0  represents  the
                 first  major  release  for a component. For more information,
                 see the semantic version specification .
