DESCRIBE-ENDPOINT-CONFIG()                          DESCRIBE-ENDPOINT-CONFIG()



NAME
       describe-endpoint-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the description of an endpoint configuration created using the
       CreateEndpointConfig API.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-endpoint-config
          --endpoint-config-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --endpoint-config-name (string)
          The name of the endpoint configuration.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EndpointConfigName -> (string)
          Name of the Amazon SageMaker endpoint configuration.

       EndpointConfigArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint configuration.

       ProductionVariants -> (list)
          An array of ProductionVariant objects, one for each model  that  you
          want to host at this endpoint.

          (structure)
              Identifies  a model that you want to host and the resources cho-
              sen to deploy for hosting it. If you are deploying multiple mod-
              els,  tell  Amazon SageMaker how to distribute traffic among the
              models by specifying variant weights.

              VariantName -> (string)
                 The name of the production variant.

              ModelName -> (string)
                 The name of the model that you want to host. This is the name
                 that you specified when creating the model.

              InitialInstanceCount -> (integer)
                 Number of instances to launch initially.

              InstanceType -> (string)
                 The ML compute instance type.

              InitialVariantWeight -> (float)
                 Determines initial traffic distribution among all of the mod-
                 els that you specify in the endpoint configuration. The traf-
                 fic to a production variant is determined by the ratio of the
                 VariantWeight to the sum of all VariantWeight  values  across
                 all ProductionVariants. If unspecified, it defaults to 1.0.

              AcceleratorType -> (string)
                 The  size  of  the Elastic Inference (EI) instance to use for
                 the production variant. EI instances  provide  on-demand  GPU
                 computing  for  inference.  For  more  information, see Using
                 Elastic Inference in Amazon SageMaker .

              CoreDumpConfig -> (structure)
                 Specifies configuration for a core dump from the  model  con-
                 tainer when the process crashes.

                 DestinationS3Uri -> (string)
                     The Amazon S3 bucket to send the core dump to.

                 KmsKeyId -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Web  Services Key Management Service (Amazon
                     Web Services KMS)  key  that  Amazon  SageMaker  uses  to
                     encrypt  the  core  dump  data  at  rest  using Amazon S3
                     server-side encryption. The KmsKeyId can be  any  of  the
                     following formats:

                     o // KMS Key ID  "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                     o //   Amazon   Resource   Name   (ARN)   of  a  KMS  Key
                       "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                     o // KMS Key Alias  "alias/ExampleAlias"

                     o //  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  a  KMS Key Alias
                       "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias"

                     If  you use a KMS key ID or an alias of your KMS key, the
                     Amazon SageMaker execution role must include  permissions
                     to  call kms:Encrypt . If you don't provide a KMS key ID,
                     Amazon SageMaker uses the default KMS key for  Amazon  S3
                     for   your   role's   account.   Amazon   SageMaker  uses
                     server-side encryption with KMS-managed keys for  Output-
                     DataConfig . If you use a bucket policy with an s3:PutOb-
                     ject permission that only allows objects with server-side
                     encryption,      set     the     condition     key     of
                     s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption to "aws:kms" .  For  more
                     information,  see KMS-Managed Encryption Keys in the Ama-
                     zon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.

                     The KMS key policy must grant permission to the IAM  role
                     that  you  specify  in your CreateEndpoint and UpdateEnd-
                     point requests. For more information, see Using Key Poli-
                     cies  in  Amazon  Web Services KMS in the Amazon Web Ser-
                     vices Key Management Service Developer Guide .

              ServerlessConfig -> (structure)

                 serverless    endpoint    configuration    instead    of   an
                 instance-based endpoint configuration.

                 NOTE:
