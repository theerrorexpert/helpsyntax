NAME
       describe-processing-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a description of a processing job.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-processing-job
          --processing-job-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --processing-job-name (string)
          The  name  of  the processing job. The name must be unique within an
          Amazon Web Services Region in the Amazon Web Services account.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ProcessingInputs -> (list)
          The inputs for a processing job.

          (structure)
              The inputs for a processing job. The processing input must spec-
              ify exactly one of either S3Input or DatasetDefinition types.

              InputName -> (string)
                 The name for the processing job input.

              AppManaged -> (boolean)
                 When  True  , input operations such as data download are man-
                 aged natively by the processing job application.  When  False
                 (default),  input operations are managed by Amazon SageMaker.

              S3Input -> (structure)
                 Configuration for downloading input data from Amazon S3  into
                 the processing container.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     The  URI  of  the Amazon S3 prefix Amazon SageMaker down-
                     loads data required to run a processing job.

                 LocalPath -> (string)
                     The local path in your container where  you  want  Amazon
                     SageMaker  to  write input data to. LocalPath is an abso-
                     lute  path  to  the  input  data  and  must  begin   with
                     /opt/ml/processing/  .  LocalPath is a required parameter
                     when AppManaged is False (default).

                 S3DataType -> (string)
                     Whether you use an S3Prefix or  a  ManifestFile  for  the
                     data  type.  If  you choose S3Prefix , S3Uri identifies a
                     key name prefix. Amazon SageMaker uses all  objects  with
                     the  specified key name prefix for the processing job. If
                     you choose ManifestFile , S3Uri identifies an object that
                     is  a manifest file containing a list of object keys that
                     you want Amazon SageMaker to use for the processing  job.

                 S3InputMode -> (string)
                     Whether  to  use  File  or Pipe input mode. In File mode,
                     Amazon SageMaker copies the data from  the  input  source
                     onto  the  local  ML  storage volume before starting your
                     processing container. This  is  the  most  commonly  used
                     input  mode. In Pipe mode, Amazon SageMaker streams input
                     data from the source directly  to  your  processing  con-
                     tainer into named pipes without using the ML storage vol-
                     ume.

                 S3DataDistributionType -> (string)
                     Whether to distribute the data from Amazon S3 to all pro-
                     cessing  instances  with FullyReplicated , or whether the
                     data from Amazon S3 is shared by Amazon S3 key, download-
                     ing one shard of data to each processing instance.

                 S3CompressionType -> (string)
                     Whether to GZIP-decompress the data in Amazon S3 as it is
                     streamed into the processing container. Gzip can only  be
                     used  when Pipe mode is specified as the S3InputMode . In
                     Pipe mode, Amazon SageMaker streams input data  from  the
                     source  directly  to your container without using the EBS
                     volume.

              DatasetDefinition -> (structure)
                 Configuration for a Dataset Definition input.

                 LocalPath -> (string)
                     The  local  path where you want Amazon SageMaker to down-
                     load the Dataset Definition inputs to  run  a  processing
                     job.  LocalPath  is  an  absolute path to the input data.
                     This is a required parameter  when  AppManaged  is  False
                     (default).

                 DataDistributionType -> (string)
                     Whether  the  generated  dataset  is  FullyReplicated  or
                     ShardedByS3Key (default).

                 InputMode -> (string)
                     Whether to use File or Pipe input mode. In File (default)
                     mode,  Amazon  SageMaker  copies  the data from the input
                     source onto the local Amazon Elastic Block Store  (Amazon
                     EBS)  volumes  before  starting  your training algorithm.
                     This is the most commonly used input mode. In Pipe  mode,
                     Amazon  SageMaker  streams  input  data  from  the source
                     directly to your algorithm without using the EBS  volume.

                        records into your Feature Store.

                 AppManaged -> (boolean)
                     When  True  ,  output  operations such as data upload are
                     managed natively by the processing job application.  When
                     False  (default), output operations are managed by Amazon
                     SageMaker.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web  Ser-
              vices  KMS)  key  that Amazon SageMaker uses to encrypt the pro-
              cessing job output. KmsKeyId can be an ID of a KMS key, ARN of a
              KMS key, alias of a KMS key, or alias of a KMS key. The KmsKeyId
              is applied to all outputs.

       ProcessingJobName -> (string)
          The name of the processing job. The name must be  unique  within  an
          Amazon Web Services Region in the Amazon Web Services account.

       ProcessingResources -> (structure)
          Identifies  the resources, ML compute instances, and ML storage vol-
          umes to deploy for a processing job. In  distributed  training,  you
          specify more than one instance.

              The configuration for the resources in a cluster used to run the
              processing job.

              InstanceCount -> (integer)
                 The number of ML compute instances to use in  the  processing
                 job. For distributed processing jobs, specify a value greater
                 than 1. The default value is 1.

              InstanceType -> (string)
                 The ML compute instance type for the processing job.

              VolumeSizeInGB -> (integer)
                 The size of the ML storage volume in gigabytes that you  want
                 to provision. You must specify sufficient ML storage for your
                 scenario.

                 NOTE:
                     Certain Nitro-based instances include local storage  with
                     a  fixed total size, dependent on the instance type. When
                     using these instances for  processing,  Amazon  SageMaker
                     mounts  the  local instance storage instead of Amazon EBS
                     gp2 storage. You can't request a  VolumeSizeInGB  greater
                     than the total size of the local instance storage.

                     For  a list of instance types that support local instance
                     storage, including the total size per instance type,  see
                     Instance Store Volumes .

              VolumeKmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web  Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web
                 Services KMS) key that Amazon SageMaker uses to encrypt  data
                 on  the storage volume attached to the ML compute instance(s)
                 that run the processing job.

                 NOTE:
                     Certain  Nitro-based  instances  include  local  storage,
                     dependent on the instance type. Local storage volumes are
                     encrypted using a hardware module on  the  instance.  You
                     can't  request  a  VolumeKmsKeyId  when using an instance
                     type with local storage.

                     For a list of instance types that support local  instance
                     storage, see Instance Store Volumes .
