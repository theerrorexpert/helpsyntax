LIST-FEATURE-GROUPS()                                    LIST-FEATURE-GROUPS()



NAME
       list-feature-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       List FeatureGroup s based on given filter and order.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-feature-groups is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: FeatureGroupSummaries

OPTIONS
       --name-contains (string)
          A string that partially matches one or more  FeatureGroup  s  names.
          Filters FeatureGroup s by name.

       --feature-group-status-equals (string)
          A FeatureGroup status. Filters by FeatureGroup status.

          Possible values:

          o Creating

          o Created

          o CreateFailed

          o Deleting

          o DeleteFailed

       --offline-store-status-equals (string)
          An OfflineStore status. Filters by OfflineStore status.

          Possible values:

          o Active

          o Blocked

          o Disabled

       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          Use  this  parameter  to  search for FeatureGroups s created after a
          specific date and time.

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          Use this parameter to search for FeatureGroups s  created  before  a
          specific date and time.

       --sort-order (string)
          The order in which feature groups are listed.

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --sort-by (string)
          The value on which the feature group list is sorted.

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o FeatureGroupStatus

          o OfflineStoreStatus

          o CreationTime

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
