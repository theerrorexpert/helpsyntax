NAME
       describe-model-explainability-job-definition -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a description of a model explainability job definition.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-model-explainability-job-definition
          --job-definition-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-definition-name (string)
          The  name  of the model explainability job definition. The name must
          be unique within an Amazon Web Services Region  in  the  Amazon  Web
          Services account.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              NOTE:
                 The MaxRuntimeInSeconds cannot exceed the  frequency  of  the
                 job.  For  data quality and model explainability, this can be
                 up to 3600 seconds for an hourly schedule. For model bias and
                 model  quality  hourly schedules, this can be up to 1800 sec-
                 onds.
