STOP-PIPELINE-EXECUTION()                            STOP-PIPELINE-EXECUTION()



NAME
       stop-pipeline-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Stops a pipeline execution.
          Callback Step

       A  pipeline execution won't stop while a callback step is running. When
       you call StopPipelineExecution on a pipeline execution with  a  running
       callback  step, SageMaker Pipelines sends an additional Amazon SQS mes-
       sage to the specified SQS queue. The body of the SQS message contains a
       "Status" field which is set to "Stopping".

       You  should  add  logic to your Amazon SQS message consumer to take any
       needed action (for example, resource cleanup) upon receipt of the  mes-
       sage  followed  by  a call to SendPipelineExecutionStepSuccess or Send-
       PipelineExecutionStepFailure .

       Only when SageMaker Pipelines receives one of these calls will it  stop
       the pipeline execution.
          Lambda Step

       A  pipeline  execution  can't be stopped while a lambda step is running
       because the Lambda  function  invoked  by  the  lambda  step  can't  be
       stopped. If you attempt to stop the execution while the Lambda function
       is running, the pipeline waits for the Lambda  function  to  finish  or
       until  the  timeout  is hit, whichever occurs first, and then stops. If
       the Lambda function finishes, the pipeline execution status is  Stopped
       . If the timeout is hit the pipeline execution status is Failed .

SYNOPSIS
            stop-pipeline-execution
          --pipeline-execution-arn <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pipeline-execution-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the pipeline execution.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the operation. An idempotent operation  completes  no
          more than once.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PipelineExecutionArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the pipeline execution.
