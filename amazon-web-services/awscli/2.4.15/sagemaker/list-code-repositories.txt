LIST-CODE-REPOSITORIES()                              LIST-CODE-REPOSITORIES()



NAME
       list-code-repositories -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of the Git repositories in your account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-code-repositories is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: CodeRepositorySummaryList

OPTIONS
       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only Git repositories that were created  after
          the specified time.

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only Git repositories that were created before
          the specified time.

       --last-modified-time-after (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only Git repositories that were last  modified
          after the specified time.

       --last-modified-time-before (timestamp)
          A  filter that returns only Git repositories that were last modified
          before the specified time.

       --name-contains (string)
          A string in the Git repositories  name.  This  filter  returns  only
          repositories whose name contains the specified string.

       --sort-by (string)
          The field to sort results by. The default is Name .

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreationTime

          o LastModifiedTime

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for results. The default is Ascending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CodeRepositorySummaryList -> (list)

          ifies the following values for the repository:

            repository and the ARN of the Amazon Web Services Secrets  Manager
            secret  that  contains  the credentials used to access the reposi-
            tory.

          (structure)

              GitConfig -> (structure)

                 vices  Secrets  Manager  secret that contains the credentials
                 used to access the repository.

                 RepositoryUrl -> (string)
                     The URL where the Git repository is located.

                 Branch -> (string)
                     The default branch for the Git repository.

                 SecretArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web Services
                     Secrets Manager secret that contains the credentials used
                     to access the git repository.  The  secret  must  have  a
                     staging  label of AWSCURRENT and must be in the following
                     format:
                        {"username": *UserName* , "password": *Password* }

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the result of a ListCodeRepositoriesOutput request was truncated,

          repositories, use the token in the next request.
