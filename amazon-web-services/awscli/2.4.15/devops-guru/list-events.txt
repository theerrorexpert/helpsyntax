LIST-EVENTS()                                                    LIST-EVENTS()



NAME
       list-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of the events emitted by the resources that are evalu-
       ated by DevOps Guru. You can use filters to specify  which  events  are
       returned.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-events  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: Events

SYNOPSIS
            list-events
          --filters <value>
          [--account-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (structure)
          A ListEventsFilters object used to specify which events to return.

          InsightId -> (string)
              An ID of an insight that is related to the events  you  want  to
              filter for.

          EventTimeRange -> (structure)
              A  time  range during which you want the filtered events to have
              occurred.

              FromTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the event started.

              ToTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the event ended.

          EventClass -> (string)
              The class of the events you want to filter for, such as  an  in-
              frastructure change, a deployment, or a schema change.

          EventSource -> (string)
              The  Amazon Web Services source that emitted the events you want
              to filter for.

          DataSource -> (string)
              The source, AWS_CLOUD_TRAIL or AWS_CODE_DEPLOY , of  the  events
              you want returned.

          ResourceCollection -> (structure)
              A  collection  of  Amazon  Web  Services  resources supported by
              DevOps Guru. The two types of Amazon Web Services resource  col-
              lections supported are Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks
              and Amazon Web Services resources that contain the  same  Amazon
              Web  Services  tag. DevOps Guru can be configured to analyze the
              Amazon Web Services resources that are defined in the stacks  or
              that  are  tagged using the same tag key . You can specify up to
              500 Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks.

              CloudFormation -> (structure)
                 An array of the names of Amazon Web  Services  CloudFormation
                 stacks.  The stacks define Amazon Web Services resources that
                 DevOps Guru analyzes. You can specify up to  500  Amazon  Web
                 Services CloudFormation stacks.

                 StackNames -> (list)
                     An array of CloudFormation stack names.

                     (string)

              Tags -> (list)
                 The  Amazon  Web  Services tags that are used by resources in
                 the resource collection.

                 Tags help you identify and organize your Amazon Web  Services
                 resources. Many Amazon Web Services services support tagging,
                 so you can assign the same tag to  resources  from  different
                 services  to  indicate  that  the  resources are related. For
                 example, you can assign the same tag to  an  Amazon  DynamoDB
                 table  resource  that  you  assign to an Lambda function. For
                 more information about using tags, see the Tagging best prac-
                 tices whitepaper.

                 Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

                 o A  tag key (for example, CostCenter , Environment , Project
                   , or Secret ). Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                 o An optional field  known  as  a  tag  value  (for  example,
                   111122223333  ,  Production , or a team name). Omitting the
                   tag value is the same as using an empty  string.  Like  tag
                   keys , tag values are case-sensitive.

                 Together these are known as key -value pairs.

                 WARNING:
                     The string used for a key in a tag that you use to define
                     your  resource  coverage  must  begin  with  the   prefix
                     Devops-guru-  .  The tag key might be Devops-guru-deploy-
                     ment-application or Devops-guru-rds-application  .  While
                     keys are case-sensitive, the case of key characters don't
                     matter to DevOps Guru. For  example,  DevOps  Guru  works
                     with   a  key  named  devops-guru-rds  and  a  key  named
                     DevOps-Guru-RDS .  Possible  key  /value  pairs  in  your
                     application   might   be  Devops-Guru-production-applica-
                     tion/RDS or Devops-Guru-production-application/containers
                     .

                        . Possible key /value pairs in your application  might
                        be      Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS      or
                        Devops-Guru-production-application/containers .

                     AppBoundaryKey -> (string)
                        An Amazon Web Services tag key that is used  to  iden-
                        tify  the  Amazon  Web  Services resources that DevOps
                        Guru analyzes. All Amazon Web  Services  resources  in
                        your  account  and Region tagged with this key make up
                        your DevOps Guru application and analysis boundary.

                        WARNING:
                            The string used for a key in a tag that you use to
                            define  your resource coverage must begin with the
                            prefix  Devops-guru-  .  The  tag  key  might   be

                            Devops-guru-rds-application  .  While   keys   are

                            works  with  a key named devops-guru-rds and a key
                            named DevOps-Guru-RDS . Possible key /value  pairs
                            in  your  application might be Devops-Guru-produc-
                            tion-application/RDS    or     Devops-Guru-produc-
                            tion-application/containers .

                     TagValues -> (list)
                        The values in an Amazon Web Services tag collection.

                        The tag's value is an optional field used to associate
                        a string with the tag key (for example, 111122223333 ,
                        Production  ,  or  a team name). The key and value are
                        the tag's key pair. Omitting the tag value is the same
                        as  using  an empty string. Like tag keys , tag values
                        are case-sensitive. You can specify a maximum  of  256
                        characters for a tag value.

              "FromTime": timestamp,
              "ToTime": timestamp
            },

                ...
              ]
            }
          }

       --account-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Events -> (list)
          A list of the requested events.

          (structure)
              An Amazon Web  Services  resource  event.  Amazon  Web  Services
              resource  events and metrics are analyzed by DevOps Guru to find
              anomalous behavior and provide recommendations to  improve  your
              operational solutions.

              ResourceCollection -> (structure)
                 A  collection  of  Amazon Web Services resources supported by
                 DevOps Guru. The two types of Amazon  Web  Services  resource
                 collections  supported are Amazon Web Services CloudFormation
                 stacks and Amazon Web Services  resources  that  contain  the
                 same  Amazon  Web Services tag. DevOps Guru can be configured
                 to analyze the Amazon Web Services resources that are defined
                 in the stacks or that are tagged using the same tag key . You
                 can specify up to  500  Amazon  Web  Services  CloudFormation
                 stacks.

                 CloudFormation -> (structure)
                     An  array of the names of Amazon Web Services CloudForma-
                     tion  stacks.  The  stacks  define  Amazon  Web  Services
                     resources  that  DevOps Guru analyzes. You can specify up
                     to 500 Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks.

                     StackNames -> (list)
                        An array of CloudFormation stack names.

                        (string)

                 Tags -> (list)
                     The Amazon Web Services tags that are used  by  resources

                        Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

                        o A tag key (for example, CostCenter ,  Environment  ,
                          Project  , or Secret ). Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                        o An optional field known as a tag value (for example,
                          111122223333  ,  Production , or a team name). Omit-
                          ting the tag value is the same  as  using  an  empty
                          string.  Like  tag keys , tag values are case-sensi-
                          tive.

                        Together these are known as key -value pairs.

                        WARNING:
                            The string used for a key in a tag that you use to
                            define  your resource coverage must begin with the
                            prefix  Devops-guru-  .  The  tag  key  might   be
                            Devops-guru-deployment-application              or
                            Devops-guru-rds-application  .  While   keys   are
                            case-sensitive,  the  case of key characters don't
                            matter to DevOps Guru. For  example,  DevOps  Guru
                            works  with  a key named devops-guru-rds and a key
                            named DevOps-Guru-RDS . Possible key /value  pairs
                            in  your  application might be Devops-Guru-produc-
                            tion-application/RDS    or     Devops-Guru-produc-
                            tion-application/containers .

                        AppBoundaryKey -> (string)
                            An  Amazon  Web  Services  tag key that is used to
                            identify the Amazon Web  Services  resources  that
                            DevOps  Guru  analyzes.  All  Amazon  Web Services
                            resources in your account and Region  tagged  with
                            this  key make up your DevOps Guru application and
                            analysis boundary.

                            WARNING:
                               The string used for a key in a tag that you use
                               to  define  your  resource  coverage must begin
                               with the prefix  Devops-guru-  .  The  tag  key
                               might  be Devops-guru-deployment-application or
                               Devops-guru-rds-application .  While  keys  are
                               case-sensitive,  the  case  of  key  characters
                               don't  matter  to  DevOps  Guru.  For  example,
                               DevOps    Guru   works   with   a   key   named
                               devops-guru-rds and a key named DevOps-Guru-RDS
                               . Possible key /value pairs in your application
                               might be Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS
                               or  Devops-Guru-production-application/contain-
                               ers .

                        TagValues -> (list)
                            The values in an Amazon Web Services  tag  collec-
                            tion.

                            The tag's value is an optional field used to asso-
                            ciate a string with  the  tag  key  (for  example,
                            111122223333  ,  Production , or a team name). The
                            key and value are the tag's key pair. Omitting the
                            tag  value  is  the same as using an empty string.
                            Like tag keys , tag values are case-sensitive. You
                            can  specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag
                            value.
