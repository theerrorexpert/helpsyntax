GET-RESOURCE-COLLECTION()                            GET-RESOURCE-COLLECTION()



NAME
       get-resource-collection -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  lists  Amazon Web Services resources that are of the specified
       resource collection type. The two types of Amazon Web Services resource
       collections supported are Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks and
       Amazon Web Services resources that contain the same Amazon Web Services
       tag.  DevOps  Guru can be configured to analyze the Amazon Web Services
       resources that are defined in the stacks or that are tagged  using  the
       same  tag key . You can specify up to 500 Amazon Web Services CloudFor-
       mation stacks.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-resource-collection is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing  query  expressions:  ResourceCollection.CloudFormation.StackNames,
       ResourceCollection.Tags

SYNOPSIS
            get-resource-collection
          --resource-collection-type <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-collection-type (string)
          The type of Amazon Web Services resource collections to return.  The
          one valid value is CLOUD_FORMATION for Amazon Web Services CloudFor-
          mation stacks.

          Possible values:

          o AWS_CLOUD_FORMATION

          o AWS_SERVICE

          o AWS_TAGS

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ResourceCollection -> (structure)
          The requested list of Amazon Web Services resource collections.  The
          two  types of Amazon Web Services resource collections supported are
          Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks and  Amazon  Web  Services
          resources that contain the same Amazon Web Services tag. DevOps Guru
          can be configured to analyze the Amazon Web Services resources  that
          are  defined in the stacks or that are tagged using the same tag key
          . You can specify up  to  500  Amazon  Web  Services  CloudFormation
          stacks.

          CloudFormation -> (structure)
              Information about Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks. You
              can use up to 500 stacks to specify which  Amazon  Web  Services
              resources  in your account to analyze. For more information, see
              Stacks in the Amazon Web Services CloudFormation User Guide .

              StackNames -> (list)
                 An array of CloudFormation stack names.

                 (string)

          Tags -> (list)
              The Amazon Web Services tags used to filter the resources in the
              resource collection.

              Tags  help  you  identify  and organize your Amazon Web Services
              resources. Many Amazon Web Services services support tagging, so
              you can assign the same tag to resources from different services
              to indicate that the resources are related. For example, you can
              assign  the  same  tag to an Amazon DynamoDB table resource that
              you assign to an Lambda function.  For  more  information  about
              using tags, see the Tagging best practices whitepaper.

              Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

              o A  tag  key (for example, CostCenter , Environment , Project ,
                or Secret ). Tag keys are case-sensitive.

              o An  optional  field  known  as  a  tag  value  (for   example,
                111122223333  , Production , or a team name). Omitting the tag
                value is the same as using an empty string. Like  tag  keys  ,
                tag values are case-sensitive.

              Together these are known as key -value pairs.

              WARNING:
                 The  string  used  for  a key in a tag that you use to define
                 your  resource  coverage   must   begin   with   the   prefix
                 Devops-guru-  .  The  tag  key  might  be Devops-guru-deploy-
                 ment-application or Devops-guru-rds-application . While  keys
                 are  case-sensitive,  the case of key characters don't matter
                 to DevOps Guru. For example, DevOps Guru  works  with  a  key
                 named  devops-guru-rds and a key named DevOps-Guru-RDS . Pos-
                 sible  key  /value  pairs  in  your  application   might   be
                 Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS or Devops-Guru-produc-
                 tion-application/containers .

              (structure)
                 A collection of Amazon  Web  Services  tags  used  to  filter
                 insights. This is used to return insights generated from only
                 resources that contain the tags in the tag collection.

                 AppBoundaryKey -> (string)
                     An Amazon Web Services tag key that is used  to  identify
                     the  Amazon  Web Services resources that DevOps Guru ana-
                     lyzes. All Amazon Web Services resources in your  account
                     and  Region tagged with this key make up your DevOps Guru
                     application and analysis boundary.

                     WARNING:
                        The string used for a key in a tag  that  you  use  to
                        define your resource coverage must begin with the pre-
                        fix   Devops-guru-   .   The   tag   key   might    be
                        Devops-guru-deployment-application                  or
                        Devops-guru-rds-application . While keys are case-sen-
                        sitive,  the  case  of  key characters don't matter to
                        DevOps Guru. For example, DevOps Guru works with a key
                        named  devops-guru-rds and a key named DevOps-Guru-RDS
                        . Possible key /value pairs in your application  might
                        be      Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS      or
                        Devops-Guru-production-application/containers .

                 TagValues -> (list)
                     The values in an Amazon Web Services tag collection.

                     The tag's value is an optional field used to associate  a
                     string with the tag key (for example, 111122223333 , Pro-
                     duction , or a team name). The  key  and  value  are  the
                     tag's  key  pair.  Omitting  the tag value is the same as
                     using an empty string. Like tag keys  ,  tag  values  are
                     case-sensitive.  You can specify a maximum of 256 charac-
                     ters for a tag value.

                     (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token to use to retrieve the next page of results for
          this operation. If there are no more pages, this value is null.
