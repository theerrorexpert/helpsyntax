NAME
       describe-account-overview -

DESCRIPTION
       For  the  time  range  passed  in,  returns the number of open reactive
       insight that were created, the number of open proactive  insights  that
       were  created, and the Mean Time to Recover (MTTR) for all closed reac-
       tive insights.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-account-overview
          --from-time <value>
          [--to-time <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --from-time (timestamp)
          The start of the time range passed in. The start time granularity is
          at  the  day  level.  The  floor of the start time is used. Returned
          information occurred after this day.

       --to-time (timestamp)
          The end of the time range passed in. The start time  granularity  is
          at  the  day  level.  The  floor of the start time is used. Returned
          information occurred before this day. If this is not specified, then
          the current day is used.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ReactiveInsights -> (integer)
          An  integer  that  specifies the number of open reactive insights in
          your Amazon Web Services account that were created during  the  time
          range passed in.

       ProactiveInsights -> (integer)
          An  integer  that specifies the number of open proactive insights in
          your Amazon Web Services account that were created during  the  time
          range passed in.

       MeanTimeToRecoverInMilliseconds -> (long)
          The  Mean  Time  to Recover (MTTR) for all closed insights that were
          created during the time range passed in.
