NAME
       devops-guru -

DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  DevOps  Guru is a fully managed service that helps you identify
       anomalous behavior in business critical operational  applications.  You
       specify  the Amazon Web Services resources that you want DevOps Guru to
       cover, then the Amazon  CloudWatch  metrics  and  Amazon  Web  Services
       CloudTrail  events related to those resources are analyzed. When anoma-
       lous behavior is detected, DevOps Guru creates an insight that includes
       recommendations,  related events, and related metrics that can help you
       improve your operational applications. For more information,  see  What
       is Amazon DevOps Guru .

       You can specify 1 or 2 Amazon Simple Notification Service topics so you
       are notified every time a new insight is created. You can  also  enable
       DevOps  Guru to generate an OpsItem in Amazon Web Services Systems Man-
       ager for each insight to help you manage and track your work addressing
       insights.
