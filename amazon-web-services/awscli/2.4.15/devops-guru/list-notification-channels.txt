NAME
       list-notification-channels -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of  notification channels configured for DevOps Guru.
       Each notification channel is used to notify you when DevOps Guru gener-
       ates  an  insight  that  contains information about how to improve your
       operations. The one supported notification  channel  is  Amazon  Simple
       Notification Service (Amazon SNS).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-notification-channels is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: Channels

SYNOPSIS
            list-notification-channels
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Channels -> (list)
          An array that contains the requested notification channels.

          (structure)
              Information about a notification channel. A notification channel
              is  used  to notify you when DevOps Guru creates an insight. The
              one supported notification channel is Amazon Simple Notification
              Service (Amazon SNS).

              If  you  use  an  Amazon  SNS topic in another account, you must
              attach a policy to it that grants DevOps Guru permission  to  it
              notifications.  DevOps  Guru  adds  the  required policy on your
              behalf to send notifications using Amazon SNS in  your  account.
              For  more  information, see Permissions for cross account Amazon
              SNS topics .

              If you use an Amazon SNS topic that is encrypted  by  an  Amazon
              Web  Services Key Management Service customer-managed key (CMK),
              then you must add permissions to the CMK. For more  information,
              see  Permissions for Amazon Web Services KMSencrypted Amazon SNS
              topics .

              Id -> (string)
                 The ID of a notification channel.

              Config -> (structure)
                 A NotificationChannelConfig object that contains  information
                 about configured notification channels.

                 Sns -> (structure)
                     Information  about  a  notification channel configured in
                     DevOps Guru to send notifications when insights are  cre-
                     ated.

                     If  you  use  an Amazon SNS topic in another account, you
                     must attach a policy to it that grants DevOps  Guru  per-
                     mission   to  it  notifications.  DevOps  Guru  adds  the
                     required policy on  your  behalf  to  send  notifications
                     using  Amazon  SNS in your account. For more information,
                     see Permissions for cross account Amazon SNS topics .

                     If you use an Amazon SNS topic that is  encrypted  by  an
                     Amazon  Web Services Key Management Service customer-man-
                     aged key (CMK), then you must add permissions to the CMK.
                     For more information, see Permissions for Amazon Web Ser-
                     vices KMSencrypted Amazon SNS topics .

                     TopicArn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  an  Amazon  Simple
                        Notification Service topic.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token to use to retrieve the next page of results for
          this operation. If there are no more pages, this value is null.
