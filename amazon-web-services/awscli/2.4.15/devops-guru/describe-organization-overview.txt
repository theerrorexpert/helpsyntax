SYNOPSIS
            describe-organization-overview
          --from-time <value>
          [--to-time <value>]
          [--account-ids <value>]
          [--organizational-unit-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --from-time (timestamp)
          The start of the time range passed in. The start time granularity is
          at the day level. The floor of the  start  time  is  used.  Returned
          information occurred after this day.

       --to-time (timestamp)
          The  end  of the time range passed in. The start time granularity is
          at the day level. The floor of the  start  time  is  used.  Returned
          information occurred before this day. If this is not specified, then
          the current day is used.

       --account-ids (list)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --organizational-unit-ids (list)
          The ID of the organizational unit.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
