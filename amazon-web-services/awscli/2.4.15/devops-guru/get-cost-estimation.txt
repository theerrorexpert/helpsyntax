NAME
       get-cost-estimation -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns an estimate of the monthly cost for DevOps Guru to analyze your
       Amazon Web Services resources. For more information, see Estimate  your
       Amazon DevOps Guru costs and Amazon DevOps Guru pricing .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-cost-estimation is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Costs

SYNOPSIS
            get-cost-estimation
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ResourceCollection -> (structure)
          The collection of the Amazon Web Services resources used  to  create
          your monthly DevOps Guru cost estimate.

          CloudFormation -> (structure)
              An  object  that specifies the CloudFormation stack that defines
              the Amazon Web Services resources used to create a monthly esti-
              mate for DevOps Guru.

              StackNames -> (list)
                 An  array of CloudFormation stack names. Its size is fixed at
                 1 item.

                 (string)

          Tags -> (list)
              The Amazon Web Services tags used to filter the resource collec-
              tion that is used for a cost estimate.

              Tags  help  you  identify  and organize your Amazon Web Services
              resources. Many Amazon Web Services services support tagging, so
              you can assign the same tag to resources from different services
              to indicate that the resources are related. For example, you can
              assign  the  same  tag to an Amazon DynamoDB table resource that
              you assign to an Lambda function.  For  more  information  about
              using tags, see the Tagging best practices whitepaper.

              Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

              o A  tag  key (for example, CostCenter , Environment , Project ,
                or Secret ). Tag keys are case-sensitive.

              o An  optional  field  known  as  a  tag  value  (for   example,
                111122223333  , Production , or a team name). Omitting the tag
                value is the same as using an empty string. Like  tag  keys  ,
                tag values are case-sensitive.

              Together these are known as key -value pairs.

              WARNING:
                 The  string  used  for  a key in a tag that you use to define
                 your  resource  coverage   must   begin   with   the   prefix
                 Devops-guru-  .  The  tag  key  might  be Devops-guru-deploy-
                 ment-application or Devops-guru-rds-application . While  keys
                 are  case-sensitive,  the case of key characters don't matter
                 to DevOps Guru. For example, DevOps Guru  works  with  a  key
                 named  devops-guru-rds and a key named DevOps-Guru-RDS . Pos-
                 sible  key  /value  pairs  in  your  application   might   be
                 Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS or Devops-Guru-produc-
                 tion-application/containers .

              (structure)
                 Information  about  a  collection  of  Amazon  Web   Services
                 resources  that are identified by an Amazon Web Services tag.
                 This collection of resources is used to create a monthly cost
                 estimate  for  DevOps  Guru  to  analyze  Amazon Web Services
                 resources. The maximum number of tags you can specify  for  a
                 cost estimate is one. The estimate created is for the cost to
                 analyze the Amazon Web Services resources defined by the tag.
                 For  more  information, see Stacks in the Amazon Web Services
                 CloudFormation User Guide .

                 AppBoundaryKey -> (string)
                     An Amazon Web Services tag key that is used  to  identify
                     the  Amazon  Web Services resources that DevOps Guru ana-
                     lyzes. All Amazon Web Services resources in your  account
                     and  Region tagged with this key make up your DevOps Guru
                     application and analysis boundary.

                     WARNING:
                        The string used for a key in a tag  that  you  use  to
                        define your resource coverage must begin with the pre-
                        fix   Devops-guru-   .   The   tag   key   might    be
                        Devops-guru-deployment-application                  or
                        Devops-guru-rds-application . While keys are case-sen-
                        sitive,  the  case  of  key characters don't matter to
                        DevOps Guru. For example, DevOps Guru works with a key
                        named  devops-guru-rds and a key named DevOps-Guru-RDS
                        . Possible key /value pairs in your application  might
                        be      Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS      or
                        Devops-Guru-production-application/containers .

                 TagValues -> (list)
                     The values in an Amazon Web Services tag collection.

                     The tag's value is an optional field used to associate  a
                     string with the tag key (for example, 111122223333 , Pro-
                     duction , or a team name). The  key  and  value  are  the
                     tag's  key  pair.  Omitting  the tag value is the same as
                     using an empty string. Like tag keys  ,  tag  values  are
                     case-sensitive.  You can specify a maximum of 256 charac-
                     ters for a tag value.

                     (string)

       Status -> (string)
          The status  of  creating  this  cost  estimate.  If  it's  still  in
          progress,  the  status  ONGOING  is returned. If it is finished, the
          status COMPLETED is returned.

       Costs -> (list)
          An array of ResourceCost objects that each  contains  details  about
          the monthly cost estimate to analyze one of your Amazon Web Services
          resources.

          (structure)
              An object that contains information about the estimated  monthly
              cost to analyze an Amazon Web Services resource. For more infor-
              mation, see Estimate your Amazon DevOps Guru  costs  and  Amazon
              DevOps Guru pricing .

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of the Amazon Web Services resource.

              State -> (string)
                 The  state of the resource. The resource is ACTIVE if it pro-
                 duces metrics, events, or logs within an hour,  otherwise  it
                 is  INACTIVE  .  You  pay for the number of active Amazon Web
                 Services resource hours analyzed for each resource.  Inactive
                 resources are not charged.

              Count -> (integer)
                 The  number  of active resources analyzed for this service to
                 create a monthly cost estimate.

              UnitCost -> (double)
                 The price per hour to analyze the resources in  the  service.

          The start and end time of the cost estimation.

          StartTime -> (timestamp)
              The start time of the cost estimation.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The end time of the cost estimation.

       TotalCost -> (double)
          The  estimated  monthly  cost  to  analyze  the  Amazon Web Services
          resources. This value is the sum of the estimated costs  to  analyze
          each resource in the Costs object in this response.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token to use to retrieve the next page of results for
          this operation. If there are no more pages, this value is null.
