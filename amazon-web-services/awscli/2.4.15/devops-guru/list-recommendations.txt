LIST-RECOMMENDATIONS()                                  LIST-RECOMMENDATIONS()



NAME
       list-recommendations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of a specified insight's recommendations. Each recommen-
       dation includes a list of related metrics and a list of related events.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-recommendations  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Recommendations

SYNOPSIS
            list-recommendations
          --insight-id <value>
          [--locale <value>]
          [--account-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --insight-id (string)
          The ID of the requested insight.

       --locale (string)
          A locale that specifies the language to use for recommendations.

          Possible values:

          o DE_DE

          o EN_US

          o EN_GB

          o ES_ES

          o FR_FR

          o IT_IT

          o JA_JP

          o KO_KR

          o PT_BR

          o ZH_CN

          o ZH_TW

       --account-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
