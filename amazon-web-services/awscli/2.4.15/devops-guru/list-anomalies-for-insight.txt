LIST-ANOMALIES-FOR-INSIGHT()                      LIST-ANOMALIES-FOR-INSIGHT()



NAME
       list-anomalies-for-insight -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of  the  anomalies that belong to an insight that you
       specify using its ID.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-anomalies-for-insight is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: ReactiveAnomalies, ProactiveAnomalies

SYNOPSIS
            list-anomalies-for-insight
          --insight-id <value>
          [--start-time-range <value>]
          [--account-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --insight-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the  insight.  The  returned  anomalies  belong to this
          insight.

       --start-time-range (structure)
          A time range used to specify when the requested  anomalies  started.
          All returned anomalies started during this time range.

          FromTime -> (timestamp)
              The start time of the time range.

          ToTime -> (timestamp)
              The end time of the time range.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FromTime=timestamp,ToTime=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "FromTime": timestamp,
            "ToTime": timestamp
          }

       --account-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT

                     The time range during which a metric limit is expected to
                     be exceeded. This applies to proactive insights only.

                 EndTime -> (timestamp)
                     The time when the behavior  in  a  proactive  insight  is

                     (structure)
                        Details about Performance Insights metrics.

                        Amazon RDS Performance Insights enables you to monitor
                        and  explore  different  dimensions  of  database load
                        based on data captured from a running DB instance.  DB
                        load  is  measured as average active sessions. Perfor-
                        mance Insights provides the data to API consumers as a
                        two-dimensional  time-series  dataset. The time dimen-
                        sion provides DB load data for each time point in  the
                        queried time range. Each time point decomposes overall
                        load in relation to the requested dimensions, measured
                        at  that time point. Examples include SQL, Wait event,
                        User, and Host.

                        MetricDisplayName -> (string)
                            The name used for a specific Performance  Insights
                            metric.

                        Unit -> (string)
                            The  unit  of measure for a metric. For example, a
                            session or a process.

                        MetricQuery -> (structure)
                            A single query to be processed for the metric. For
                            more          information,          see         ``
                            PerformanceInsightsMetricQuery `` .

                            Metric -> (string)
                               The name of the meteric used used when querying
                               an  Performance Insights GetResourceMetrics API
                               for anomaly metrics.

                               Valid values for Metric are:

                               o db.load.avg - a scaled representation of  the
                                 number  of  active  sessions for the database
                                 engine.

                               o db.sampledload.avg - the raw number of active
                                 sessions for the database engine.

                               If  the  number of active sessions is less than
                               an  internal  Performance  Insights  threshold,
                               db.load.avg and db.sampledload.avg are the same
                               value. If the  number  of  active  sessions  is
                               greater  than  the  internal threshold, Perfor-
                               mance Insights  samples  the  active  sessions,
                               with  db.load.avg  showing  the  scaled values,
                               db.sampledload.avg showing the raw values,  and
                               db.sampledload.avg  less than db.load.avg . For
                               most use cases, you can query db.load.avg only.

                            GroupBy -> (structure)
                               The specification for how to aggregate the data
                               points from a Performance Insights GetResource-
                               Metrics  API  query.  The  Performance Insights
                               query returns all of the dimensions within that
                               group, unless you provide the names of specific
                               dimensions within  that  group.  You  can  also
                               request that Performance Insights return a lim-
                               ited number of values for a dimension.

                               Group -> (string)
                                   The name of the dimension group. Its  valid
                                   values are:

              ResourceCollection -> (structure)
                 A collection of Amazon Web Services  resources  supported  by
                 DevOps  Guru.  The  two types of Amazon Web Services resource
                 collections supported are Amazon Web Services  CloudFormation
                 stacks  and  Amazon  Web  Services resources that contain the
                 same Amazon Web Services tag. DevOps Guru can  be  configured
                 to analyze the Amazon Web Services resources that are defined
                 in the stacks or that are tagged using the same tag key . You
                 can  specify  up  to  500  Amazon Web Services CloudFormation
                 stacks.

                 CloudFormation -> (structure)
                     An array of the names of Amazon Web Services  CloudForma-
                     tion  stacks.  The  stacks  define  Amazon  Web  Services
                     resources that DevOps Guru analyzes. You can  specify  up
                     to 500 Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks.

                     StackNames -> (list)
                        An array of CloudFormation stack names.

                        (string)

                 Tags -> (list)
                     The  Amazon  Web Services tags that are used by resources
                     in the resource collection.

                     Tags help you identify and organize your Amazon Web  Ser-
                     vices  resources.  Many Amazon Web Services services sup-
                     port tagging, so you can assign the same tag to resources
                     from  different  services  to indicate that the resources
                     are related. For example, you can assign the same tag  to
                     an  Amazon  DynamoDB table resource that you assign to an
                     Lambda function. For more information about  using  tags,
                     see the Tagging best practices whitepaper.

                     Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

                     o A  tag  key  (for  example,  CostCenter , Environment ,
                       Project , or Secret ). Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                     o An optional field known as a tag  value  (for  example,
                       111122223333  ,  Production , or a team name). Omitting
                       the tag value is the same as  using  an  empty  string.
                       Like tag keys , tag values are case-sensitive.

                        The  string  used  for  a key in a tag that you use to
                        define your resource coverage must begin with the pre-
                        fix    Devops-guru-   .   The   tag   key   might   be
                        Devops-guru-deployment-application                  or
                        Devops-guru-rds-application . While keys are case-sen-
                        sitive, the case of key  characters  don't  matter  to
                        DevOps Guru. For example, DevOps Guru works with a key
                        named devops-guru-rds and a key named  DevOps-Guru-RDS
                        .  Possible key /value pairs in your application might

                     (structure)
                        A collection of Amazon Web Services stags.

                        Tags  help  you  identify and organize your Amazon Web
                        Services resources. Many Amazon Web Services  services
                        support  tagging,  so  you  can assign the same tag to
                        resources from different services to indicate that the
                        resources are related. For example, you can assign the
                        same tag to an Amazon DynamoDB table resource that you
                        assign  to  an  Lambda  function. For more information
                        about using  tags,  see  the  Tagging  best  practices
                        whitepaper.

                        Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

                        o A  tag  key (for example, CostCenter , Environment ,
                          Project , or Secret ). Tag keys are  case-sensitive.

                        o An optional field known as a tag value (for example,
                          111122223333 , Production , or a team  name).  Omit-
                          ting  the  tag  value  is the same as using an empty
                          string. Like tag keys , tag values  are  case-sensi-
                          tive.

                            111122223333 , Production , or a team  name).  The
                            key and value are the tag's key pair. Omitting the
                            tag value is the same as using  an  empty  string.
                            Like tag keys , tag values are case-sensitive. You
                            can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a  tag

                        Amazon RDS Performance Insights enables you to monitor
                        and  explore  different  dimensions  of  database load
                        based on data captured from a running DB instance.  DB
                        load  is  measured as average active sessions. Perfor-
                        mance Insights provides the data to API consumers as a
                        two-dimensional  time-series  dataset. The time dimen-
                        sion provides DB load data for each time point in  the
                        queried time range. Each time point decomposes overall
                        load in relation to the requested dimensions, measured
                        at  that time point. Examples include SQL, Wait event,
                        User, and Host.

                               Valid values for Metric are:

                               o db.load.avg - a scaled representation of  the
                                 number  of  active  sessions for the database
                                 engine.

                               o db.sampledload.avg - the raw number of active
                                 sessions for the database engine.

                               If  the  number of active sessions is less than
                               an  internal  Performance  Insights  threshold,
                               db.load.avg and db.sampledload.avg are the same
                               value. If the  number  of  active  sessions  is
                               greater  than  the  internal threshold, Perfor-

                               Value -> (double)
                                   The value of the statistic.

              AssociatedInsightId -> (string)
                 The  ID of the insight that contains this anomaly. An insight
                 is composed of related anomalies.

              ResourceCollection -> (structure)
                 A collection of Amazon Web Services  resources  supported  by
                 DevOps  Guru.  The  two types of Amazon Web Services resource
                 collections supported are Amazon Web Services  CloudFormation
                 stacks  and  Amazon  Web  Services resources that contain the
                 same Amazon Web Services tag. DevOps Guru can  be  configured
                 to analyze the Amazon Web Services resources that are defined
                 in the stacks or that are tagged using the same tag key . You
                 can  specify  up  to  500  Amazon Web Services CloudFormation
                 stacks.

                 CloudFormation -> (structure)
                     An array of the names of Amazon Web Services  CloudForma-
                     tion  stacks.  The  stacks  define  Amazon  Web  Services
                     resources that DevOps Guru analyzes. You can  specify  up
                     to 500 Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks.

                     StackNames -> (list)
                        An array of CloudFormation stack names.

                        (string)

                 Tags -> (list)
                     The  Amazon  Web Services tags that are used by resources
                     in the resource collection.

                     Tags help you identify and organize your Amazon Web  Ser-
                     vices  resources.  Many Amazon Web Services services sup-
                     port tagging, so you can assign the same tag to resources
                     from  different  services  to indicate that the resources
                     are related. For example, you can assign the same tag  to
                     an  Amazon  DynamoDB table resource that you assign to an
                     Lambda function. For more information about  using  tags,
                     see the Tagging best practices whitepaper.

                     Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

                     o A  tag  key  (for  example,  CostCenter , Environment ,
                       Project , or Secret ). Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                     o An optional field known as a tag  value  (for  example,
                       111122223333  ,  Production , or a team name). Omitting
                       the tag value is the same as  using  an  empty  string.
                       Like tag keys , tag values are case-sensitive.

                     Together these are known as key -value pairs.

                     WARNING:
                        The  string  used  for  a key in a tag that you use to
                        define your resource coverage must begin with the pre-
                        fix    Devops-guru-   .   The   tag   key   might   be
                        Devops-guru-deployment-application                  or
                        Devops-guru-rds-application . While keys are case-sen-
                        sitive, the case of key  characters  don't  matter  to
                        DevOps Guru. For example, DevOps Guru works with a key
                        named devops-guru-rds and a key named  DevOps-Guru-RDS
                        .  Possible key /value pairs in your application might
                        be      Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS      or
                        Devops-Guru-production-application/containers .

                        Tags  help  you  identify and organize your Amazon Web
                        Services resources. Many Amazon Web Services  services
                        support  tagging,  so  you  can assign the same tag to
                        resources from different services to indicate that the
                        resources are related. For example, you can assign the
                        same tag to an Amazon DynamoDB table resource that you
                        assign  to  an  Lambda  function. For more information
                        about using  tags,  see  the  Tagging  best  practices
