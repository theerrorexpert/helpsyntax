DESCRIBE-INSIGHT()                                          DESCRIBE-INSIGHT()



NAME
       describe-insight -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns details about an insight that you specify using its ID.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-insight
          --id <value>
          [--account-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The ID of the insight.

       --account-id (string)
          The ID of the member account in the organization.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          ResourceCollection -> (structure)
              A  collection  of  Amazon  Web  Services  resources supported by
              DevOps Guru. The two types of Amazon Web Services resource  col-
              lections supported are Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks
              and Amazon Web Services resources that contain the  same  Amazon
              Web  Services  tag. DevOps Guru can be configured to analyze the
              Amazon Web Services resources that are defined in the stacks  or
              that  are  tagged using the same tag key . You can specify up to
              500 Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks.

              CloudFormation -> (structure)
                 An array of the names of Amazon Web  Services  CloudFormation
                 stacks.  The stacks define Amazon Web Services resources that
                 DevOps Guru analyzes. You can specify up to  500  Amazon  Web
                 Services CloudFormation stacks.

                 StackNames -> (list)
                     An array of CloudFormation stack names.

                     (string)

              Tags -> (list)
                 The  Amazon  Web  Services tags that are used by resources in
                 the resource collection.

                 Tags help you identify and organize your Amazon Web  Services
                 resources. Many Amazon Web Services services support tagging,
                 so you can assign the same tag to  resources  from  different
                 services  to  indicate  that  the  resources are related. For
                 example, you can assign the same tag to  an  Amazon  DynamoDB
                 table  resource  that  you  assign to an Lambda function. For
                 more information about using tags, see the Tagging best prac-
                 tices whitepaper.

                 Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

                 o A  tag key (for example, CostCenter , Environment , Project
                   , or Secret ). Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                 o An optional field  known  as  a  tag  value  (for  example,
                   111122223333  ,  Production , or a team name). Omitting the
                   tag value is the same as using an empty  string.  Like  tag
                   keys , tag values are case-sensitive.

                 Together these are known as key -value pairs.

                 WARNING:
                     The string used for a key in a tag that you use to define
                     your  resource  coverage  must  begin  with  the   prefix
                     Devops-guru-  .  The tag key might be Devops-guru-deploy-
                     ment-application or Devops-guru-rds-application  .  While
                     keys are case-sensitive, the case of key characters don't
                     matter to DevOps Guru. For  example,  DevOps  Guru  works
                     with   a  key  named  devops-guru-rds  and  a  key  named
                     DevOps-Guru-RDS .  Possible  key  /value  pairs  in  your
                     application   might   be  Devops-Guru-production-applica-
                     tion/RDS or Devops-Guru-production-application/containers
                     .

                        . Possible key /value pairs in your application  might
                        be      Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS      or

                        tify  the  Amazon  Web  Services resources that DevOps
                        Guru analyzes. All Amazon Web  Services  resources  in
                        your  account  and Region tagged with this key make up
                        your DevOps Guru application and analysis boundary.

                        WARNING:
                            The string used for a key in a tag that you use to

                     TagValues -> (list)
                        The values in an Amazon Web Services tag collection.

                        The tag's value is an optional field used to associate
                        a string with the tag key (for example, 111122223333 ,
                        Production  ,  or  a team name). The key and value are
                        the tag's key pair. Omitting the tag value is the same
                        as  using  an empty string. Like tag keys , tag values
                        are case-sensitive. You can specify a maximum  of  256
                        characters for a tag value.

                        tify the Amazon Web  Services  resources  that  DevOps
                        Guru  analyzes.  All  Amazon Web Services resources in
                        your account and Region tagged with this key  make  up
                        your DevOps Guru application and analysis boundary.

                        WARNING:
                            The string used for a key in a tag that you use to
                            define your resource coverage must begin with  the
                            prefix   Devops-guru-  .  The  tag  key  might  be
                            Devops-guru-deployment-application              or
                            Devops-guru-rds-application   .   While  keys  are
                            case-sensitive, the case of key  characters  don't
                            matter  to  DevOps  Guru. For example, DevOps Guru
                            works with a key named devops-guru-rds and  a  key
                            named  DevOps-Guru-RDS . Possible key /value pairs
                            in your application might  be  Devops-Guru-produc-
                            tion-application/RDS     or    Devops-Guru-produc-
                            tion-application/containers .

                     TagValues -> (list)
                        The values in an Amazon Web Services tag collection.

                        The tag's value is an optional field used to associate
                        a string with the tag key (for example, 111122223333 ,
                        Production , or a team name). The key  and  value  are
                        the tag's key pair. Omitting the tag value is the same
                        as using an empty string. Like tag keys ,  tag  values
                        are  case-sensitive.  You can specify a maximum of 256
                        characters for a tag value.
