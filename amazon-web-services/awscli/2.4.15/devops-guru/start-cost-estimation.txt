       start-cost-estimation -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  the creation of an estimate of the monthly cost to analyze your

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-cost-estimation
          --resource-collection <value>
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-collection (structure)
          The collection of Amazon Web Services resources  used  to  create  a
          monthly DevOps Guru cost estimate.

          CloudFormation -> (structure)
              An  object  that specifies the CloudFormation stack that defines
              the Amazon Web Services resources used to create a monthly esti-
              mate for DevOps Guru.

              StackNames -> (list)
                 An  array of CloudFormation stack names. Its size is fixed at
                 1 item.

                 (string)

          Tags -> (list)
              The Amazon Web Services tags used to filter the resource collec-
              tion that is used for a cost estimate.

              Tags  help  you  identify  and organize your Amazon Web Services
              resources. Many Amazon Web Services services support tagging, so
              you can assign the same tag to resources from different services
              to indicate that the resources are related. For example, you can
              assign  the  same  tag to an Amazon DynamoDB table resource that
              you assign to an Lambda function.  For  more  information  about
              using tags, see the Tagging best practices whitepaper.

              Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

              o A  tag  key (for example, CostCenter , Environment , Project ,
                or Secret ). Tag keys are case-sensitive.

              o An  optional  field  known  as  a  tag  value  (for   example,
                111122223333  , Production , or a team name). Omitting the tag
                value is the same as using an empty string. Like  tag  keys  ,
                tag values are case-sensitive.

              Together these are known as key -value pairs.

              WARNING:
                 The  string  used  for  a key in a tag that you use to define
                 your  resource  coverage   must   begin   with   the   prefix
                 Devops-guru-  .  The  tag  key  might  be Devops-guru-deploy-
                 ment-application or Devops-guru-rds-application . While  keys
                 are  case-sensitive,  the case of key characters don't matter
                 to DevOps Guru. For example, DevOps Guru  works  with  a  key
                 named  devops-guru-rds and a key named DevOps-Guru-RDS . Pos-
                 sible  key  /value  pairs  in  your  application   might   be
                 Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS or Devops-Guru-produc-
                 tion-application/containers .

              (structure)
                 Information  about  a  collection  of  Amazon  Web   Services
                 resources  that are identified by an Amazon Web Services tag.
                 This collection of resources is used to create a monthly cost
                 estimate  for  DevOps  Guru  to  analyze  Amazon Web Services
                 resources. The maximum number of tags you can specify  for  a
                 cost estimate is one. The estimate created is for the cost to
                 analyze the Amazon Web Services resources defined by the tag.
                 For  more  information, see Stacks in the Amazon Web Services
                 CloudFormation User Guide .

                 AppBoundaryKey -> (string)
                     An Amazon Web Services tag key that is used  to  identify
                     the  Amazon  Web Services resources that DevOps Guru ana-
                     lyzes. All Amazon Web Services resources in your  account
                     and  Region tagged with this key make up your DevOps Guru
                     application and analysis boundary.

                     WARNING:
                        The string used for a key in a tag  that  you  use  to
                        define your resource coverage must begin with the pre-
                        fix   Devops-guru-   .   The   tag   key   might    be
                        Devops-guru-deployment-application                  or
                        Devops-guru-rds-application . While keys are case-sen-
                        sitive,  the  case  of  key characters don't matter to
                        DevOps Guru. For example, DevOps Guru works with a key
                        named  devops-guru-rds and a key named DevOps-Guru-RDS
                        . Possible key /value pairs in your application  might
                        be      Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS      or
                        Devops-Guru-production-application/containers .

                 TagValues -> (list)
                     The values in an Amazon Web Services tag collection.

                     The tag's value is an optional field used to associate  a
                     string with the tag key (for example, 111122223333 , Pro-
                     duction , or a team name). The  key  and  value  are  the
                     tag's  key  pair.  Omitting  the tag value is the same as
                     using an empty string. Like tag keys  ,  tag  values  are
                     case-sensitive.  You can specify a maximum of 256 charac-
                     ters for a tag value.

                     (string)

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CloudFormation": {
              "StackNames": ["string", ...]
            },
            "Tags": [
              {
                "AppBoundaryKey": "string",
                "TagValues": ["string", ...]
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --client-token (string)
          The idempotency token used to identify each cost estimate request.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
