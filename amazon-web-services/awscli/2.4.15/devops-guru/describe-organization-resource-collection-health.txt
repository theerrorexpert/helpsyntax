NAME
       describe-organization-resource-collection-health -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  an  overview  of  your  system's health. If additional member
       accounts are part of your organization, you can filter  those  accounts
       using the AccountIds field.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-organization-resource-collection-health  is a paginated opera-
       tion. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the  entire
       data  set  of  results.  You  can  disable  pagination by providing the
       --no-paginate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argu-
       ment  on  a  paginated response, the --query argument must extract data
       from the results of the following  query  expressions:  CloudFormation,
       Account, Service, Tags

SYNOPSIS
            describe-organization-resource-collection-health
          --organization-resource-collection-type <value>
          [--account-ids <value>]
          [--organizational-unit-ids <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --organization-resource-collection-type (string)
          An Amazon Web Services resource collection type. This type specifies
          how analyzed Amazon Web Services  resources  are  defined.  The  two
          types of Amazon Web Services resource collections supported are Ama-
          zon Web Services  CloudFormation  stacks  and  Amazon  Web  Services
          resources that contain the same Amazon Web Services tag. DevOps Guru
          can be configured to analyze the Amazon Web Services resources  that
          are  defined in the stacks or that are tagged using the same tag key
          . You can specify up  to  500  Amazon  Web  Services  CloudFormation
          stacks.

          Possible values:

          o AWS_CLOUD_FORMATION

          o AWS_SERVICE

          o AWS_ACCOUNT

          o AWS_TAGS

       --account-ids (list)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --organizational-unit-ids (list)
          The ID of the organizational unit.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  results  to  return with a single call. To
          retrieve the remaining results, make another call with the  returned
          nextToken value.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       Tags -> (list)
          Tags help  you  identify  and  organize  your  Amazon  Web  Services
          resources. Many Amazon Web Services services support tagging, so you
          can assign the same tag to  resources  from  different  services  to
          indicate that the resources are related. For example, you can assign
          the same tag to an Amazon DynamoDB table resource that you assign to
          an  Lambda  function. For more information about using tags, see the
          Tagging best practices whitepaper.

          Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

          o A tag key (for example, CostCenter , Environment ,  Project  ,  or
            Secret ). Tag keys are case-sensitive.

          o An  optional field known as a tag value (for example, 111122223333
            , Production , or a team name). Omitting the tag value is the same
            as using an empty string. Like tag keys , tag values are case-sen-
            sitive.

          Together these are known as key -value pairs.

          WARNING:
              The string used for a key in a tag that you use to  define  your
              resource  coverage must begin with the prefix Devops-guru- . The
              tag   key   might   be   Devops-guru-deployment-application   or
              Devops-guru-rds-application . While keys are case-sensitive, the
              case of key characters don't matter to DevOps Guru. For example,
              DevOps  Guru  works  with  a key named devops-guru-rds and a key
              named DevOps-Guru-RDS . Possible key /value pairs in your appli-
              cation   might   be   Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS  or
              Devops-Guru-production-application/containers .

          (structure)
              Information about the health of Amazon Web Services resources in
              your  account  that  are specified by an Amazon Web Services tag
              key .

              AppBoundaryKey -> (string)
                 An Amazon Web Services tag key that is used to  identify  the
                 Amazon  Web Services resources that DevOps Guru analyzes. All
                 Amazon Web Services resources  in  your  account  and  Region
                 tagged with this key make up your DevOps Guru application and
                 analysis boundary.

                 WARNING:
                     The string used for a key in a tag that you use to define
                     your   resource  coverage  must  begin  with  the  prefix
                     Devops-guru- . The tag key might  be  Devops-guru-deploy-
                     ment-application  or  Devops-guru-rds-application . While
                     keys are case-sensitive, the case of key characters don't
                     matter  to  DevOps  Guru.  For example, DevOps Guru works
                     with  a  key  named  devops-guru-rds  and  a  key   named
                     DevOps-Guru-RDS  .  Possible  key  /value  pairs  in your
                     application  might   be   Devops-Guru-production-applica-
                     tion/RDS or Devops-Guru-production-application/containers
                     .

              TagValue -> (string)
                 The value in an Amazon Web Services tag.

                 The tag's value is an optional  field  used  to  associate  a
                 string  with the tag key (for example, 111122223333 , Produc-
                 tion , or a team name). The key and value are the  tag's  key
                 pair.  Omitting  the  tag value is the same as using an empty
                 string. Like tag keys , tag values  are  case-sensitive.  You
                 can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag value.

              Insight -> (structure)
                 Information  about  the  health  of  the  Amazon Web Services
                 resources in your account that are specified by an Amazon Web
                 Services  tag,  including  the number of open proactive, open
                 reactive insights, and the Mean Time  to  Recover  (MTTR)  of
                 closed insights.

                 OpenProactiveInsights -> (integer)
                     The number of open proactive insights.

                 OpenReactiveInsights -> (integer)
                     The number of open reactive insights.

                 MeanTimeToRecoverInMilliseconds -> (long)
                     The Meant Time to Recover (MTTR) for the insight.
