NAME
       describe-anomaly -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns details about an anomaly that you specify using its ID.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-anomaly
          --id <value>
          [--account-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The ID of the anomaly.

       --account-id (string)
          The ID of the member account.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT

                 (structure)
                     Details about Performance Insights metrics.

                     Amazon RDS Performance Insights enables  you  to  monitor
                     and  explore  different dimensions of database load based
                     on data captured from a running DB instance. DB  load  is
                     measured as average active sessions. Performance Insights
                     provides the data to API consumers as  a  two-dimensional
                     time-series  dataset. The time dimension provides DB load
                     data for each time point in the queried time range.  Each
                     time  point  decomposes  overall  load in relation to the
                     requested dimensions, measured at that time point.  Exam-
                     ples include SQL, Wait event, User, and Host.

                       DB instances, go to the Amazon RDS User Guide .

                     MetricDisplayName -> (string)
                        The name used for a specific Performance Insights met-
                        ric.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        The  unit of measure for a metric. For example, a ses-
                        sion or a process.

                     MetricQuery -> (structure)
                        A single query to be processed  for  the  metric.  For
                        more           information,           see           ``
                        PerformanceInsightsMetricQuery `` .

                        Metric -> (string)
                            The name of the meteric used used when querying an
                            Performance  Insights  GetResourceMetrics  API for
                            anomaly metrics.

                            Valid values for Metric are:

                            o db.load.avg - a  scaled  representation  of  the
                              number  of  active  sessions  for  the  database
                              engine.

                            o db.sampledload.avg - the raw  number  of  active
                              sessions for the database engine.

                            If  the  number of active sessions is less than an
                            internal    Performance    Insights     threshold,
                            db.load.avg  and  db.sampledload.avg  are the same
                            value. If the number of active sessions is greater
                            than  the internal threshold, Performance Insights
                            samples  the  active  sessions,  with  db.load.avg
                            showing   the  scaled  values,  db.sampledload.avg
                            showing the  raw  values,  and  db.sampledload.avg
                            less  than  db.load.avg  . For most use cases, you
                            can query db.load.avg only.

                        GroupBy -> (structure)
                            The specification for how to  aggregate  the  data
                            points from a Performance Insights GetResourceMet-
                            rics API query.  The  Performance  Insights  query
                            returns  all  of the dimensions within that group,
                            unless you provide the names  of  specific  dimen-
                            sions within that group. You can also request that
                            Performance Insights return a  limited  number  of
                            values for a dimension.

                            Group -> (string)
                               The name of the dimension group. Its valid val-
                               ues are:

                               group.  If  this parameter is not present, then
                               it signifies that all of the dimensions in  the
                               group  were  requested  or  are  present in the

          ResourceCollection -> (structure)
              A  collection  of  Amazon  Web  Services  resources supported by
              DevOps Guru. The two types of Amazon Web Services resource  col-
              lections supported are Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks
              and Amazon Web Services resources that contain the  same  Amazon
              Web  Services  tag. DevOps Guru can be configured to analyze the
              Amazon Web Services resources that are defined in the stacks  or
              that  are  tagged using the same tag key . You can specify up to
              500 Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks.

              CloudFormation -> (structure)
                 An array of the names of Amazon Web  Services  CloudFormation
                 stacks.  The stacks define Amazon Web Services resources that
                 DevOps Guru analyzes. You can specify up to  500  Amazon  Web
                 Services CloudFormation stacks.

                 StackNames -> (list)
                     An array of CloudFormation stack names.

                     (string)

              Tags -> (list)
                 The  Amazon  Web  Services tags that are used by resources in
                 the resource collection.

                 Tags help you identify and organize your Amazon Web  Services
                 resources. Many Amazon Web Services services support tagging,
                 so you can assign the same tag to  resources  from  different
                 services  to  indicate  that  the  resources are related. For
                 example, you can assign the same tag to  an  Amazon  DynamoDB
                 table  resource  that  you  assign to an Lambda function. For
                 more information about using tags, see the Tagging best prac-
                 tices whitepaper.

                 Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

                 o A  tag key (for example, CostCenter , Environment , Project
                   , or Secret ). Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                 o An optional field  known  as  a  tag  value  (for  example,
                   111122223333  ,  Production , or a team name). Omitting the
                   tag value is the same as using an empty  string.  Like  tag
                   keys , tag values are case-sensitive.

                 Together these are known as key -value pairs.

                 WARNING:
                     The string used for a key in a tag that you use to define
                     your  resource  coverage  must  begin  with  the   prefix
                     Devops-guru-  .  The tag key might be Devops-guru-deploy-
                     ment-application or Devops-guru-rds-application  .  While
                     keys are case-sensitive, the case of key characters don't
                     matter to DevOps Guru. For  example,  DevOps  Guru  works
                     with   a  key  named  devops-guru-rds  and  a  key  named
                     DevOps-Guru-RDS .  Possible  key  /value  pairs  in  your
                     application   might   be  Devops-Guru-production-applica-
                     tion/RDS or Devops-Guru-production-application/containers
                     .

                     Tags  help you identify and organize your Amazon Web Ser-
                     vices resources. Many Amazon Web Services  services  sup-
                     port tagging, so you can assign the same tag to resources
                     from different services to indicate  that  the  resources
                     are  related. For example, you can assign the same tag to
                     an Amazon DynamoDB table resource that you assign  to  an
                     Lambda  function.  For more information about using tags,

                        . Possible key /value pairs in your application  might
                        be      Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS      or
                        Devops-Guru-production-application/containers .

                     AppBoundaryKey -> (string)

                        tify  the  Amazon  Web  Services resources that DevOps
                        Guru analyzes. All Amazon Web  Services  resources  in
                        your  account  and Region tagged with this key make up

                     TagValues -> (list)
                        The values in an Amazon Web Services tag collection.

                        The tag's value is an optional field used to associate
                        a string with the tag key (for example, 111122223333 ,
                        Production  ,  or  a team name). The key and value are
                        the tag's key pair. Omitting the tag value is the same
                        as  using  an empty string. Like tag keys , tag values
                        are case-sensitive. You can specify a maximum  of  256
                        characters for a tag value.

                 (structure)
                     Details about Performance Insights metrics.

                     Amazon  RDS  Performance  Insights enables you to monitor
                     and explore different dimensions of database  load  based
                     on  data  captured from a running DB instance. DB load is
                     measured as average active sessions. Performance Insights
                     provides  the  data to API consumers as a two-dimensional
                     time-series dataset. The time dimension provides DB  load
                     data  for each time point in the queried time range. Each
                     time point decomposes overall load  in  relation  to  the
                     requested  dimensions, measured at that time point. Exam-
                     ples include SQL, Wait event, User, and Host.

                     MetricDisplayName -> (string)
                        The name used for a specific Performance Insights met-
                        ric.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        The unit of measure for a metric. For example, a  ses-
                        sion or a process.

                        A  single  query  to  be processed for the metric. For
                        more           information,           see           ``
                        PerformanceInsightsMetricQuery `` .

                        Metric -> (string)
                            The name of the meteric used used when querying an
                            Performance Insights  GetResourceMetrics  API  for
                            anomaly metrics.

                            Valid values for Metric are:

                            o db.load.avg  -  a  scaled  representation of the
                              number  of  active  sessions  for  the  database
                              engine.

                            o db.sampledload.avg  -  the  raw number of active
                              sessions for the database engine.

                            If the number of active sessions is less  than  an
                            internal     Performance    Insights    threshold,
                            db.load.avg and db.sampledload.avg  are  the  same
                            value. If the number of active sessions is greater
                            than the internal threshold, Performance  Insights
                            samples  the  active  sessions,  with  db.load.avg
                            showing  the  scaled  values,   db.sampledload.avg
                            showing  the  raw  values,  and db.sampledload.avg
                            less than db.load.avg . For most  use  cases,  you
                            can query db.load.avg only.

                        GroupBy -> (structure)

                            rics  API  query.  The  Performance Insights query
                            returns all of the dimensions within  that  group,
                            unless  you  provide  the names of specific dimen-
                            sions within that group. You can also request that
                            Performance  Insights  return  a limited number of
                            values for a dimension.

                            Group -> (string)
                               The name of the dimension group. Its valid val-

          ResourceCollection -> (structure)
              A collection of  Amazon  Web  Services  resources  supported  by
              DevOps  Guru. The two types of Amazon Web Services resource col-
              lections supported are Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks
              and  Amazon  Web Services resources that contain the same Amazon
              Web Services tag. DevOps Guru can be configured to  analyze  the
              Amazon  Web Services resources that are defined in the stacks or
              that are tagged using the same tag key . You can specify  up  to
              500 Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks.

              CloudFormation -> (structure)
                 An  array  of the names of Amazon Web Services CloudFormation
                 stacks. The stacks define Amazon Web Services resources  that
                 DevOps  Guru  analyzes.  You can specify up to 500 Amazon Web
                 Services CloudFormation stacks.

                 StackNames -> (list)
                     An array of CloudFormation stack names.

                     (string)

              Tags -> (list)
                 The Amazon Web Services tags that are used  by  resources  in
                 the resource collection.

                 Tags  help you identify and organize your Amazon Web Services
                 resources. Many Amazon Web Services services support tagging,
                 so  you  can  assign the same tag to resources from different
                 services to indicate that  the  resources  are  related.  For
                 example,  you  can  assign the same tag to an Amazon DynamoDB
                 table resource that you assign to  an  Lambda  function.  For
                 more information about using tags, see the Tagging best prac-
                 tices whitepaper.

                 Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

                 o A tag key (for example, CostCenter , Environment ,  Project
                   , or Secret ). Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                 o An  optional  field  known  as  a  tag  value (for example,
                   111122223333 , Production , or a team name).  Omitting  the
                   tag  value  is  the same as using an empty string. Like tag
                   keys , tag values are case-sensitive.

                 Together these are known as key -value pairs.

                 WARNING:
                     The string used for a key in a tag that you use to define
                     your   resource  coverage  must  begin  with  the  prefix
                     Devops-guru- . The tag key might  be  Devops-guru-deploy-
                     ment-application  or  Devops-guru-rds-application . While
                     keys are case-sensitive, the case of key characters don't
                     matter  to  DevOps  Guru.  For example, DevOps Guru works
                     with  a  key  named  devops-guru-rds  and  a  key   named
                     DevOps-Guru-RDS  .  Possible  key  /value  pairs  in your
                     application  might   be   Devops-Guru-production-applica-
                     tion/RDS or Devops-Guru-production-application/containers
                     .

                     Tags help you identify and organize your Amazon Web  Ser-
                     vices  resources.  Many Amazon Web Services services sup-
                     port tagging, so you can assign the same tag to resources
                     from  different  services  to indicate that the resources
                     are related. For example, you can assign the same tag  to
                     an  Amazon  DynamoDB table resource that you assign to an
                     Lambda function. For more information about  using  tags,

                        .  Possible key /value pairs in your application might
                        be      Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS      or

                        tify the Amazon Web  Services  resources  that  DevOps
                        Guru  analyzes.  All  Amazon Web Services resources in
                        your account and Region tagged with this key  make  up
                        your DevOps Guru application and analysis boundary.

                        WARNING:
                            The string used for a key in a tag that you use to

                     TagValues -> (list)
                        The values in an Amazon Web Services tag collection.

                        The tag's value is an optional field used to associate
                        a string with the tag key (for example, 111122223333 ,
                        Production , or a team name). The key  and  value  are
                        the tag's key pair. Omitting the tag value is the same
                        as using an empty string. Like tag keys ,  tag  values
                        are  case-sensitive.  You can specify a maximum of 256
                        characters for a tag value.

                        (string)

          Type -> (string)
              The type of the reactive anomaly. It can be one of the following
              types.

              o CAUSAL - the anomaly can cause a new insight.

              o CONTEXTUAL - the anomaly contains additional information about
                an insight or its causal anomaly.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the reactive anomaly.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the reactive anomaly.

          CausalAnomalyId -> (string)
              The ID of the causal anomaly that is associated with this  reac-
              tive anomaly. The ID of a CAUSAL anomaly is always NULL.

          AnomalyResources -> (list)
              The  Amazon  Web  Services resources in which anomalous behavior
              was detected by DevOps Guru.

                 The Amazon  Web  Services  resources  in  which  DevOps  Guru
                 detected  unusual behavior that resulted in the generation of
                 an anomaly. When DevOps Guru detects multiple  related  anom-
                 alies,  it  creates and insight with details about the anoma-
                 lous behavior and suggestions about how to correct the  prob-
                 lem.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name of the Amazon Web Services resource.
