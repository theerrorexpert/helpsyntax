SEARCH-JOBS()                                                    SEARCH-JOBS()



NAME
       search-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Searches for Amazon Braket jobs that match the specified filter values.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       search-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be  issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the  results  of  the  following  query
       expressions: jobs

SYNOPSIS
            search-jobs
          --filters <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          The filter values to use when searching for a job.

          (structure)
              A filter used to search for Amazon Braket jobs.

              name -> (string)
                 The name to use for the jobs filter.

              operator -> (string)
                 An operator to use for the jobs filter.

              values -> (list)
                 The values to use for the jobs filter.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,operator=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "operator": "LT"|"LTE"|"EQUAL"|"GT"|"GTE"|"BETWEEN"|"CONTAINS",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT

                 The date and time that the Amazon Braket job ended.

              jobArn -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          A  token  used  for  pagination  of results, or null if there are no
          additional results. Use the token value in a subsequent  request  to
          continue results where the previous request ended.
