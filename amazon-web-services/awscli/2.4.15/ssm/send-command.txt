OPTIONS
       --instance-ids (list)
          The  IDs of the managed nodes where the command should run. Specify-
          ing managed node IDs is most useful when you are targeting a limited
          number of managed nodes, though you can specify up to 50 IDs.

          To  target a larger number of managed nodes, or if you prefer not to
          list individual node IDs, we  recommend  using  the  Targets  option
          instead.  Using Targets , which accepts tag key-value pairs to iden-
          tify the managed nodes to send commands to, you can a  send  command
          to tens, hundreds, or thousands of nodes at once.

          For more information about how to use targets, see Using targets and
          rate controls to send commands to a fleet in the Amazon Web Services
          Systems Manager User Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --targets (list)
          An  array  of  search  criteria  that  targets managed nodes using a
          Key,Value combination that you specify. Specifying targets  is  most
          useful  when you want to send a command to a large number of managed
          nodes at once. Using Targets , which accepts tag key-value pairs  to
          identify managed nodes, you can send a command to tens, hundreds, or
          thousands of nodes at once.

          To send a command to a smaller number of managed nodes, you can  use
          the InstanceIds option instead.

          For  more information about how to use targets, see Sending commands
          to a fleet in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide .

          (structure)
              An array of search criteria that targets managed nodes  using  a
              key-value pair that you specify.

              NOTE:
                 One  or more targets must be specified for maintenance window
                 Run Command-type tasks. Depending on the  task,  targets  are
                 optional for other maintenance window task types (Automation,
                 Lambda, and Step Functions). For more information about  run-
                 ning  tasks that don't specify targets, see Registering main-
                 tenance window tasks without targets in the Amazon  Web  Ser-
                 vices Systems Manager User Guide .

              Supported formats include the following.

              o Key=InstanceIds,Val-
                ues=<instance-id-1>,<instance-id-2>,<instance-id-3>

              o Key=tag:<my-tag-key>,Values=<my-tag-value-1>,<my-tag-value-2>

              o Key=tag-key,Values=<my-tag-key-1>,<my-tag-key-2>

              o Run  Command   and   Maintenance   window   targets   only   :
                Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=<resource-group-name>

              o Maintenance         window        targets        only        :
                Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Val-
                ues=<resource-type-1>,<resource-type-2>

              o Automation     targets     only    :    Key=ResourceGroup;Val-
                ues=<resource-group-name>

              For example:

              o Key=InstanceIds,Values=i-02573cafcfEXAMPLE,i-0471e04240EXAM-
                PLE,i-07782c72faEXAMPLE

              o Key=tag:CostCenter,Values=CostCenter1,CostCenter2,CostCenter3

              o Key=tag-key,Values=Name,Instance-Type,CostCenter

              o Run   Command   and   Maintenance   window   targets   only  :
                Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=ProductionResourceGroup   This
                example  demonstrates  how  to  target  all  resources  in the
                resource group  ProductionResourceGroup  in  your  maintenance
                window.

              o Maintenance         window        targets        only        :
                Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Val-
                ues=AWS::EC2::INSTANCE,AWS::EC2::VPC     This  example  demon-
                strates how to target only Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud  (Ama-
                zon EC2) instances and VPCs in your maintenance window.

              o Automation targets only : Key=ResourceGroup,Values=MyResource-
                Group

              o State Manager association targets only :  Key=InstanceIds,Val-
                ues=*    This  example  demonstrates how to target all managed
                instances in the Amazon Web Services Region where the associa-
                tion was created.

              For more information about how to send commands that target man-
              aged nodes using Key,Value parameters,  see  Targeting  multiple
              instances  in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide
              .

              Key -> (string)
                 User-defined criteria for sending commands that  target  man-
                 aged nodes that meet the criteria.

              Values -> (list)
                 User-defined  criteria that maps to Key . For example, if you
                 specified tag:ServerRole , you could specify  value:WebServer
                 to  run  a  command  on  instances  that  include EC2 tags of
                 ServerRole,WebServer .

                 Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of values
                 for a key might be lower than the global maximum of 50.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --document-name (string)
          The  name  of  the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager document (SSM
          document) to run. This can be a public document or  a  custom  docu-
          ment. To run a shared document belonging to another account, specify
          the document Amazon Resource Name (ARN). For more information  about
          how  to  use shared documents, see Using shared SSM documents in the
          Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide .

          NOTE:
              If you specify a document name or ARN that  hasn't  been  shared
              with your account, you receive an InvalidDocument error.

       --document-version (string)
          The  SSM  document  version  to  use in the request. You can specify
          $DEFAULT, $LATEST, or a specific version number. If you run commands
          by  using the Command Line Interface (Amazon Web Services CLI), then
          you must escape the first two options by using a backslash.  If  you
          specify  a version number, then you don't need to use the backslash.
          For example: -- document-version "$DEFAULT"
          --document-version "$LATEST" -- document-version "3"

       --document-hash (string)
          The Sha256 or Sha1 hash created by the system when the document  was
          created.

              Sha1 hashes have been deprecated.

       --document-hash-type (string)
          Sha256 or Sha1.

          NOTE:
              Sha1 hashes have been deprecated.

          Possible values:

          o Sha256

          o Sha1

       --timeout-seconds (integer)
          If  this time is reached and the command hasn't already started run-
          ning, it won't run.

       --comment (string)
          User-specified information  about  the  command,  such  as  a  brief
          description of what the command should do.

       --parameters (map)
          The required and optional parameters specified in the document being
          run.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,string,KeyName2=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": ["string", ...]
            ...}

       --output-s3-region (string)
          (Deprecated) You can no longer specify this  parameter.  The  system
          ignores  it.  Instead,  Systems Manager automatically determines the
          Amazon Web Services Region of the S3 bucket.

       --output-s3-bucket-name (string)
          The name of the S3 bucket where command execution  responses  should
          be stored.

       --output-s3-key-prefix (string)
          The  directory  structure  within  the S3 bucket where the responses
          should be stored.

       --max-concurrency (string)
          (Optional) The maximum number of managed nodes that are  allowed  to
          run  the  command at the same time. You can specify a number such as
          10 or a percentage such as 10%. The default value is 50 .  For  more
          information  about how to use MaxConcurrency , see Using concurrency
          controls in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide .

       --max-errors (string)
          The maximum number of errors allowed without  the  command  failing.
          When the command fails one more time beyond the value of MaxErrors ,
          the systems stops sending the command to additional targets. You can
          specify a number like 10 or a percentage like 10%. The default value
          is 0 . For more information about how to use MaxErrors ,  see  Using
          error controls in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide
          .

       --service-role-arn (string)
          The ARN of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) service role  to
          use to publish Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) noti-
          fications for Run Command commands.

       --notification-config (structure)
          Configurations for sending notifications.

          NotificationArn -> (string)
              An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for an Amazon Simple  Notification
              Service  (Amazon  SNS)  topic.  Run Command pushes notifications
              about command status changes to this topic.

          NotificationEvents -> (list)
              The different events for which you can receive notifications. To
              learn  more  about  these events, see Monitoring Systems Manager
              status changes using Amazon SNS notifications in the Amazon  Web
              Services Systems Manager User Guide .

              (string)

          NotificationType -> (string)
              The type of notification.

              o Command  :  Receive  notification when the status of a command
                changes.

              o Invocation : For commands  sent  to  multiple  managed  nodes,
                receive  notification on a per-node basis when the status of a
                command changes.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          NotificationArn=string,NotificationEvents=string,string,NotificationType=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "NotificationArn": "string",
            "NotificationEvents": ["All"|"InProgress"|"Success"|"TimedOut"|"Cancelled"|"Failed", ...],
            "NotificationType": "Command"|"Invocation"
          }

       --cloud-watch-output-config (structure)
          Enables Amazon Web Services Systems Manager to send Run Command out-
          put to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Run Command is a capability of Amazon
          Web Services Systems Manager.

          CloudWatchLogGroupName -> (string)
              The name of the CloudWatch Logs log group where you want to send
              command  output.  If  you don't specify a group name, Amazon Web
              Services Systems Manager automatically creates a log  group  for
              you. The log group uses the following naming format:

                 ``
                 aws/ssm/SystemsManagerDocumentName ``

          CloudWatchOutputEnabled -> (boolean)
              Enables  Systems  Manager  to  send command output to CloudWatch
              Logs.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CloudWatchLogGroupName=string,CloudWatchOutputEnabled=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CloudWatchLogGroupName": "string",
            "CloudWatchOutputEnabled": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                   ues=AWS::EC2::INSTANCE,AWS::EC2::VPC   This example  demon-
                   strates  how  to  target  only Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
                   (Amazon EC2) instances and VPCs in your maintenance window.

                 o Automation  targets  only  : Key=ResourceGroup,Values=MyRe-
                   sourceGroup

                 o State  Manager  association  targets  only  :   Key=Instan-
                   ceIds,Values=*    This  example  demonstrates how to target
                   all managed instances in the  Amazon  Web  Services  Region
                   where the association was created.

                 For  more  information about how to send commands that target
                 managed nodes using Key,Value parameters, see Targeting  mul-
                 tiple  instances  in  the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager
                 User Guide .

                 Key -> (string)
                     User-defined criteria for sending  commands  that  target
                     managed nodes that meet the criteria.

                 Values -> (list)
                     User-defined  criteria that maps to Key . For example, if
                     you  specified  tag:ServerRole  ,   you   could   specify
                     value:WebServer  to  run  a  command  on  instances  that
                     include EC2 tags of ServerRole,WebServer .

                     Depending on the type of target, the  maximum  number  of
                     values  for  a key might be lower than the global maximum
                     of 50.

                     (string)

          RequestedDateTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time the command was requested.

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the command.

          StatusDetails -> (string)
              A  detailed  status  of  the  command  execution.  StatusDetails
              includes more information than Status because it includes states
              resulting from error and concurrency control parameters. Status-
              Details  can show different results than Status. For more infor-
              mation about these statuses, see Understanding command  statuses
              in  the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide . Status-
              Details can be one of the following values:

              o Pending: The command hasn't been sent to any managed nodes.

              o In Progress: The command has been sent to at least one managed
                node but hasn't reached a final state on all managed nodes.

              o Success: The command successfully ran on all invocations. This
                is a terminal state.

              o Delivery Timed Out: The value of  MaxErrors  or  more  command
                invocations  shows  a  status of Delivery Timed Out. This is a
                terminal state.

              o Execution Timed Out: The value of MaxErrors  or  more  command
                invocations  shows  a status of Execution Timed Out. This is a
                terminal state.

              o Failed: The value of MaxErrors  or  more  command  invocations
                shows a status of Failed. This is a terminal state.

              o Incomplete: The command was attempted on all managed nodes and
                one or more invocations doesn't have a value  of  Success  but
                not  enough  invocations  failed  for the status to be Failed.
                This is a terminal state.

              o Cancelled: The command was terminated before it was completed.
                This is a terminal state.

              o Rate  Exceeded:  The  number  of managed nodes targeted by the
                command exceeded the account limit  for  pending  invocations.
                The  system  has canceled the command before running it on any
                managed node. This is a terminal state.

          OutputS3Region -> (string)
              (Deprecated) You can no longer specify this parameter. The  sys-

          MaxConcurrency -> (string)
              The  maximum number of managed nodes that are allowed to run the
              command at the same time. You can specify a  number  of  managed
              nodes,  such  as  10, or a percentage of nodes, such as 10%. The
              default value is 50. For more information about how to use  Max-
              Concurrency  ,  see  Running  commands using Systems Manager Run
              Command in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide  .

          MaxErrors -> (string)
              The  maximum  number  of  errors allowed before the system stops
              sending the command to additional targets.  You  can  specify  a
              number of errors, such as 10, or a percentage or errors, such as
              10%. The default value is 0 . For more information about how  to
              use  MaxErrors  , see Running commands using Systems Manager Run
