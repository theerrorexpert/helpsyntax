NAME
       describe-automation-executions -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides details about all active and terminated Automation executions.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-automation-executions is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: AutomationExecutionMetadataList

SYNOPSIS
            describe-automation-executions
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Filters used to limit the scope of executions that are requested.

          (structure)
              A  filter  used to match specific automation executions. This is
              used to limit the  scope  of  Automation  execution  information
              returned.

              Key -> (string)
                 One or more keys to limit the results.

              Values -> (list)
                 The values used to limit the execution information associated
                 with the filter's key.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "DocumentNamePrefix"|"ExecutionStatus"|"ExecutionId"|"ParentExecutionId"|"CurrentAction"|"StartTimeBefore"|"StartTimeAfter"|"AutomationType"|"TagKey"|"TargetResourceGroup"|"AutomationSubtype"|"OpsItemId",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                       in the resource group ProductionResourceGroup  in  your
                       maintenance window.

                       nance window.

                       get  all  managed  instances in the Amazon Web Services
                       Region where the association was created.

                     For more information about how to send commands that tar-
                     get   managed   nodes  using  Key,Value  parameters,  see
                     Targeting multiple instances in the Amazon  Web  Services

                     Values -> (list)
                        User-defined criteria that maps to Key . For  example,
                        if  you  specified  tag:ServerRole , you could specify
                        value:WebServer to run a  command  on  instances  that
                        include EC2 tags of ServerRole,WebServer .

                        Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of
                        values for a key might be lower than the global  maxi-
                        mum of 50.

                     during the Automation execution.

                 Truncated -> (boolean)
                     A  boolean  value  indicating whether the resolved target
                     list is truncated.

                 Use  this filter with  DescribeAutomationExecutions . Specify
                 either Local or CrossAccount. CrossAccount is  an  Automation

                 Web Services accounts. For more information, see Running  Au-

                               could specify value:WebServer to run a  command
                               on  instances  that include EC2 tags of Server-

                               Depending on the type of  target,  the  maximum
                               number  of values for a key might be lower than
                               the global maximum of 50.
