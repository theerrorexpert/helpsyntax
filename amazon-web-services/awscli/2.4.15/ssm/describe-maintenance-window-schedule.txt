DESCRIBE-MAINTENANCE-WINDOW-SCHEDULE()  DESCRIBE-MAINTENANCE-WINDOW-SCHEDULE()



NAME
       describe-maintenance-window-schedule -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information  about upcoming executions of a maintenance win-
       dow.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-maintenance-window-schedule is a paginated operation. Multiple
       API  calls  may  be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: ScheduledWindowExecutions

SYNOPSIS
            describe-maintenance-window-schedule
          [--window-id <value>]
          [--targets <value>]
          [--resource-type <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --window-id (string)
          The ID of the maintenance window to retrieve information about.

       --targets (list)
          The managed node ID or key-value pair to retrieve information about.

          (structure)
              An array of search criteria that targets managed nodes  using  a
              key-value pair that you specify.

              NOTE:
                 One  or more targets must be specified for maintenance window
                 Run Command-type tasks. Depending on the  task,  targets  are
                 optional for other maintenance window task types (Automation,
                 Lambda, and Step Functions). For more information about  run-
                 ning  tasks that don't specify targets, see Registering main-
                 tenance window tasks without targets in the Amazon  Web  Ser-
                 vices Systems Manager User Guide .

              Supported formats include the following.

              o Key=InstanceIds,Val-
                ues=<instance-id-1>,<instance-id-2>,<instance-id-3>

              o Key=tag:<my-tag-key>,Values=<my-tag-value-1>,<my-tag-value-2>

              o Key=tag-key,Values=<my-tag-key-1>,<my-tag-key-2>

              o Run  Command   and   Maintenance   window   targets   only   :
                Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=<resource-group-name>

              o Maintenance         window        targets        only        :
                Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Val-
                ues=<resource-type-1>,<resource-type-2>

              o Automation     targets     only    :    Key=ResourceGroup;Val-
                ues=<resource-group-name>

              For example:

              o Key=InstanceIds,Values=i-02573cafcfEXAMPLE,i-0471e04240EXAM-
                PLE,i-07782c72faEXAMPLE

              o Key=tag:CostCenter,Values=CostCenter1,CostCenter2,CostCenter3

              o Key=tag-key,Values=Name,Instance-Type,CostCenter

              o Run   Command   and   Maintenance   window   targets   only  :
                Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=ProductionResourceGroup   This
                example  demonstrates  how  to  target  all  resources  in the
                resource group  ProductionResourceGroup  in  your  maintenance
                window.

              o Maintenance         window        targets        only        :
                Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Val-
                ues=AWS::EC2::INSTANCE,AWS::EC2::VPC     This  example  demon-
                strates how to target only Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud  (Ama-
                zon EC2) instances and VPCs in your maintenance window.

              o Automation targets only : Key=ResourceGroup,Values=MyResource-
                Group

              o State Manager association targets only :  Key=InstanceIds,Val-
                ues=*    This  example  demonstrates how to target all managed
                instances in the Amazon Web Services Region where the associa-
                tion was created.

              For more information about how to send commands that target man-
              aged nodes using Key,Value parameters,  see  Targeting  multiple
              instances  in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide
              .

              Key -> (string)
                 User-defined criteria for sending commands that  target  man-
                 aged nodes that meet the criteria.

              Values -> (list)
                 User-defined  criteria that maps to Key . For example, if you
                 specified tag:ServerRole , you could specify  value:WebServer
                 to  run  a  command  on  instances  that  include EC2 tags of
                 ServerRole,WebServer .

                 Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of values
                 for a key might be lower than the global maximum of 50.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --resource-type (string)
          The  type  of  resource  you want to retrieve information about. For
          example, INSTANCE .

          Possible values:

          o INSTANCE

          o RESOURCE_GROUP

       --filters (list)
          Filters used to limit the range of results.  For  example,  you  can
          limit  maintenance  window executions to only those scheduled before
          or after a certain date and time.

          (structure)
              Defines a filter used in Patch Manager  APIs.  Supported  filter
              keys depend on the API operation that includes the filter. Patch
              Manager API operations that use PatchOrchestratorFilter  include
              the following:

              o DescribeAvailablePatches

              o DescribeInstancePatches

              o DescribePatchBaselines

              o DescribePatchGroups

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for the filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 The value for the filter.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
