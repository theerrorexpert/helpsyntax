NAME
       describe-patch-group-state -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  high-level aggregated patch compliance state information for a
       patch group.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-patch-group-state
          --patch-group <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --patch-group (string)
          The  name  of  the  patch  group  whose  patch  snapshot  should  be
          retrieved.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the state of a patch group

       The   following   describe-patch-group-state   example   retrieves  the
       high-level patch compliance summary for a patch group.

          aws ssm describe-patch-group-state \
              --patch-group "Production"

       Output:

          {
              "Instances": 21,
              "InstancesWithCriticalNonCompliantPatches": 1,
              "InstancesWithFailedPatches": 2,
              "InstancesWithInstalledOtherPatches": 3,
              "InstancesWithInstalledPatches": 21,
              "InstancesWithInstalledPendingRebootPatches": 2,
              "InstancesWithInstalledRejectedPatches": 1,
              "InstancesWithMissingPatches": 3,
              "InstancesWithNotApplicablePatches": 4,
              "InstancesWithOtherNonCompliantPatches": 1,

              "InstancesWithUnreportedNotApplicablePatches": 2
          }

OUTPUT
       Instances -> (integer)
          The number of managed nodes in the patch group.

       InstancesWithInstalledPatches -> (integer)
          The number of managed nodes with installed patches.

       InstancesWithInstalledOtherPatches -> (integer)
          The  number  of  managed  nodes  with  patches installed that aren't
          defined in the patch baseline.

       InstancesWithInstalledPendingRebootPatches -> (integer)
          The number of managed nodes with patches installed by Patch  Manager
          that  haven't been rebooted after the patch installation. The status
          of these managed nodes is NON_COMPLIANT .

       InstancesWithInstalledRejectedPatches -> (integer)
          The number of managed nodes with patches installed that  are  speci-
          fied   in   a   RejectedPatches  list.  Patches  with  a  status  of
          INSTALLED_REJECTED were typically installed before they  were  added
          to a RejectedPatches list.

          NOTE:
              If  ALLOW_AS_DEPENDENCY  is  the  specified option for Rejected-
              PatchesAction ,  the  value  of  InstancesWithInstalledRejected-
              Patches will always be 0 (zero).

       InstancesWithMissingPatches -> (integer)
          The  number  of  managed  nodes  with missing patches from the patch
          baseline.

       InstancesWithFailedPatches -> (integer)
          The number of managed nodes with patches  from  the  patch  baseline
          that failed to install.

       InstancesWithNotApplicablePatches -> (integer)
          The number of managed nodes with patches that aren't applicable.

       InstancesWithUnreportedNotApplicablePatches -> (integer)
          The  number  of  managed nodes with NotApplicable patches beyond the
          supported limit, which aren't reported by name to Inventory.  Inven-
          tory is a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager.

       InstancesWithCriticalNonCompliantPatches -> (integer)
          The  number  of  managed  nodes  where patches that are specified as
          Critical for compliance  reporting  in  the  patch  baseline  aren't
          installed. These patches might be missing, have failed installation,
          were rejected, or were installed but  awaiting  a  required  managed
          node reboot. The status of these managed nodes is NON_COMPLIANT .

       InstancesWithSecurityNonCompliantPatches -> (integer)
          The  number  of  managed  nodes  where patches that are specified as
          Security in a patch advisory aren't installed. These  patches  might
          be  missing,  have  failed  installation,  were  rejected,  or  were
          installed but awaiting a required managed node reboot. The status of
          these managed nodes is NON_COMPLIANT .

       InstancesWithOtherNonCompliantPatches -> (integer)
          The  number  of managed nodes with patches installed that are speci-
          fied as other than Critical or Security but  aren't  compliant  with
          the patch baseline. The status of these managed nodes is NON_COMPLI-
          ANT .
