LIST-ASSOCIATIONS()                                        LIST-ASSOCIATIONS()



NAME
       list-associations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  all  State Manager associations in the current Amazon Web Ser-
       vices account and Amazon Web Services Region. You can limit the results
       to  a  specific  State  Manager association document or managed node by
       specifying a filter. State Manager is a capability of Amazon  Web  Ser-
       vices Systems Manager.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-associations  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Associations

SYNOPSIS
            list-associations
          [--association-filter-list <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --association-filter-list (list)
          One or more filters. Use a filter to return a more specific list  of
          results.

          NOTE:
              Filtering  associations  using  the  InstanceID  attribute  only
              returns  legacy  associations  created  using   the   InstanceID
              attribute. Associations targeting the managed node that are part
              of the Target Attributes ResourceGroup or Tags aren't  returned.

          (structure)
              Describes a filter.

              key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

                 NOTE:
                     InstanceId has been deprecated.

              value -> (string)
                 The filter value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "InstanceId"|"Name"|"AssociationId"|"AssociationStatusName"|"LastExecutedBefore"|"LastExecutedAfter"|"AssociationName"|"ResourceGroupName",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Associations -> (list)
          The associations.

          (structure)
              Describes an association of a Amazon Web Services  Systems  Man-
              ager document (SSM document) and a managed node.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the SSM document.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The managed node ID.

              AssociationId -> (string)
                 The  ID created by the system when you create an association.
                 An association is a binding between a document and a  set  of
                 targets with a schedule.

              AssociationVersion -> (string)
                 The association version.

              DocumentVersion -> (string)
                 The version of the document used in the association.

                 WARNING:
                     State  Manager  doesn't support running associations that
                     use a new version of  a  document  if  that  document  is
                     shared  from  another  account. State Manager always runs
                     the default version of a document if shared from  another
                     account,  even  though  the Systems Manager console shows
                     that a new version was processed. If you want to  run  an
                     association using a new version of a document shared form
                     another account, you must set  the  document  version  to
                     default .

              Targets -> (list)
                 The  managed nodes targeted by the request to create an asso-
                 ciation. You can target all managed nodes in  an  Amazon  Web
                 Services  account  by  specifying  the InstanceIds key with a
                 value of * .

                 (structure)
                     An array of search criteria that  targets  managed  nodes
                     using a key-value pair that you specify.

                     NOTE:
                        One  or more targets must be specified for maintenance
                        window Run Command-type tasks. Depending on the  task,
                        targets are optional for other maintenance window task
                        types (Automation, Lambda, and  Step  Functions).  For
                        more  information about running tasks that don't spec-
                        ify targets, see Registering maintenance window  tasks
                        without  targets  in  the  Amazon Web Services Systems
                        Manager User Guide .

                     Supported formats include the following.

                     o Key=InstanceIds,Val-
                       ues=<instance-id-1>,<instance-id-2>,<instance-id-3>

                     o Key=tag-key,Values=<my-tag-key-1>,<my-tag-key-2>

                     o Run Command  and  Maintenance  window  targets  only  :
                       Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=<resource-group-name>

                     o Maintenance       window       targets      only      :

                       ues=<resource-group-name>

                     For example:

                     o Key=InstanceIds,Values=i-02573cafcfEXAM-
                       PLE,i-0471e04240EXAMPLE,i-07782c72faEXAMPLE

                       Center3

                     o Key=tag-key,Values=Name,Instance-Type,CostCenter

                     o Run Command  and  Maintenance  window  targets  only  :
                       Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=ProductionResourceGroup
                       This example demonstrates how to target  all  resources
                       in  the  resource group ProductionResourceGroup in your
                       maintenance window.

                     o Maintenance      window      targets       only       :
                       Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Val-
                       ues=AWS::EC2::INSTANCE,AWS::EC2::VPC     This   example
                       demonstrates  how to target only Amazon Elastic Compute
                       Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and VPCs in  your  mainte-
                       nance window.

                     o Automation   targets   only   :  Key=ResourceGroup,Val-
                       ues=MyResourceGroup

                     o State Manager association targets  only  :  Key=Instan-
                       ceIds,Values=*    This example demonstrates how to tar-
                       get all managed instances in the  Amazon  Web  Services
                       Region where the association was created.

                     For more information about how to send commands that tar-
                     get  managed  nodes  using  Key,Value   parameters,   see
                     Targeting  multiple  instances in the Amazon Web Services
                     Systems Manager User Guide .

                     Key -> (string)
                        User-defined criteria for sending commands that target
                        managed nodes that meet the criteria.

                     Values -> (list)
                        User-defined  criteria that maps to Key . For example,
                        if you specified tag:ServerRole ,  you  could  specify
                        value:WebServer  to  run  a  command on instances that
                        include EC2 tags of ServerRole,WebServer .

                        Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of
                        values  for a key might be lower than the global maxi-
                        mum of 50.

                        (string)

              LastExecutionDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date on which the association was last run.

              Overview -> (structure)
                 Information about the association.

                 Status -> (string)
                     The status of the association. Status  can  be:  Pending,
                     Success, or Failed.

                 DetailedStatus -> (string)
                     A detailed status of the association.

                 AssociationStatusAggregatedCount -> (map)
                     Returns the number of targets for the association status.
                     For example, if you created an association with two  man-
                     aged  nodes,  and  one of them was successful, this would
                     return the count of managed nodes by status.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (integer)
