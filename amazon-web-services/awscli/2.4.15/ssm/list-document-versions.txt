LIST-DOCUMENT-VERSIONS()                              LIST-DOCUMENT-VERSIONS()



NAME
       list-document-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       List all versions for a document.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-document-versions is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: DocumentVersions

SYNOPSIS
            list-document-versions
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the document. You can specify an  Amazon  Resource  Name
          (ARN).

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list document versions

       The following list-document-versions example lists all versions  for  a
       Systems Manager document.

          aws ssm list-document-versions \
              --name "Example"

       Output:

          {
              "DocumentVersions": [
                  {
                      "Name": "Example",
                      "DocumentVersion": "1",
                      "CreatedDate": 1583257938.266,
                      "IsDefaultVersion": true,
                      "DocumentFormat": "YAML",
                      "Status": "Active"
                  }
              ]
          }

       sion Parameter in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.

              Name -> (string)
                 The document name.

              DisplayName -> (string)
                 The friendly name of the SSM document. This value can  differ

              DocumentVersion -> (string)
                 The document version.

              VersionName -> (string)
                 The version of the artifact associated with the document. For
                 example,  "Release 12, Update 6". This value is unique across
                 all versions of a document, and can't be changed.

              CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date the document was created.

              IsDefaultVersion -> (boolean)
                 An identifier for the default version of the document.

                 might  be  explained  by  the StatusInformation message, "The
                 specified S3 bucket doesn't exist. Verify that the URL of the
                 S3 bucket is correct."
