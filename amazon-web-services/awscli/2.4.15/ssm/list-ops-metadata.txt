LIST-OPS-METADATA()                                        LIST-OPS-METADATA()



NAME
       list-ops-metadata -

DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Web Services Systems Manager calls this API operation when dis-
       playing all Application Manager OpsMetadata objects or blobs.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-ops-metadata is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: OpsMetadataList

SYNOPSIS
            list-ops-metadata
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          One  or  more  filters  to  limit  the number of OpsMetadata objects
          returned by the call.

          (structure)
              A filter to limit the number of OpsMetadata objects displayed.

              Key -> (string)
                 A filter key.

              Values -> (list)
                 A filter value.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       OpsMetadataList -> (list)
          Returns a list of OpsMetadata objects.

          (structure)
              Operational  metadata for an application in Application Manager.

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Application Manager application.

              OpsMetadataArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the OpsMetadata  Object  or
                 blob.

              LastModifiedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date the OpsMetadata object was last updated.

              LastModifiedUser -> (string)
                 The user name who last updated the OpsMetadata object.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date the OpsMetadata objects was created.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of items to return. Use this token to get
          the next set of results.
