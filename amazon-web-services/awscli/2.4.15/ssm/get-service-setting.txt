GET-SERVICE-SETTING()                                    GET-SERVICE-SETTING()



NAME
       get-service-setting -

DESCRIPTION
          ServiceSetting  is  an  account-level setting for an Amazon Web Ser-
          vices service. This setting defines how a  user  interacts  with  or
          uses  a service or a feature of a service. For example, if an Amazon
          Web Services service charges money to the account based  on  feature
          or  service  usage,  then the Amazon Web Services service team might
          create a default setting of false . This means the  user  can't  use
          this  feature  unless they change the setting to true and intention-
          ally opt in for a paid feature.

       Services map a SettingId object to a setting value. Amazon Web Services
       services  teams  define  the  default value for a SettingId . You can't
       create a new SettingId , but you can overwrite the default value if you
       have  the  ssm:UpdateServiceSetting permission for the setting. Use the
       UpdateServiceSetting API operation to change the  default  setting.  Or
       use  the   ResetServiceSetting to change the value back to the original
       value defined by the Amazon Web Services service team.

       Query the current service setting for the Amazon Web Services  account.

SYNOPSIS
            get-service-setting
          --setting-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --setting-id (string)
          The  ID  of the service setting to get. The setting ID can be one of
          the following.

          o /ssm/automation/customer-script-log-destination

          o /ssm/automation/customer-script-log-group-name

          o /ssm/documents/console/public-sharing-permission

          o /ssm/parameter-store/default-parameter-tier

          o /ssm/parameter-store/high-throughput-enabled

          o /ssm/managed-instance/activation-tier

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
