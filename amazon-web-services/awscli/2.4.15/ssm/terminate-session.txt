NAME
       terminate-session -

DESCRIPTION
       Permanently  ends  a session and closes the data connection between the
       Session Manager client and SSM Agent on the managed node. A  terminated
       session isn't be resumed.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            terminate-session
          --session-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --session-id (string)
          The ID of the session to terminate.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To end a Session Manager session

       This terminate-session example permanently ends a session that was cre-

       between the Session Manager client and SSM Agent on the instance.

          aws ssm terminate-session \
              --session-id "Shirley-Rodriguez-07a16060613c408b5"

          {
              "SessionId": "Shirley-Rodriguez-07a16060613c408b5"
          }
