SYNOPSIS
            update-document
          --content <value>
          [--attachments <value>]
          --name <value>
          [--display-name <value>]
          [--version-name <value>]
          [--document-version <value>]
          [--document-format <value>]
          [--target-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --content (string)
          A valid JSON or YAML string.

       --attachments (list)
          A  list of key-value pairs that describe attachments to a version of
          a document.

          (structure)
              Identifying information about a document  attachment,  including
              the  file name and a key-value pair that identifies the location
              of an attachment to a document.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of a key-value pair that identifies the  location  of
                 an attachment to a document.

              Values -> (list)
                 The value of a key-value pair that identifies the location of
                 an attachment to a document. The format for Value depends  on
                 the type of key you specify.

                 o For the key SourceUrl , the value is an S3 bucket location.
                   For     example:      "Values":      [      "s3://doc-exam-
                   ple-bucket/my-folder" ]

                 o For  the  key  S3FileUrl  ,  the  value  is a file in an S3
                   bucket.   For   example:    "Values":   [   "s3://doc-exam-
                   ple-bucket/my-folder/my-file.py" ]

                 o For  the key AttachmentReference , the value is constructed
                   from the name of another SSM document in  your  account,  a
                   version  number  of  that  document, and a file attached to
                   that document version that you want to reuse. For  example:
                   "Values":  [  "MyOtherDocument/3/my-other-file.py" ]   How-
                   ever, if the SSM document is shared with you  from  another
                   account,  the  full  SSM  document  ARN  must  be specified
                   instead of the document name only. For example:   "Values":
                   [     "arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:111122223333:document/OtherAc-
                   countDocument/3/their-file.py" ]

                 (string)

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the document attachment file.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string,Name=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "SourceUrl"|"S3FileUrl"|"AttachmentReference",
              "Values": ["string", ...],
              "Name": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --name (string)
          The name of the SSM document that you want to update.

       --display-name (string)
          The friendly name of the SSM document that you want to update.  This
          value  can  differ  for  each  version of the document. If you don't
          specify a value for this parameter in  your  request,  the  existing
          value is applied to the new document version.

       --version-name (string)
          An  optional  field  specifying  the version of the artifact you are
          updating with the document. For example,  "Release  12,  Update  6".
          This value is unique across all versions of a document, and can't be
          changed.

       --document-version (string)
          The version of the document that you want to update. Currently, Sys-
          tems  Manager supports updating only the latest version of the docu-
          ment. You can specify the version number of the  latest  version  or
          use the $LATEST variable.

       --document-format (string)
          Specify  the  document  format for the new document version. Systems
          Manager supports JSON and YAML documents. JSON is the  default  for-
          mat.

          Possible values:

          o YAML

          o JSON

          o TEXT

       --target-type (string)
          Specify a new target type for the document.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a new version of a document

       The  following update-document example creates a new version of a docu-
       ment when run on a Windows computer. The document specified by  --docu-
       ment  must be in JSON format. Note that file:// must be referenced fol-
       lowed by the path of the content file. Because of the $ at  the  begin-
       ning  of the --document-version parameter, On Windows you must surround
       the value with double quotes. On  Linux,  MacOS,  or  at  a  PowerShell
       prompt, you must surround the value with single quotes.

       Windows version:

          aws ssm update-document \
              --name "RunShellScript" \
              --content "file://RunShellScript.json" \
              --document-version "$LATEST"

       Linux/Mac version:

          aws ssm update-document \
              --name "RunShellScript" \
              --content "file://RunShellScript.json" \
              --document-version '$LATEST'

       Output:
