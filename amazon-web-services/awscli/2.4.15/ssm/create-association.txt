CREATE-ASSOCIATION()                                      CREATE-ASSOCIATION()



NAME
       create-association -

DESCRIPTION
       A State Manager association defines the state that you want to maintain
       on your managed nodes. For example, an  association  can  specify  that
       anti-virus  software  must  be  installed  and  running on your managed
       nodes, or that certain ports must be closed. For  static  targets,  the
       association  specifies  a  schedule for when the configuration is reap-
       plied. For dynamic targets, such as an  Amazon  Web  Services  resource
       group  or  an  Amazon  Web Services autoscaling group, State Manager, a
       capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager applies the  configu-
       ration  when  new managed nodes are added to the group. The association
       also specifies actions to take when  applying  the  configuration.  For
       example,  an  association for anti-virus software might run once a day.
       If the software isn't installed, then State Manager installs it. If the
       software is installed, but the service isn't running, then the associa-
       tion might instruct State Manager to start the service.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the SSM Command document or Automation runbook that con-
          tains the configuration information for the managed node.

          You  can specify Amazon Web Services-predefined documents, documents
          you created, or a document that is  shared  with  you  from  another
          account.

          For  Systems  Manager documents (SSM documents) that are shared with
          you from other Amazon Web Services accounts, you  must  specify  the
          complete SSM document ARN, in the following format:

              ``
              arn:partition :ssm:region :account-id :document/document-name ``

          For example:
              arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:12345678912:document/My-Shared-Document

          For Amazon Web Services-predefined documents and SSM  documents  you
          created in your account, you only need to specify the document name.
          For example, AWS-ApplyPatchBaseline or My-Document .

       --document-version (string)
          The document version you want to associate with the  target(s).  Can
          be a specific version or the default version.

          WARNING:
              State  Manager  doesn't  support running associations that use a
              new version of a  document  if  that  document  is  shared  from
              another  account.  State Manager always runs the default version
              of a document if shared from another account,  even  though  the
              Systems  Manager console shows that a new version was processed.
              If you want to run an association using a new version of a docu-
              ment shared form another account, you must set the document ver-
              sion to default .

       --instance-id (string)
          The managed node ID.

          NOTE:
              InstanceId has been deprecated. To specify a managed node ID for
              an association, use the Targets parameter. Requests that include
              the parameter InstanceID with  Systems  Manager  documents  (SSM
              documents)  that  use  schema version 2.0 or later will fail. In
              addition, if you use the parameter InstanceId ,  you  can't  use
              the  parameters  AssociationName , DocumentVersion , MaxErrors ,
              MaxConcurrency , OutputLocation , or ScheduleExpression . To use
              these parameters, you must use the Targets parameter.

       --parameters (map)
          The parameters for the runtime configuration of the document.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,string,KeyName2=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": ["string", ...]
            ...}

       --targets (list)
          The  targets  for  the  association. You can target managed nodes by
          using tags, Amazon Web Services resource groups, all  managed  nodes
          in  an  Amazon Web Services account, or individual managed node IDs.
          You can target all managed nodes in an Amazon Web  Services  account
          by  specifying  the  InstanceIds  key  with  a value of * . For more
          information about choosing targets for  an  association,  see  Using
          targets  and  rate  controls  with State Manager associations in the
          Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide .

          (structure)
              An array of search criteria that targets managed nodes  using  a
              key-value pair that you specify.

              NOTE:
                 One  or more targets must be specified for maintenance window
                 Run Command-type tasks. Depending on the  task,  targets  are
                 optional for other maintenance window task types (Automation,
                 Lambda, and Step Functions). For more information about  run-
                 ning  tasks that don't specify targets, see Registering main-
                 tenance window tasks without targets in the Amazon  Web  Ser-
                 vices Systems Manager User Guide .

              Supported formats include the following.

              o Key=InstanceIds,Val-
                ues=<instance-id-1>,<instance-id-2>,<instance-id-3>

              o Key=tag:<my-tag-key>,Values=<my-tag-value-1>,<my-tag-value-2>

              o Key=tag-key,Values=<my-tag-key-1>,<my-tag-key-2>

              o Run  Command   and   Maintenance   window   targets   only   :
                Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=<resource-group-name>

              o Maintenance         window        targets        only        :
                Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Val-
                ues=<resource-type-1>,<resource-type-2>

              o Automation     targets     only    :    Key=ResourceGroup;Val-
                ues=<resource-group-name>

              For example:

              o Key=InstanceIds,Values=i-02573cafcfEXAMPLE,i-0471e04240EXAM-
                PLE,i-07782c72faEXAMPLE

              o Key=tag:CostCenter,Values=CostCenter1,CostCenter2,CostCenter3

              o Key=tag-key,Values=Name,Instance-Type,CostCenter

              o Run   Command   and   Maintenance   window   targets   only  :
                Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=ProductionResourceGroup   This
                example  demonstrates  how  to  target  all  resources  in the
                resource group  ProductionResourceGroup  in  your  maintenance
                window.

              o Maintenance         window        targets        only        :
                Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Val-
                ues=AWS::EC2::INSTANCE,AWS::EC2::VPC     This  example  demon-
                strates how to target only Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud  (Ama-
                zon EC2) instances and VPCs in your maintenance window.

              o Automation targets only : Key=ResourceGroup,Values=MyResource-
                Group

              o State Manager association targets only :  Key=InstanceIds,Val-
                ues=*    This  example  demonstrates how to target all managed
                instances in the Amazon Web Services Region where the associa-
                tion was created.

              For more information about how to send commands that target man-
              aged nodes using Key,Value parameters,  see  Targeting  multiple
              instances  in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide
              .

              Key -> (string)
                 User-defined criteria for sending commands that  target  man-
                 aged nodes that meet the criteria.

              Values -> (list)
                 User-defined  criteria that maps to Key . For example, if you
                 specified tag:ServerRole , you could specify  value:WebServer
                 to  run  a  command  on  instances  that  include EC2 tags of
                 ServerRole,WebServer .

                 Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of values
                 for a key might be lower than the global maximum of 50.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --schedule-expression (string)
          A  cron  expression when the association will be applied to the tar-
          get(s).

       --output-location (structure)
          An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket where  you  want
          to store the output details of the request.

          S3Location -> (structure)
              An  S3  bucket  where  you  want  to  store  the results of this
              request.

              OutputS3Region -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services Region of the S3 bucket.

              OutputS3BucketName -> (string)
                 The name of the S3 bucket.

              OutputS3KeyPrefix -> (string)
                 The S3 bucket subfolder.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Location={OutputS3Region=string,OutputS3BucketName=string,OutputS3KeyPrefix=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Location": {
              "OutputS3Region": "string",
              "OutputS3BucketName": "string",
              "OutputS3KeyPrefix": "string"
            }
          }

       --association-name (string)
          Specify a descriptive name for the association.

       --automation-target-parameter-name (string)
          Choose the parameter that  will  define  how  your  automation  will
          branch out. This target is required for associations that use an Au-
          tomation runbook and target resources by using rate controls.  Auto-
          mation is a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager.

       --max-errors (string)
          The  number of errors that are allowed before the system stops send-
          ing requests to run the association on additional targets.  You  can
          specify  either  an  absolute number of errors, for example 10, or a
          percentage of the target set, for example 10%. If you specify 3, for
          example,  the system stops sending requests when the fourth error is
          received. If you specify 0, then the system stops  sending  requests
          after  the  first error is returned. If you run an association on 50
          managed nodes and set MaxError to 10%, then the system stops sending
          the request when the sixth error is received.

          Executions that are already running an association when MaxErrors is
          reached are allowed to complete, but some of  these  executions  may
          fail  as  well.  If you need to ensure that there won't be more than
          max-errors failed executions, set MaxConcurrency to 1 so that execu-
          tions proceed one at a time.

       --max-concurrency (string)
          The  maximum number of targets allowed to run the association at the
          same time. You can specify a number, for example 10, or a percentage
          of the target set, for example 10%. The default value is 100%, which
          means all targets run the association at the same time.

          If a new managed node starts and  attempts  to  run  an  association
          while  Systems  Manager  is running MaxConcurrency associations, the
          association is allowed to run. During the next association interval,
          the  new  managed node will process its association within the limit
          specified for MaxConcurrency .

       --compliance-severity (string)
          The severity level to assign to the association.

          Possible values:

          o CRITICAL

          o HIGH

          o MEDIUM

          o LOW

          o UNSPECIFIED

       --sync-compliance (string)
          The mode for generating association compliance. You can specify AUTO
          or MANUAL . In AUTO mode, the system uses the status of the associa-
          tion execution to determine the compliance status. If  the  associa-
          tion  execution runs successfully, then the association is COMPLIANT
          . If the association execution doesn't run successfully, the associ-
          ation is NON-COMPLIANT .

          In  MANUAL  mode,  you must specify the AssociationId as a parameter
          for the  PutComplianceItems API operation. In this case,  compliance
          data  isn't  managed  by State Manager. It is managed by your direct
          call to the  PutComplianceItems API operation.

          By default, all associations use AUTO mode.

          Possible values:

          o AUTO

          o MANUAL

       --apply-only-at-cron-interval    |     --no-apply-only-at-cron-interval
       (boolean)
          By  default,  when  you create a new association, the system runs it
          immediately after it is created and then according to  the  schedule
          you  specified. Specify this option if you don't want an association
          to run immediately after you create it. This  parameter  isn't  sup-
          ported for rate expressions.

       --calendar-names (list)
          The  names  or  Amazon  Resource Names (ARNs) of the Change Calendar
          type documents you want to gate your associations under. The associ-
          ations only run when that change calendar is open. For more informa-
          tion, see Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Change Calendar .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --target-locations (list)
          A location is a combination of Amazon Web Services Regions and  Ama-
          zon Web Services accounts where you want to run the association. Use
          this action to create an association in multiple Regions and  multi-
          ple accounts.

          (structure)
              The  combination  of  Amazon Web Services Regions and Amazon Web
              Services accounts targeted by the current Automation  execution.

              Accounts -> (list)
                 The  Amazon Web Services accounts targeted by the current Au-
                 tomation execution.

                 (string)

              Regions -> (list)
                 The Amazon Web Services Regions targeted by the current Auto-
                 mation execution.

                 (string)

              TargetLocationMaxConcurrency -> (string)
                 The  maximum number of Amazon Web Services Regions and Amazon
                 Web Services accounts allowed to run the  Automation  concur-
                 rently.

              TargetLocationMaxErrors -> (string)
                 The  maximum number of errors allowed before the system stops
                 queueing additional Automation executions for  the  currently
                 running Automation.

              ExecutionRoleName -> (string)
                 The  Automation  execution role used by the currently running
                 Automation. If not specified, the default value  is  AWS-Sys-
                 temsManager-AutomationExecutionRole .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Accounts=string,string,Regions=string,string,TargetLocationMaxConcurrency=string,TargetLocationMaxErrors=string,ExecutionRoleName=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Accounts": ["string", ...],
              "Regions": ["string", ...],
              "TargetLocationMaxConcurrency": "string",
              "TargetLocationMaxErrors": "string",
              "ExecutionRoleName": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       Example 3: To create an association that runs only once

       This example creates a new association that only runs once on the spec-
       ified date and time. Associations created with a date in  the  past  or
       present (by the time it is processed the date is in the past) run imme-
       diately.

                     One  or  more  targets  must be specified for maintenance
                     window Run Command-type tasks.  Depending  on  the  task,
                     targets  are  optional  for other maintenance window task
                     types (Automation, Lambda, and Step Functions). For  more
                     information  about  running tasks that don't specify tar-
                     gets, see Registering maintenance  window  tasks  without
                     targets  in  the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User
                     Guide .

                 Supported formats include the following.

                   ues=<resource-type-1>,<resource-type-2>

                 o Automation    targets    only    :   Key=ResourceGroup;Val-
                   ues=<resource-group-name>

                 For example:

                 o Key=InstanceIds,Values=i-02573cafcfEXAM-
                   PLE,i-0471e04240EXAMPLE,i-07782c72faEXAMPLE

                 o Key=tag:CostCenter,Values=CostCenter1,CostCenter2,CostCen-
                   ter3

                 o Key=tag-key,Values=Name,Instance-Type,CostCenter

                 o Run  Command  and  Maintenance  window   targets   only   :
                   Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=ProductionResourceGroup
                   This example demonstrates how to target  all  resources  in
                   the  resource group ProductionResourceGroup in your mainte-
                   nance window.

                 o Maintenance       window       targets        only        :
                   Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Val-
                   ues=AWS::EC2::INSTANCE,AWS::EC2::VPC   This example  demon-
                   strates  how  to  target  only Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
                   (Amazon EC2) instances and VPCs in your maintenance window.

                 o Automation  targets  only  : Key=ResourceGroup,Values=MyRe-
                   sourceGroup

                 o State  Manager  association  targets  only  :   Key=Instan-
                   ceIds,Values=*    This  example  demonstrates how to target
                   all managed instances in the  Amazon  Web  Services  Region
                   where the association was created.

                 For  more  information about how to send commands that target
                 managed nodes using Key,Value parameters, see Targeting  mul-
                 tiple  instances  in  the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager
                 User Guide .

                 Key -> (string)
                     User-defined criteria for sending  commands  that  target
                     managed nodes that meet the criteria.

                 Values -> (list)
                     User-defined  criteria that maps to Key . For example, if
                     you  specified  tag:ServerRole  ,   you   could   specify
                     value:WebServer  to  run  a  command  on  instances  that
                     include EC2 tags of ServerRole,WebServer .

                     Depending on the type of target, the  maximum  number  of
                     values  for  a key might be lower than the global maximum
                     of 50.

                     (string)

          ScheduleExpression -> (string)
              A cron expression that specifies a schedule when the association
              runs.

          OutputLocation -> (structure)
              An  S3  bucket where you want to store the output details of the
              request.

              S3Location -> (structure)
                 An S3 bucket where you want to  store  the  results  of  this
                 request.

                 OutputS3Region -> (string)
                     The Amazon Web Services Region of the S3 bucket.

                 OutputS3BucketName -> (string)
                     The name of the S3 bucket.

                 OutputS3KeyPrefix -> (string)
                     The S3 bucket subfolder.

          LastExecutionDate -> (timestamp)
              The date on which the association was last run.

          LastSuccessfulExecutionDate -> (timestamp)
              The last date on which the association was successfully run.

          AssociationName -> (string)
              The association name.

          MaxErrors -> (string)
              The  number  of  errors that are allowed before the system stops
              sending requests to run the association on  additional  targets.
              You can specify either an absolute number of errors, for example
              10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%.  If  you
              specify  3,  for example, the system stops sending requests when
              the fourth error is received. If you specify 0, then the  system
              stops sending requests after the first error is returned. If you
              run an association on 50 managed nodes and set MaxError to  10%,
              then  the  system stops sending the request when the sixth error
              is received.

              Executions that are already running an association  when  MaxEr-
              rors  is reached are allowed to complete, but some of these exe-
              cutions may fail as well. If you need to ensure that there won't
              be more than max-errors failed executions, set MaxConcurrency to
              1 so that executions proceed one at a time.

          MaxConcurrency -> (string)
              The maximum number of targets allowed to run the association  at
              the  same  time.  You can specify a number, for example 10, or a
              percentage of the target set, for example 10%. The default value
              is 100%, which means all targets run the association at the same
              time.

              If a new managed node starts and attempts to run an  association
              while  Systems  Manager  is running MaxConcurrency associations,
              the association is allowed to run. During the  next  association
              interval,  the  new  managed  node  will process its association
              within the limit specified for MaxConcurrency .

          ComplianceSeverity -> (string)
              The severity level that is assigned to the association.

          SyncCompliance -> (string)
              The mode for generating association compliance. You can  specify
              AUTO or MANUAL . In AUTO mode, the system uses the status of the
              association execution to determine the compliance status. If the
              association execution runs successfully, then the association is
              COMPLIANT . If the association execution  doesn't  run  success-
              fully, the association is NON-COMPLIANT .

              In  MANUAL mode, you must specify the AssociationId as a parame-
              ter for the  PutComplianceItems API  operation.  In  this  case,
              compliance  data isn't managed by State Manager, a capability of
              Amazon Web Services Systems  Manager.  It  is  managed  by  your
              direct call to the  PutComplianceItems API operation.

              By default, all associations use AUTO mode.

          ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval -> (boolean)
              By  default, when you create a new associations, the system runs
              it immediately after it is created and  then  according  to  the
              schedule you specified. Specify this option if you don't want an
              association to run immediately after you create it. This parame-
              ter isn't supported for rate expressions.

          CalendarNames -> (list)
              The names or Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the Change Calendar
              type documents your associations are gated under.  The  associa-
              tions  only  run  when  that  change  calendar is open. For more
              information, see Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Change Cal-
              endar .

              (string)

          TargetLocations -> (list)
              The  combination  of  Amazon Web Services Regions and Amazon Web
              Services accounts where you want to run the association.

              (structure)
                 The combination of Amazon Web Services Regions and Amazon Web
                 Services  accounts  targeted by the current Automation execu-
                 tion.

                 Accounts -> (list)
                     The Amazon Web Services accounts targeted by the  current
                     Automation execution.

                     (string)

                 Regions -> (list)
                     The  Amazon  Web Services Regions targeted by the current
                     Automation execution.

                     (string)

                 TargetLocationMaxConcurrency -> (string)
                     The maximum number of Amazon  Web  Services  Regions  and
                     Amazon  Web  Services accounts allowed to run the Automa-
                     tion concurrently.

                 TargetLocationMaxErrors -> (string)
                     The maximum number of errors allowed  before  the  system
                     stops  queueing  additional Automation executions for the
