NAME
       create-document -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  Amazon  Web Services Systems Manager (SSM document). An SSM
       document defines the actions that Systems Manager performs on your man-
       aged  nodes. For more information about SSM documents, including infor-
       mation about supported schemas, features, and syntax,  see  Amazon  Web
       Services  Systems  Manager Documents in the Amazon Web Services Systems
       Manager User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-document
          --content <value>
          [--requires <value>]
          [--attachments <value>]
          --name <value>
          [--display-name <value>]
          [--version-name <value>]
          [--document-type <value>]
          [--document-format <value>]
          [--target-type <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --content (string)
          The content for the new SSM document in JSON or YAML format. We rec-
          ommend  storing  the  contents  for your new document in an external
          JSON or YAML file and referencing the file in a command.

          For examples, see the following topics in the  Amazon  Web  Services
          Systems Manager User Guide .

          o Create an SSM document (Amazon Web Services API)

          o Create an SSM document (Amazon Web Services CLI)

          o Create an SSM document (API)

       --requires (list)
          A  list  of  SSM documents required by a document. This parameter is
          used exclusively by AppConfig. When a user creates an AppConfig con-
          figuration in an SSM document, the user must also specify a required
          document for validation purposes. In this case,  an  ApplicationCon-
          figuration document requires an ApplicationConfigurationSchema docu-
          ment for validation purposes. For more information, see What is App-
          Config? in the AppConfig User Guide .

          (structure)
              An SSM document required by the current document.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  required SSM document. The name can be an
                 Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

              Version -> (string)
                 The document version required by the current document.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Version=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Version": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --attachments (list)
          A list of key-value pairs that describe attachments to a version  of
          a document.

          (structure)
              Identifying  information  about a document attachment, including
              the file name and a key-value pair that identifies the  location
              of an attachment to a document.

              Key -> (string)
                 The  key  of a key-value pair that identifies the location of
                 an attachment to a document.

              Values -> (list)
                 The value of a key-value pair that identifies the location of
                 an  attachment to a document. The format for Value depends on
                 the type of key you specify.

                 o For the key SourceUrl , the value is an S3 bucket location.
                   For      example:       "Values":     [     "s3://doc-exam-
                   ple-bucket/my-folder" ]

                 o For the key S3FileUrl , the  value  is  a  file  in  an  S3
                   bucket.   For   example:    "Values":   [   "s3://doc-exam-
                   ple-bucket/my-folder/my-file.py" ]

                 o For the key AttachmentReference , the value is  constructed
                   from  the  name  of another SSM document in your account, a
                   version number of that document, and  a  file  attached  to
                   that  document version that you want to reuse. For example:
                   "Values": [ "MyOtherDocument/3/my-other-file.py"  ]    How-
                   ever,  if  the SSM document is shared with you from another
                   account, the  full  SSM  document  ARN  must  be  specified
                   instead  of the document name only. For example:  "Values":
                   [     "arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:111122223333:document/OtherAc-
                   countDocument/3/their-file.py" ]

                 (string)

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the document attachment file.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string,Name=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "SourceUrl"|"S3FileUrl"|"AttachmentReference",
              "Values": ["string", ...],
              "Name": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --name (string)
          A name for the SSM document.

          WARNING:
              You  can't  use the following strings as document name prefixes.
              These are reserved by Amazon Web Services for  use  as  document
              name prefixes:

              o aws-

              o amazon

              o amzn

       --display-name (string)
          An  optional field where you can specify a friendly name for the SSM
          document. This value can differ for each version  of  the  document.
          You  can update this value at a later time using the  UpdateDocument
          operation.

       --version-name (string)
          An optional field specifying the version of  the  artifact  you  are
          creating  with  the  document.  For example, "Release 12, Update 6".
          This value is unique across all versions of a document, and can't be
          changed.

       --document-type (string)
          The type of document to create.

          Possible values:

          o Command

          o Policy

          o Automation

          o Session

          o Package

          o ApplicationConfiguration

          o ApplicationConfigurationSchema

          o DeploymentStrategy

          o ChangeCalendar

          o Automation.ChangeTemplate

          o ProblemAnalysis

          o ProblemAnalysisTemplate

       --document-format (string)
          Specify the document format for the request. The document format can
          be JSON, YAML, or TEXT. JSON is the default format.

          Possible values:

          o YAML

          o JSON

          o TEXT

       --target-type (string)
          Specify a target type to define the kinds of resources the  document
          can run on. For example, to run a document on EC2 instances, specify
          the following value: /AWS::EC2::Instance . If you specify a value of
          '/'  the  document  can  run on all types of resources. If you don't
          specify a value, the document can't run on any resources. For a list
          of  valid resource types, see Amazon Web Services resource and prop-
          erty types reference in the CloudFormation User Guide .

       --tags (list)
          Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. Tags enable you  to
          categorize  a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner,
          or environment. For example, you might want to tag an  SSM  document
          to  identify  the  types of targets or the environment where it will
          run. In this case, you could specify the following key-value pairs:

          o Key=OS,Value=Windows

          o Key=Environment,Value=Production

          NOTE:
              To add tags to an existing SSM document, use  the   AddTagsToRe-
              source operation.

          (structure)
              Metadata  that you assign to your Amazon Web Services resources.
              Tags enable you to categorize your resources in different  ways,
              for  example,  by  purpose, owner, or environment. In Amazon Web
              Services Systems Manager, you can apply tags to Systems  Manager
              documents  (SSM  documents), managed nodes, maintenance windows,
              parameters, patch baselines, OpsItems, and OpsMetadata.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
