LIST-DOCUMENTS()                                              LIST-DOCUMENTS()



NAME
       list-documents -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  all  Systems Manager (SSM) documents in the current Amazon Web
       Services account and Amazon Web Services  Region.  You  can  limit  the
       results of this request by using a filter.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-documents  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: DocumentIdentifiers

SYNOPSIS
            list-documents
          [--document-filter-list <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --document-filter-list (list)
          This data type is deprecated. Instead, use Filters .

          (structure)
              This data type is deprecated. Instead,  use   DocumentKeyValues-
              Filter .

              key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

              value -> (string)
                 The value of the filter.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "Name"|"Owner"|"PlatformTypes"|"DocumentType",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --filters (list)
          One  or more DocumentKeyValuesFilter objects. Use a filter to return
          a more specific list of results. For keys, you can  specify  one  or
          more key-value pair tags that have been applied to a document. Other
          valid keys include Owner , Name , PlatformTypes , DocumentType , and
          TargetType   .   For  example,  to  return  documents  you  own  use
          Key=Owner,Values=Self . To specify a custom key-value pair, use  the
          format Key=tag:tagName,Values=valueName .

          NOTE:
              This  API operation only supports filtering documents by using a
              single tag  key  and  one  or  more  tag  values.  For  example:
              Key=tag:tagName,Values=valueName1,valueName2

          (structure)
              One or more filters. Use a filter to return a more specific list
              of documents.

              For keys, you can specify  one  or  more  tags  that  have  been
              applied to a document.

              You  can  also  use  Amazon  Web Services-provided keys, some of
              which have specific allowed values. These keys and their associ-
              ated values are as follows:
                 DocumentType

              o ApplicationConfiguration

              o ApplicationConfigurationSchema

              o Automation

              o ChangeCalendar

              o Command

              o DeploymentStrategy

              o Package

              o Policy

              o Session

                Owner

              Note  that  only  one  Owner  can be specified in a request. For
              example: Key=Owner,Values=Self .

              o Amazon

              o Private

              o Public

              o Self

              o ThirdParty

                PlatformTypes

              o Linux

              o Windows
                 Name is another Amazon Web Services-provided key. If you  use
                 Name  as a key, you can use a name prefix to return a list of
                 documents. For example, in the Amazon Web  Services  CLI,  to
                 return  a  list of all documents that begin with Te , run the
                 following command:

                 aws ssm list-documents --filters Key=Name,Values=Te

              You can also use the  TargetType  Amazon  Web  Services-provided
              key.  For  a list of valid resource type values that can be used
              with this key, see Amazon Web  Services  resource  and  property
              types reference in the CloudFormation User Guide .

              If you specify more than two keys, only documents that are iden-
              tified by all the tags are returned in the results. If you spec-
              ify  more  than two values for a key, documents that are identi-
              fied by any of the values are returned in the results.

              To specify a custom key-value pair, use the format  Key=tag:tag-
              Name,Values=valueName .

              For  example,  if  you created a key called region and are using
              the Amazon Web Services CLI to call the list-documents command:
                 aws   ssm   list-documents   --filters    Key=tag:region,Val-
                 ues=east,west Key=Owner,Values=Self

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter key.

              Values -> (list)
                 The value for the filter key.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                          }
                      ]
                  }
              ]
          }
