DESCRIBE-PATCH-GROUPS()                                DESCRIBE-PATCH-GROUPS()



NAME
       describe-patch-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all patch groups that have been registered with patch baselines.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-patch-groups is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Mappings

SYNOPSIS
            describe-patch-groups
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Each  element  in  the  array  is a structure containing a key-value
          pair.

          Supported keys for DescribePatchGroups include the following:

          o
            **
            NAME_PREFIX **   Sample values: AWS- | My- .

          o
            **
            OPERATING_SYSTEM **   Sample values: AMAZON_LINUX | SUSE | WINDOWS

          (structure)
              Defines  a  filter  used in Patch Manager APIs. Supported filter
              keys depend on the API operation that includes the filter. Patch
              Manager  API operations that use PatchOrchestratorFilter include
              the following:

              o DescribeAvailablePatches

              o DescribeInstancePatches

              o DescribePatchBaselines

              o DescribePatchGroups

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for the filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 The value for the filter.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Mappings -> (list)
          Each entry in the array contains:

          o PatchGroup   :  string  (between  1  and  256  characters.  Regex:
            ^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$)

          o PatchBaselineIdentity : A PatchBaselineIdentity element.

          (structure)
              The mapping between a patch group and  the  patch  baseline  the
              patch group is registered with.

              PatchGroup -> (string)
                 The  name  of the patch group registered with the patch base-
                 line.

              BaselineIdentity -> (structure)
                 The patch baseline the patch group is registered with.

                 BaselineId -> (string)
                     The ID of the patch baseline.

                 BaselineName -> (string)
                     The name of the patch baseline.

                 OperatingSystem -> (string)
                     Defines the operating system the patch  baseline  applies
                     to. The default value is WINDOWS .

                 BaselineDescription -> (string)
                     The description of the patch baseline.

                 DefaultBaseline -> (boolean)
                     Whether this is the default baseline. Amazon Web Services
                     Systems Manager supports creating multiple default  patch
                     baselines.  For  example,  you can create a default patch
                     baseline for each operating system.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use when requesting the next set of items. If there are
          no additional items to return, the string is empty.
