GET-MAINTENANCE-WINDOW-EXECUTION-TASK()GET-MAINTENANCE-WINDOW-EXECUTION-TASK()



NAME
       get-maintenance-window-execution-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  details  about a specific task run as part of a mainte-
       nance window execution.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-maintenance-window-execution-task
          --window-execution-id <value>
          --task-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --window-execution-id (string)
          The ID of the maintenance window execution that includes the task.

       --task-id (string)
          The ID of the specific task execution in the maintenance window task
          that should be retrieved.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about a maintenance window task execution

       The   following   get-maintenance-window-execution-task  example  lists
       information about a task that is part of the specified maintenance win-
       dow execution.

          aws ssm get-maintenance-window-execution-task \
              --window-execution-id "518d5565-5969-4cca-8f0e-da3b2EXAMPLE" \
