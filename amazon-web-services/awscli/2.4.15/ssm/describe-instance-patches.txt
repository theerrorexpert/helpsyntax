DESCRIBE-INSTANCE-PATCHES()                        DESCRIBE-INSTANCE-PATCHES()



NAME
       describe-instance-patches -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information  about the patches on the specified managed node
       and their state relative to the patch baseline being used for the node.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-instance-patches  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: Patches

SYNOPSIS
            describe-instance-patches
          --instance-id <value>
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The ID of the managed node whose patch state information  should  be
          retrieved.

       --filters (list)
          Each  element  in  the  array  is a structure containing a key-value
          pair.

          Supported keys for DescribeInstancePatches include the following:

          o
            **
            Classification **   Sample values: Security | SecurityUpdates

          o
            **
            KBId **   Sample values: KB4480056 | java-1.7.0-openjdk.x86_64

          o
            **
            Severity **   Sample values: Important | Medium | Low

          o
            **
            State **   Sample values: Installed | InstalledOther |  Installed-
            PendingReboot

          (structure)
              Defines  a  filter  used in Patch Manager APIs. Supported filter
              keys depend on the API operation that includes the filter. Patch
              Manager  API operations that use PatchOrchestratorFilter include
              the following:

              o DescribeAvailablePatches

              o DescribeInstancePatches

              o DescribePatchBaselines

              o DescribePatchGroups

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for the filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 The value for the filter.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              --filters Key=State,Values=Missing

       Output:

          {
            "Patches": [
                {
                    "Title": "Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool x64 - February 2019 (KB890830)",
