NAME
       describe-maintenance-window-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the tasks in a maintenance window.

       NOTE:
          For  maintenance  window tasks without a specified target, you can't
          supply values for --max-errors and --max-concurrency . Instead,  the
          system  inserts  a placeholder value of 1 , which may be reported in
          the response to this command. These values don't affect the  running
          of your task and can be ignored.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-maintenance-window-tasks  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: Tasks

SYNOPSIS
            describe-maintenance-window-tasks
          --window-id <value>
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --window-id (string)
          The ID of the maintenance window whose tasks should be retrieved.

       --filters (list)
          Optional filters used to narrow  down  the  scope  of  the  returned
          tasks. The supported filter keys are WindowTaskId , TaskArn , Prior-
          ity , and TaskType .

          (structure)
              Filter used in the request. Supported filter keys depend on  the
              API  operation that includes the filter. API operations that use
              MaintenanceWindowFilter> include the following:

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowExecutions

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowExecutionTaskInvocations

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowExecutionTasks

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindows

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowTargets

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowTasks

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Tasks -> (list)
          Information about the tasks in the maintenance window.

          (structure)
              Information about a task defined for a maintenance window.

              WindowId -> (string)
                 The ID of the maintenance window where  the  task  is  regis-
                 tered.

              WindowTaskId -> (string)
                 The task ID.

              TaskArn -> (string)
                 The  resource  that  the  task  uses  during  execution.  For
                 RUN_COMMAND and AUTOMATION task types, TaskArn is the  Amazon
                 Web  Services Systems Manager (SSM document) name or ARN. For
                 LAMBDA tasks, it's the function name or ARN.  For  STEP_FUNC-
                 TIONS tasks, it's the state machine ARN.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of task.

              Targets -> (list)
                 The targets (either managed nodes or tags). Managed nodes are
                 specified using Key=instanceids,Values=<instanceid1>,<instan-
                 ceid2>  . Tags are specified using Key=<tag name>,Values=<tag
                 value> .

                 (structure)
                     An array of search criteria that  targets  managed  nodes
                     using a key-value pair that you specify.

                     NOTE:
                        One  or more targets must be specified for maintenance
                        window Run Command-type tasks. Depending on the  task,
                        targets are optional for other maintenance window task
                        types (Automation, Lambda, and  Step  Functions).  For
                        more  information about running tasks that don't spec-

                     o Key=tag:<my-tag-key>,Val-
                       ues=<my-tag-value-1>,<my-tag-value-2>

                     o Key=tag-key,Values=<my-tag-key-1>,<my-tag-key-2>

                     o Run Command  and  Maintenance  window  targets  only  :
                       Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=<resource-group-name>

                     o Maintenance       window       targets      only      :
                       Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Val-

                     o Run Command  and  Maintenance  window  targets  only  :
                       Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=ProductionResourceGroup
                       This example demonstrates how to target  all  resources
                       in  the  resource group ProductionResourceGroup in your
                       maintenance window.

                     o Maintenance      window      targets       only       :
                       Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Val-
                       ues=AWS::EC2::INSTANCE,AWS::EC2::VPC     This   example
                       demonstrates  how to target only Amazon Elastic Compute
                       Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and VPCs in  your  mainte-
                       nance window.

                     o Automation   targets   only   :  Key=ResourceGroup,Val-
                       ues=MyResourceGroup

                     o State Manager association targets  only  :  Key=Instan-
                       ceIds,Values=*    This example demonstrates how to tar-
                       get all managed instances in the  Amazon  Web  Services
                       Region where the association was created.

                     For more information about how to send commands that tar-
                     get  managed  nodes  using  Key,Value   parameters,   see
                     Targeting  multiple  instances in the Amazon Web Services
                     Systems Manager User Guide .

                     Key -> (string)
                        User-defined criteria for sending commands that target
                        managed nodes that meet the criteria.

                     Values -> (list)
                        User-defined  criteria that maps to Key . For example,
                        if you specified tag:ServerRole ,  you  could  specify
                        value:WebServer  to  run  a  command on instances that
                        include EC2 tags of ServerRole,WebServer .

                        Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of
                        values  for a key might be lower than the global maxi-
                        mum of 50.

                        (string)

              TaskParameters -> (map)
                 The parameters that should be passed to the task when  it  is
                 run.

                 NOTE:
                     TaskParameters has been deprecated. To specify parameters
                     to pass to a task when it runs, instead use  the  Parame-
                     ters  option  in  the TaskInvocationParameters structure.
