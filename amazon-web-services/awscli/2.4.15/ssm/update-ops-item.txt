OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          Update the information about the OpsItem. Provide enough information
          so that users reading this OpsItem for the first time understand the
          issue.

       --operational-data (map)
          Add new keys or edit existing key-value pairs of the OperationalData
          map in the OpsItem object.

          Operational  data  is  custom  data  that  provides useful reference
          details about the OpsItem. For example, you can specify  log  files,
          error strings, license keys, troubleshooting tips, or other relevant
          data. You enter operational data as key-value pairs. The key  has  a
          maximum length of 128 characters. The value has a maximum size of 20
          KB.

          WARNING:
              Operational data keys can't begin with the following:  amazon  ,
              aws , amzn , ssm , /amazon , /aws , /amzn , /ssm .

          You  can  choose  to  make the data searchable by other users in the
          account or you can restrict search  access.  Searchable  data  means
          that all users with access to the OpsItem Overview page (as provided
          by the  DescribeOpsItems API operation) can view and search  on  the
          specified data. Operational data that isn't searchable is only view-
          able by users who have access to the OpsItem  (as  provided  by  the
          GetOpsItem API operation).

          Use  the  /aws/resources key in OperationalData to specify a related
          resource in the request. Use  the  /aws/automations  key  in  Opera-
          tionalData  to  associate an Automation runbook with the OpsItem. To
          view Amazon Web Services CLI example commands that use  these  keys,
          see  Creating  OpsItems  manually in the Amazon Web Services Systems
          Manager User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
