GET-INVENTORY()                                                GET-INVENTORY()



NAME
       get-inventory -

DESCRIPTION
       Query inventory information. This includes managed node status, such as
       Stopped or Terminated .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-inventory is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Entities

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)

          results.

          (structure)
              One or more filters. Use a filter to return a more specific list
              of results.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter key.

              Values -> (list)
                 Inventory filter values. Example: inventory filter where man-
                 aged node IDs are specified as values  Key=AWS:InstanceInfor-
                 mation.InstanceId,Values=                     i-a12b3c4d5e6g,
                 i-1a2b3c4d5e6,Type=Equal .

                 (string)

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of filter.

                 NOTE:
                     The Exists filter must be used with aggregators. For more
                     information, see Aggregating inventory data in the Amazon
                     Web Services Systems Manager User Guide .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string,Type=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...],
              "Type": "Equal"|"NotEqual"|"BeginWith"|"LessThan"|"GreaterThan"|"Exists"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --aggregators (list)
          Returns counts of inventory types based on one or more  expressions.
          For  example,  if you aggregate by using an expression that uses the
          AWS:InstanceInformation.PlatformType type, you can see  a  count  of
          how  many  Windows and Linux managed nodes exist in your inventoried
          fleet.

          (structure)
              Specifies the inventory type and attribute for  the  aggregation
              execution.

              Expression -> (string)
                 The inventory type and attribute name for aggregation.

              Aggregators -> (list)
                 Nested  aggregators  to  further  refine  aggregation  for an
                 inventory type.

                 (structure)
                     Specifies the inventory type and attribute for the aggre-
                     gation execution.

                     Expression -> (string)
                        The inventory type and attribute name for aggregation.

                     Groups -> (list)
                        A user-defined set of one or more filters on which  to
                        aggregate  inventory  data.  Groups  return a count of
                        resources that match and  don't  match  the  specified
                        criteria.

                            to aggregate inventory data. Groups return a count
                            of resources that match and don't match the speci-
                            fied criteria.

                               Filters define the criteria for the group.  The
                               matchingCount  field  displays  the  number  of
                               resources that match  the  criteria.  The  not-
                               MatchingCount  field  displays  the  number  of
                               resources that don't match the criteria.

                                      tory filter where managed node  IDs  are
                                      specified  as values Key=AWS:InstanceIn-
                                      formation.InstanceId,Values=
                                      i-a12b3c4d5e6g, i-1a2b3c4d5e6,Type=Equal
                                      .

                                          The Exists filter must be used  with
                                          aggregators.  For  more information,
                                          see Aggregating  inventory  data  in

                 A user-defined set of one or more filters on which to  aggre-
                 gate  inventory data. Groups return a count of resources that

                     Filters -> (list)
                        Filters  define the criteria for the group. The match-
                        ingCount field displays the number of  resources  that
                        match  the  criteria.  The notMatchingCount field dis-
                        plays the number of resources  that  don't  match  the

                        (structure)
                            One or more filters. Use a filter to return a more

       --result-attributes (list)
          The list of inventory item types to return.

          (structure)
              The inventory item result attribute.

              TypeName -> (string)
                 Name of the inventory item type. Valid value: AWS:InstanceIn-
                 formation . Default Value: AWS:InstanceInformation .

       JSON Syntax:

          [

            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.
