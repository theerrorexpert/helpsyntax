DELETE-ASSOCIATION()                                      DELETE-ASSOCIATION()



NAME
       delete-association -

DESCRIPTION
       Disassociates  the  specified Amazon Web Services Systems Manager docu-
       ment (SSM document) from the specified managed node. If you created the
       association  by  using  the Targets parameter, then you must delete the
       association by using the association ID.

       When you disassociate a document from a managed node, it doesn't change
       the  configuration  of the node. To change the configuration state of a
       managed node after you disassociate a document, you must create  a  new
       document with the desired configuration and associate it with the node.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-association
          [--name <value>]
          [--instance-id <value>]
          [--association-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the SSM document.

       --instance-id (string)
          The managed node ID.

          NOTE:
              InstanceId has been deprecated. To specify a managed node ID for
              an association, use the Targets parameter. Requests that include
              the parameter InstanceID with  Systems  Manager  documents  (SSM
              documents)  that  use  schema version 2.0 or later will fail. In
              addition, if you use the parameter InstanceId ,  you  can't  use
              the  parameters  AssociationName , DocumentVersion , MaxErrors ,
              MaxConcurrency , OutputLocation , or ScheduleExpression . To use
              these parameters, you must use the Targets parameter.

       --association-id (string)
          The association ID that you want to delete.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To delete an association using the association ID

       The  following  delete-association  example deletes the association for
       the specified association ID. There is no output if  the  command  suc-
       ceeds.

          aws ssm delete-association \
              --association-id "8dfe3659-4309-493a-8755-0123456789ab"

       This command produces no output.

       association in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.

       Example 2: To delete an association

       The  following  delete-association  example  deletes  the   association
       between  an  instance and a document. There is no output if the command
       succeeds.

          aws ssm delete-association \
              --instance-id "i-1234567890abcdef0" \
              --name "AWS-UpdateSSMAgent"

       This command produces no output.
