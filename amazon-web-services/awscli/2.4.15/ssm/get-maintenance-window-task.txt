GET-MAINTENANCE-WINDOW-TASK()                    GET-MAINTENANCE-WINDOW-TASK()



NAME
       get-maintenance-window-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the tasks in a maintenance window.

       NOTE:
          For  maintenance  window tasks without a specified target, you can't
          supply values for --max-errors and --max-concurrency . Instead,  the
          system  inserts  a placeholder value of 1 , which may be reported in
          the response to this command. These values don't affect the  running
          of your task and can be ignored.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-maintenance-window-task
          --window-id <value>
          --window-task-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --window-id (string)
          The maintenance window ID that includes the task to retrieve.

       --window-task-id (string)
          The maintenance window task ID to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       WindowId -> (string)
          The retrieved maintenance window ID.

       WindowTaskId -> (string)
          The retrieved maintenance window task ID.

       Targets -> (list)
          The targets where the task should run.

          (structure)
              An  array  of search criteria that targets managed nodes using a
              key-value pair that you specify.

              NOTE:
                 One or more targets must be specified for maintenance  window
                 Run  Command-type  tasks.  Depending on the task, targets are
                 optional for other maintenance window task types (Automation,
                 Lambda,  and Step Functions). For more information about run-
                 ning tasks that don't specify targets, see Registering  main-
                 tenance  window  tasks without targets in the Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices Systems Manager User Guide .

              Supported formats include the following.

              o Key=InstanceIds,Val-
                ues=<instance-id-1>,<instance-id-2>,<instance-id-3>

              o Key=tag:<my-tag-key>,Values=<my-tag-value-1>,<my-tag-value-2>

              o Key=tag-key,Values=<my-tag-key-1>,<my-tag-key-2>

              o Run   Command   and   Maintenance   window   targets   only  :
                Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=<resource-group-name>

              o Maintenance        window        targets        only         :
                Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Val-
                ues=<resource-type-1>,<resource-type-2>

              o Automation    targets    only     :     Key=ResourceGroup;Val-
                ues=<resource-group-name>

              For example:

              o Key=InstanceIds,Values=i-02573cafcfEXAMPLE,i-0471e04240EXAM-
                PLE,i-07782c72faEXAMPLE

              o Key=tag:CostCenter,Values=CostCenter1,CostCenter2,CostCenter3

              o Key=tag-key,Values=Name,Instance-Type,CostCenter

              o Run  Command   and   Maintenance   window   targets   only   :
                Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=ProductionResourceGroup   This
                example demonstrates  how  to  target  all  resources  in  the
                resource  group  ProductionResourceGroup  in  your maintenance
                window.

              o Maintenance        window        targets        only         :
                Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Val-
                ues=AWS::EC2::INSTANCE,AWS::EC2::VPC    This  example   demon-
                strates  how to target only Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Ama-
                zon EC2) instances and VPCs in your maintenance window.

              o Automation targets only : Key=ResourceGroup,Values=MyResource-
                Group

              o State  Manager association targets only : Key=InstanceIds,Val-
                ues=*   This example demonstrates how to  target  all  managed
                instances in the Amazon Web Services Region where the associa-
                tion was created.

              For more information about how to send commands that target man-
              aged  nodes  using  Key,Value parameters, see Targeting multiple
              instances in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User  Guide
              .

              Key -> (string)
                 User-defined  criteria  for sending commands that target man-
                 aged nodes that meet the criteria.

              Values -> (list)
                 User-defined criteria that maps to Key . For example, if  you
                 specified  tag:ServerRole , you could specify value:WebServer
                 to run a command  on  instances  that  include  EC2  tags  of
                 ServerRole,WebServer .

                 Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of values
                 for a key might be lower than the global maximum of 50.

                 (string)

       TaskArn -> (string)
          The resource that the task used during  execution.  For  RUN_COMMAND
          and  AUTOMATION task types, the value of TaskArn is the SSM document
          name/ARN. For LAMBDA tasks, the value is the function name/ARN.  For
          STEP_FUNCTIONS tasks, the value is the state machine ARN.

       ServiceRoleArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management
          (IAM) service role to use to publish Amazon Simple Notification Ser-
          vice  (Amazon  SNS) notifications for maintenance window Run Command
          tasks.

       TaskType -> (string)
          The type of task to run.

       TaskParameters -> (map)
          The parameters to pass to the task when it runs.

          NOTE:
              TaskParameters has been deprecated.  To  specify  parameters  to
              pass  to  a task when it runs, instead use the Parameters option
              in the TaskInvocationParameters structure. For information about
              how  Systems  Manager  handles  these  options for the supported
              maintenance window task types, see  MaintenanceWindowTaskInvoca-
              tionParameters .

                     The  name of the CloudWatch Logs log group where you want
                     to send command output. If  you  don't  specify  a  group
                     name,  Amazon  Web Services Systems Manager automatically
                     creates a log group for you. The log group uses the  fol-
                     lowing naming format:

                        ``
                        aws/ssm/SystemsManagerDocumentName ``

                 CloudWatchOutputEnabled -> (boolean)
                     Enables  Systems Manager to send command output to Cloud-
                     Watch Logs.

              DocumentHash -> (string)

                 ument was created. SHA-1 hashes have been deprecated.

              DocumentHashType -> (string)
                 SHA-256 or SHA-1. SHA-1 hashes have been deprecated.

              DocumentVersion -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web Services Systems Manager document (SSM docu-
                 ment) version to use in the request. You can specify $DEFAULT
                 , $LATEST , or a specific version number. If you run commands
                 by using the Amazon Web Services CLI, then  you  must  escape
                 the  first two options by using a backslash. If you specify a
                 version number, then you don't need to use the backslash. For
                 example:
                     --document-version "\$DEFAULT"

                     --document-version "\$LATEST"

                        logs, instead  use  the  OutputS3BucketName  and  Out-
                        putS3KeyPrefix options in the TaskInvocationParameters
                        structure. For information about how Amazon  Web  Ser-
                        vices  Systems  Manager  handles these options for the
                        supported maintenance window task types, see   Mainte-
                        nanceWindowTaskInvocationParameters .

                        TaskParameters has been deprecated. To specify parame-
                        ters to pass to a task when it runs, instead  use  the
                        Parameters   option  in  the  TaskInvocationParameters
                        structure. For information about how  Systems  Manager
                        handles  these  options  for the supported maintenance
                        window task types,  see   MaintenanceWindowTaskInvoca-
                        tionParameters .

                     For  AUTOMATION  task  types, Amazon Web Services Systems
                     Manager ignores any values specified  for  these  parame-
                     ters.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (list)
                     (string)

          StepFunctions -> (structure)
              The parameters for a STEP_FUNCTIONS task type.

              Input -> (string)
                 The inputs for the STEP_FUNCTIONS task.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the STEP_FUNCTIONS task.

          Lambda -> (structure)
              The parameters for a LAMBDA task type.

              ClientContext -> (string)
                 Pass  client-specific information to the Lambda function that
                 you are invoking. You can then process the client information
                 in  your  Lambda  function  as you choose through the context
                 variable.

              Qualifier -> (string)
                 (Optional) Specify an Lambda function version or alias  name.
                 If  you  specify  a  function version, the operation uses the
                 qualified function Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  to  invoke  a
                 specific  Lambda  function. If you specify an alias name, the
                 operation uses the alias ARN to invoke  the  Lambda  function
                 version to which the alias points.

              Payload -> (blob)
                 JSON to provide to your Lambda function as input.

       Priority -> (integer)
          The  priority  of  the  task when it runs. The lower the number, the
          higher the priority. Tasks that have the same priority are scheduled
          in parallel.

       MaxConcurrency -> (string)
          The  maximum number of targets allowed to run this task in parallel.

          NOTE:
              For maintenance window tasks without  a  target  specified,  you
              can't  supply  a  value  for  this  option.  Instead, the system
              inserts a placeholder value of 1 , which may be reported in  the
              response  to this command. This value doesn't affect the running
              of your task and can be ignored.

       MaxErrors -> (string)
          The maximum number of errors allowed before  the  task  stops  being
          scheduled.

          NOTE:
              For  maintenance  window  tasks  without a target specified, you
              can't supply a  value  for  this  option.  Instead,  the  system
              inserts  a placeholder value of 1 , which may be reported in the
              response to this command. This value doesn't affect the  running
              of your task and can be ignored.

       LoggingInfo -> (structure)
          The  location in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) where the
          task results are logged.

          NOTE:
              LoggingInfo has been deprecated. To  specify  an  Amazon  Simple
              Storage  Service (Amazon S3) bucket to contain logs, instead use
              the OutputS3BucketName  and  OutputS3KeyPrefix  options  in  the
              TaskInvocationParameters  structure.  For  information about how
              Amazon Web Services Systems Manager handles  these  options  for
              the  supported  maintenance  window  task  types,  see   Mainte-
              nanceWindowTaskInvocationParameters .

          S3BucketName -> (string)
              The name of an S3 bucket where execution logs are stored .

          S3KeyPrefix -> (string)
              (Optional) The S3 bucket subfolder.

          S3Region -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services Region where the S3 bucket is located.

       Name -> (string)
          The retrieved task name.

       Description -> (string)
          The retrieved task description.

       CutoffBehavior -> (string)
          The action to take on tasks when the maintenance window cutoff  time
          is  reached. CONTINUE_TASK means that tasks continue to run. For Au-
          tomation, Lambda, Step Functions tasks, CANCEL_TASK means that  cur-
          rently  running  task  invocations continue, but no new task invoca-
          tions are started. For Run Command tasks, CANCEL_TASK means the sys-
          tem  attempts to stop the task by sending a CancelCommand operation.
