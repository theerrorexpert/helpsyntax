NAME
       describe-maintenance-window-targets -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the targets registered with the maintenance window.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-maintenance-window-targets  is a paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: Targets

SYNOPSIS
            describe-maintenance-window-targets
          --window-id <value>
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --window-id (string)
          The ID of the maintenance window whose targets should be  retrieved.

       --filters (list)
          Optional  filters  that  can be used to narrow down the scope of the
          returned window targets. The supported filter keys are Type  ,  Win-
          dowTargetId , and OwnerInformation .

          (structure)
              Filter  used in the request. Supported filter keys depend on the
              API operation that includes the filter. API operations that  use
              MaintenanceWindowFilter> include the following:

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowExecutions

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowExecutionTaskInvocations

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowExecutionTasks

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindows

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowTargets

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowTasks

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       Example 2: To list all targets for a maintenance window matching a spe-
       cific owner information value

       This describe-maintenance-window-targets example lists all of the  tar-
       gets for a maintenance window with a specific value.

              --window-id "mw-0ecb1226ddEXAMPLE" \
              --filters "Key=OwnerInformation,Values=CostCenter1"

                 nance window.

              Targets -> (list)
                 The targets, either managed nodes or tags.

                        window Run Command-type tasks. Depending on the  task,
                        targets are optional for other maintenance window task
                        types (Automation, Lambda, and  Step  Functions).  For
                        more  information about running tasks that don't spec-

                     o Maintenance       window       targets      only      :
                       Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Val-
                       ues=<resource-type-1>,<resource-type-2>

                     o Automation   targets   only   :  Key=ResourceGroup;Val-

                       PLE,i-0471e04240EXAMPLE,i-07782c72faEXAMPLE

                     o Key=tag:CostCenter,Values=CostCenter1,CostCenter2,Cost-
                       Center3

                     o Key=tag-key,Values=Name,Instance-Type,CostCenter

                     o Run Command  and  Maintenance  window  targets  only  :
                       Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=ProductionResourceGroup
                       This example demonstrates how to target  all  resources
                       in  the  resource group ProductionResourceGroup in your
                       maintenance window.

                     o Maintenance      window      targets       only       :
                       Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Val-
                       ues=AWS::EC2::INSTANCE,AWS::EC2::VPC     This   example
                       demonstrates  how to target only Amazon Elastic Compute
                       Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and VPCs in  your  mainte-
                       nance window.

                     o Automation   targets   only   :  Key=ResourceGroup,Val-
                       ues=MyResourceGroup

                     o State Manager association targets  only  :  Key=Instan-
                       ceIds,Values=*    This example demonstrates how to tar-
                       get all managed instances in the  Amazon  Web  Services
                       Region where the association was created.

                     For more information about how to send commands that tar-
                     get  managed  nodes  using  Key,Value   parameters,   see
                     Targeting  multiple  instances in the Amazon Web Services
                     Systems Manager User Guide .

                     Key -> (string)
                        User-defined criteria for sending commands that target
                        managed nodes that meet the criteria.

                     Values -> (list)
                        User-defined  criteria that maps to Key . For example,
                        if you specified tag:ServerRole ,  you  could  specify
                        value:WebServer  to  run  a  command on instances that
                        include EC2 tags of ServerRole,WebServer .

                        Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of
                        values  for a key might be lower than the global maxi-
                        mum of 50.

                        (string)

              OwnerInformation -> (string)
                 A user-provided value that will be  included  in  any  Amazon
                 CloudWatch  Events events that are raised while running tasks
                 for these targets in this maintenance window.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name for the maintenance window target.

              Description -> (string)
                 A description for the target.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use when requesting the next set of items. If there are
          no additional items to return, the string is empty.
