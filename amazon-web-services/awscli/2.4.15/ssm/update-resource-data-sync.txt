UPDATE-RESOURCE-DATA-SYNC()                        UPDATE-RESOURCE-DATA-SYNC()



NAME
       update-resource-data-sync -

DESCRIPTION
       Update  a resource data sync. After you create a resource data sync for
       a Region, you can't change the account options for that sync. For exam-
       ple, if you create a sync in the us-east-2 (Ohio) Region and you choose
       the Include only the current account option, you can't edit  that  sync
       later and choose the Include all accounts from my Organizations config-
       uration option. Instead, you must delete the first resource data  sync,
       and create a new one.

       NOTE:
          This  API operation only supports a resource data sync that was cre-
          ated with a SyncFromSource SyncType .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-resource-data-sync
          --sync-name <value>
          --sync-type <value>
          --sync-source <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --sync-name (string)
          The name of the resource data sync you want to update.

       --sync-type (string)
          The type of resource data sync. The supported SyncType is  SyncFrom-
          Source.

       --sync-source (structure)
          Specify information about the data sources to synchronize.

          SourceType -> (string)
              The  type  of data source for the resource data sync. SourceType
              is either AwsOrganizations (if an  organization  is  present  in
              Organizations) or SingleAccountMultiRegions .

          AwsOrganizationsSource -> (structure)
              Information  about the AwsOrganizationsSource resource data sync
              source. A sync source of this type  can  synchronize  data  from
              Organizations.

              OrganizationSourceType -> (string)
                 If  an  Amazon  Web Services organization is present, this is
                 either OrganizationalUnits or EntireOrganization . For  Orga-
                 nizationalUnits  , the data is aggregated from a set of orga-
                 nization units. For EntireOrganization , the data  is  aggre-
                 gated from the entire Amazon Web Services organization.

              OrganizationalUnits -> (list)
                 The Organizations organization units included in the sync.

                 (structure)
                     The Organizations organizational unit data source for the
                     sync.

                     OrganizationalUnitId -> (string)
                        The Organizations unit ID data source for the sync.

          SourceRegions -> (list)
              The SyncSource Amazon  Web  Services  Regions  included  in  the
              resource data sync.

              (string)

          IncludeFutureRegions -> (boolean)
              Whether to automatically synchronize and aggregate data from new
              Amazon Web Services Regions when those Regions come online.

          EnableAllOpsDataSources -> (boolean)
              When you create a resource data sync, if you choose one  of  the
              Organizations   options,   then  Systems  Manager  automatically
              enables all OpsData sources in the selected Amazon Web  Services
              Regions  for  all Amazon Web Services accounts in your organiza-
              tion (or in the selected organization units). For more  informa-
              tion,  see About multiple account and Region resource data syncs
              in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide .

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SourceType": "string",
            "AwsOrganizationsSource": {
              "OrganizationSourceType": "string",
              "OrganizationalUnits": [
                {
                  "OrganizationalUnitId": "string"
                }
                ...
              ]
            },
            "SourceRegions": ["string", ...],
            "IncludeFutureRegions": true|false,
            "EnableAllOpsDataSources": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update a resource data sync

       The following update-resource-data-sync  example  updates  a  SyncFrom-
       Source resource data sync.

          aws ssm update-resource-data-sync \
              --sync-name exampleSync \
              --sync-type SyncFromSource \
              --sync-source '{"SourceType":"SingleAccountMultiRegions", "SourceRegions":["us-east-1", "us-west-2"]}'

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       None
