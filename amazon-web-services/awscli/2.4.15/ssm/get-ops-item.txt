NAME
       get-ops-item -

DESCRIPTION
       Get information about an OpsItem by using the ID. You must have permis-
       sion in Identity and Access Management (IAM) to view information  about
       an OpsItem. For more information, see Getting started with OpsCenter in
       the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide .

       Operations engineers and IT professionals use Amazon Web Services  Sys-
       tems  Manager OpsCenter to view, investigate, and remediate operational
       issues impacting the performance and health of their  Amazon  Web  Ser-
       vices  resources. For more information, see OpsCenter in the Amazon Web
       Services Systems Manager User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-ops-item
          --ops-item-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --ops-item-id (string)
          The ID of the OpsItem that you want to get.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              pairs. The key has a maximum length of 128 characters. The value
              has a maximum size of 20 KB.

              WARNING:
                 Operational data keys can't begin with the following:  amazon
                 , aws , amzn , ssm , /amazon , /aws , /amzn , /ssm .

              You can choose to make the data searchable by other users in the
              account or you can restrict search access. Searchable data means
              that all users with access to the OpsItem Overview page (as pro-
              vided by the   DescribeOpsItems  API  operation)  can  view  and
              search  on  the  specified  data.  Operational  data  that isn't
              searchable is only viewable by users  who  have  access  to  the
              OpsItem (as provided by the  GetOpsItem API operation).

              Use  the  /aws/resources  key  in  OperationalData  to specify a
              related resource in the request. Use the /aws/automations key in
              OperationalData  to  associate  an  Automation  runbook with the
              OpsItem. To view Amazon Web Services CLI example  commands  that
              use these keys, see Creating OpsItems manually in the Amazon Web
              Services Systems Manager User Guide .
