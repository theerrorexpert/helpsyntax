NAME
       list-ops-item-related-items -

DESCRIPTION

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-ops-item-related-items  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: Summaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-ops-item-related-items
          [--ops-item-id <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --ops-item-id (string)
          The ID of the OpsItem for which you want to  list  all  related-item
          resources.

       --filters (list)
          One  or more OpsItem filters. Use a filter to return a more specific
          list of results.

          (structure)
              Describes  a  filter  for  a  specific  list   of   related-item
              resources.

              Key -> (string)
                 The   name  of  the  filter  key.  Supported  values  include
                 ResourceUri , ResourceType , or AssociationId .

              Values -> (list)
                 The values for the filter.

                 (string)

              Operator -> (string)
                 The operator used by the  filter  call.  The  only  supported
                 operator is EQUAL .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string,Operator=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "ResourceType"|"AssociationId"|"ResourceUri",
              "Values": ["string", ...],
              "Operator": "Equal"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
