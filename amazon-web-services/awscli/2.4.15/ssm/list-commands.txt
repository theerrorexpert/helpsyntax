LIST-COMMANDS()                                                LIST-COMMANDS()



NAME
       list-commands -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  commands  requested  by  users  of  the Amazon Web Services
       account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-commands is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Commands

SYNOPSIS
            list-commands
          [--command-id <value>]
          [--instance-id <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --command-id (string)
          (Optional) If provided, lists only the specified command.

       --instance-id (string)
          (Optional) Lists commands issued against this managed node ID.

          NOTE:
              You can't specify a managed node ID in the same command that you
              specify Status = Pending . This is because  the  command  hasn't
              reached the managed node yet.

       --filters (list)
          (Optional)  One  or more filters. Use a filter to return a more spe-
          cific list of results.

          (structure)
              Describes a command filter.

              NOTE:
                 A managed node ID can't be specified when a command status is
                 Pending because the command hasn't run on the node yet.

              key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

                 NOTE:
                     The ExecutionStage filter can't be used with the ListCom-
                     mandInvocations operation, only with ListCommands .

              value -> (string)
                 The filter value. Valid values for each  filter  key  are  as
                 follows:

                 o InvokedAfter  :  Specify a timestamp to limit your results.
                   For example, specify 2021-07-07T00:00:00Z to see a list  of
                   command executions occurring July 7, 2021, and later.

                 o InvokedBefore  : Specify a timestamp to limit your results.
                   For example, specify 2021-07-07T00:00:00Z to see a list  of
                   command executions from before July 7, 2021.

                 o Status  :  Specify  a valid command status to see a list of
                   all command executions with that status. The status choices
                   depend on the API you call. The status values you can spec-
                   ify for ListCommands are:

                   o Pending

                   o InProgress

                   o Success

                   o Cancelled

                   o Failed

                   o TimedOut (this includes both Delivery and Execution  time
                     outs)

                   o AccessDenied

                   o DeliveryTimedOut

                   o ExecutionTimedOut

                   o Incomplete

                   o NoInstancesInTag

                   o LimitExceeded

                 The  status values you can specify for ListCommandInvocations
                 are:

                     o Pending

                     o InProgress

                     o Delayed

                     o Success

                     o Cancelled

                     o Failed

                     o TimedOut (this includes  both  Delivery  and  Execution
                       time outs)

                     o AccessDenied

                     o DeliveryTimedOut

                     o ExecutionTimedOut

                     o Undeliverable

                     o InvalidPlatform

                     o Terminated

                 o DocumentName : Specify name of the Amazon Web Services Sys-
                   tems Manager document (SSM document) for which you want  to
                   see   command   execution  results.  For  example,  specify
                   AWS-RunPatchBaseline to see command  executions  that  used
                   this  SSM  document to perform security patching operations
                   on managed nodes.

                 o ExecutionStage : Specify one of the following values (List-
                   Commands operations only):

                   o Executing : Returns a list of command executions that are
                     currently still running.

                   o Complete : Returns a list of command executions that have
                     already completed.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "InvokedAfter"|"InvokedBefore"|"Status"|"ExecutionStage"|"DocumentName",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

                       Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=ProductionResourceGroup
                       This example demonstrates how to target  all  resources
                       in  the  resource group ProductionResourceGroup in your
                       maintenance window.

                     o Maintenance      window      targets       only       :

                       ues=AWS::EC2::INSTANCE,AWS::EC2::VPC     This   example
                       demonstrates  how to target only Amazon Elastic Compute
                       Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and VPCs in  your  mainte-
                       nance window.

                       ceIds,Values=*    This example demonstrates how to tar-
                       get all managed instances in the  Amazon  Web  Services
                       Region where the association was created.

                     For more information about how to send commands that tar-
                     get  managed  nodes  using  Key,Value   parameters,   see
                     Targeting  multiple  instances in the Amazon Web Services
                     Systems Manager User Guide .

                     Key -> (string)
                        User-defined criteria for sending commands that target
                        managed nodes that meet the criteria.

                     Values -> (list)
                        User-defined  criteria that maps to Key . For example,
                        if you specified tag:ServerRole ,  you  could  specify
                        value:WebServer  to  run  a  command on instances that
                        include EC2 tags of ServerRole,WebServer .

                        Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of
                        values  for a key might be lower than the global maxi-
                        mum of 50.

                        (string)

              RequestedDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the command was requested.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the command.

              StatusDetails -> (string)
                 A detailed status of  the  command  execution.  StatusDetails
                 includes  more  information  than  Status because it includes
                 states resulting from error and concurrency  control  parame-
                 ters.  StatusDetails  can show different results than Status.
                 For more information about these statuses, see  Understanding
                 command  statuses  in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager
                 User Guide . StatusDetails can be one of the  following  val-
                 ues:

                 o Pending: The command hasn't been sent to any managed nodes.

                 o In Progress: The command has been sent to at least one man-
                   aged  node  but hasn't reached a final state on all managed
                   nodes.

                 o Success: The command successfully ran on  all  invocations.
                   This is a terminal state.

                 o Delivery  Timed Out: The value of MaxErrors or more command
                   invocations shows a status of Delivery Timed Out. This is a
                   terminal state.

                 o Execution Timed Out: The value of MaxErrors or more command
                   invocations shows a status of Execution Timed Out. This  is
                   a terminal state.

                 o Failed:  The value of MaxErrors or more command invocations
                   shows a status of Failed. This is a terminal state.

                 o Incomplete: The command was attempted on all managed  nodes
                   and one or more invocations doesn't have a value of Success
                   but not enough invocations failed  for  the  status  to  be
                   Failed. This is a terminal state.

                 o Cancelled:  The  command  was terminated before it was com-
                   pleted. This is a terminal state.

                 o Rate Exceeded: The number of managed nodes targeted by  the
                   command exceeded the account limit for pending invocations.
                   The system has canceled the command before  running  it  on
                   any managed node. This is a terminal state.

              OutputS3Region -> (string)
                 (Deprecated)  You  can  no longer specify this parameter. The
                 system ignores it.  Instead,  Systems  Manager  automatically
                 determines the Amazon Web Services Region of the S3 bucket.

              OutputS3BucketName -> (string)
                 The  S3  bucket where the responses to the command executions
                 should be stored. This was requested when  issuing  the  com-
                 mand.

              OutputS3KeyPrefix -> (string)
                 The  S3  directory path inside the bucket where the responses
                 to  the  command  executions  should  be  stored.  This   was
                 requested when issuing the command.

              MaxConcurrency -> (string)
                 The  maximum  number of managed nodes that are allowed to run
                 the command at the same time. You can  specify  a  number  of
                 managed  nodes, such as 10, or a percentage of nodes, such as
                 10%. The default value is 50. For more information about  how
                 to  use  MaxConcurrency  , see Running commands using Systems
                 Manager Run Command in the Amazon Web Services  Systems  Man-
                 ager User Guide .

              MaxErrors -> (string)
                 The  maximum number of errors allowed before the system stops
                 sending the command to additional targets. You can specify  a
                 number of errors, such as 10, or a percentage or errors, such
                 as 10%. The default value is 0 . For more  information  about
                 how  to  use  MaxErrors  , see Running commands using Systems
                 Manager Run Command in the Amazon Web Services  Systems  Man-
                 ager User Guide .

                 The number of targets for the command.

              CompletedCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  targets  for  which  the  command invocation
                 reached a terminal state. Terminal states include the follow-
                 ing:  Success,  Failed,  Execution  Timed Out, Delivery Timed
                 Out, Cancelled, Terminated, or Undeliverable.
