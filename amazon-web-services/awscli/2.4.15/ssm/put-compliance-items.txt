PUT-COMPLIANCE-ITEMS()                                  PUT-COMPLIANCE-ITEMS()



NAME
       put-compliance-items -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers  a  compliance  type and other compliance details on a desig-
       nated resource. This operation  lets  you  register  custom  compliance
       details  with  a  resource.  This  call  overwrites existing compliance
       information on the resource, so you must provide a full list of compli-
       ance items each time that you send the request.

       ComplianceType can be one of the following:

       o ExecutionId:  The execution ID when the patch, association, or custom
         compliance item was applied.

       o ExecutionType: Specify patch, association, or Custom:string .

       o ExecutionTime. The time the patch, association, or custom  compliance
         item was applied to the managed node.

       o Id: The patch, association, or custom compliance ID.

       o Title: A title.

       o Status:  The status of the compliance item. For example, approved for
         patches, or Failed for associations.

       o Severity: A patch severity. For example, critical .

       o DocumentName: An SSM document name. For example, AWS-RunPatchBaseline
         .

       o DocumentVersion: An SSM document version number. For example, 4.

       o Classification: A patch classification. For example, security updates
         .

       o PatchBaselineId: A patch baseline ID.

       o PatchSeverity: A patch severity. For example, Critical .

       o PatchState: A patch state. For example, InstancesWithFailedPatches  .

       o PatchGroup: The name of a patch group.

       o InstalledTime:  The time the association, patch, or custom compliance
         item was applied to the resource. Specify the time by using the  fol-
         lowing format: yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'

SYNOPSIS
            put-compliance-items
          --resource-id <value>
          --resource-type <value>
          --compliance-type <value>
          --execution-summary <value>
          --items <value>
          [--item-content-hash <value>]
          [--upload-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-id (string)
          Specify  an  ID  for  this resource. For a managed node, this is the
          node ID.

       --resource-type (string)
          Specify the type of resource. ManagedInstance is currently the  only
          supported resource type.

       --compliance-type (string)
          Specify the compliance type. For example, specify Association (for a
          State Manager association), Patch, or Custom:string .

       --execution-summary (structure)
          A summary of the call execution that includes an execution  ID,  the
          type  of execution (for example, Command ), and the date/time of the
          execution using a datetime object that is  saved  in  the  following
          format: yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'.

          ExecutionTime -> (timestamp)
              The time the execution ran as a datetime object that is saved in
              the following format: yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'.

          ExecutionId -> (string)
              An ID created by the system when PutComplianceItems was  called.
              For example, CommandID is a valid execution ID. You can use this
              ID in subsequent calls.

          ExecutionType -> (string)
              The type of execution. For example, Command is a valid execution
              type.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ExecutionTime=timestamp,ExecutionId=string,ExecutionType=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ExecutionTime": timestamp,
            "ExecutionId": "string",
            "ExecutionType": "string"
          }

       --items (list)
          Information  about  the  compliance as defined by the resource type.
          For example, for a patch compliance type, Items includes information
          about the PatchSeverity, Classification, and so on.

          (structure)
              Information about a compliance item.

              Id -> (string)
                 The  compliance  item ID. For example, if the compliance item
                 is a Windows patch, the ID could be  the  number  of  the  KB
                 article.

              Title -> (string)
                 The title of the compliance item. For example, if the compli-
                 ance item is a Windows patch, the title could be the title of
                 the  KB  article  for the patch; for example: Security Update
                 for Active Directory Federation Services.

              Severity -> (string)
                 The severity of the compliance status. Severity can be one of
                 the  following:  Critical,  High, Medium, Low, Informational,
                 Unspecified.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the compliance item. An item is either  COMPLI-
                 ANT or NON_COMPLIANT.

              Details -> (map)
                 A "Key": "Value" tag combination for the compliance item.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Id=string,Title=string,Severity=string,Status=string,Details={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Id": "string",
              "Title": "string",
              "Severity": "CRITICAL"|"HIGH"|"MEDIUM"|"LOW"|"INFORMATIONAL"|"UNSPECIFIED",
              "Status": "COMPLIANT"|"NON_COMPLIANT",
              "Details": {"string": "string"
                ...}
            }
            ...
          ]

       --item-content-hash (string)
          MD5  or  SHA-256 content hash. The content hash is used to determine
          if existing information should be overwritten  or  ignored.  If  the
          content  hashes  match, the request to put compliance information is
          ignored.

       --upload-type (string)
          The mode for uploading compliance items. You can specify COMPLETE or
          PARTIAL  . In COMPLETE mode, the system overwrites all existing com-
          pliance information for the resource. You must provide a  full  list
          of compliance items each time you send the request.

          In  PARTIAL mode, the system overwrites compliance information for a
          specific association. The association must be configured with  Sync-
          Compliance  set  to  MANUAL  . By default, all requests use COMPLETE
          mode.

          NOTE:
              This attribute is only valid for association compliance.

          Possible values:

          o COMPLETE

          o PARTIAL

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To register a compliance type and compliance details  to  a  designated
       instance

       This example registers the compliance type Custom:AVCheck to the speci-
       fied managed instance. There is no output if the command succeeds.

       Command:

          aws ssm put-compliance-items --resource-id "i-1234567890abcdef0" --resource-type "ManagedInstance" --compliance-type "Custom:AVCheck" --execution-summary "ExecutionTime=2019-02-18T16:00:00Z" --items "Id=Version2.0,Title=ScanHost,Severity=CRITICAL,Status=COMPLIANT"

OUTPUT
       None
