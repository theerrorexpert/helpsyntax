LIST-ASSOCIATION-VERSIONS()                        LIST-ASSOCIATION-VERSIONS()



NAME
       list-association-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves all versions of an association for a specific association ID.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-association-versions is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: AssociationVersions

SYNOPSIS
            list-association-versions
          --association-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --association-id (string)
          The association ID for which you want to view all versions.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                        window Run Command-type tasks. Depending on the  task,
                        targets are optional for other maintenance window task
                        types (Automation, Lambda, and  Step  Functions).  For
                        more  information about running tasks that don't spec-
                        ify targets, see Registering maintenance window  tasks
                        without  targets  in  the  Amazon Web Services Systems
                        Manager User Guide .

                     Supported formats include the following.

                     o Key=tag-key,Values=<my-tag-key-1>,<my-tag-key-2>

                     o Run Command  and  Maintenance  window  targets  only  :
                       Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=<resource-group-name>

                     o Maintenance       window       targets      only      :
                       Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Val-
                       ues=<resource-type-1>,<resource-type-2>

                       ues=<resource-group-name>

                     For example:

                     o Key=InstanceIds,Values=i-02573cafcfEXAM-
                       PLE,i-0471e04240EXAMPLE,i-07782c72faEXAMPLE

                     o Key=tag-key,Values=Name,Instance-Type,CostCenter

                     o Run Command  and  Maintenance  window  targets  only  :
                       Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=ProductionResourceGroup
                       This example demonstrates how to target  all  resources
                       in  the  resource group ProductionResourceGroup in your
                       maintenance window.

                     o Maintenance      window      targets       only       :
                       Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Val-
                       ues=AWS::EC2::INSTANCE,AWS::EC2::VPC     This   example
                       demonstrates  how to target only Amazon Elastic Compute
                       Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and VPCs in  your  mainte-
                       nance window.

                     o Automation   targets   only   :  Key=ResourceGroup,Val-
                       ues=MyResourceGroup

                     o State Manager association targets  only  :  Key=Instan-
                       ceIds,Values=*    This example demonstrates how to tar-
                       get all managed instances in the  Amazon  Web  Services
                       Region where the association was created.

                     For more information about how to send commands that tar-
                     get  managed  nodes  using  Key,Value   parameters,   see
                     Targeting  multiple  instances in the Amazon Web Services
                     Systems Manager User Guide .

                     Key -> (string)
                        User-defined criteria for sending commands that target
                        managed nodes that meet the criteria.

                     Values -> (list)
                        User-defined  criteria that maps to Key . For example,
                        if you specified tag:ServerRole ,  you  could  specify
                        value:WebServer  to  run  a  command on instances that
                        include EC2 tags of ServerRole,WebServer .

                        Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of
                        values  for a key might be lower than the global maxi-
                        mum of 50.

                        (string)

              ScheduleExpression -> (string)
                 The cron or rate schedule specified for the association  when
                 the association version was created.

              OutputLocation -> (structure)
                 The  location in Amazon S3 specified for the association when
                 the association version was created.

                 S3Location -> (structure)
                     An S3 bucket where you want to store the results of  this
                     request.

                     OutputS3Region -> (string)
                        The Amazon Web Services Region of the S3 bucket.

                     OutputS3BucketName -> (string)
                        The name of the S3 bucket.

                     OutputS3KeyPrefix -> (string)
                        The S3 bucket subfolder.

              AssociationName -> (string)
                 The name specified for the association version when the asso-
                 ciation version was created.

              MaxErrors -> (string)
                 The number of errors that are allowed before the system stops
                 sending  requests  to  run the association on additional tar-
                 gets. You can specify either an absolute  number  of  errors,
                 for  example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for exam-
                 ple 10%. If you specify 3,  for  example,  the  system  stops
                 sending  requests  when  the fourth error is received. If you
                 specify 0, then the system stops sending requests  after  the
                 first error is returned. If you run an association on 50 man-
                 aged nodes and set MaxError to 10%,  then  the  system  stops
                 sending the request when the sixth error is received.

                 Executions  that are already running an association when Max-
                 Errors is reached are allowed to complete, but some of  these
                 executions may fail as well. If you need to ensure that there
                 won't be more than max-errors failed executions, set  MaxCon-
                 currency to 1 so that executions proceed one at a time.

              MaxConcurrency -> (string)
                 The  maximum number of targets allowed to run the association
                 at the same time. You can specify a number, for  example  10,
                 or  a  percentage  of  the  target  set, for example 10%. The
                 default value is 100%, which means all targets run the  asso-
                 ciation at the same time.

                 If  a new managed node starts and attempts to run an associa-
                 tion while Systems Manager is running MaxConcurrency associa-
                 tions,  the  association  is  allowed to run. During the next
                 association interval, the new managed node will  process  its
                 association within the limit specified for MaxConcurrency .

              ComplianceSeverity -> (string)
                 The severity level that is assigned to the association.

              SyncCompliance -> (string)
                 The mode for generating association compliance. You can spec-
                 ify AUTO or MANUAL . In AUTO mode, the system uses the status
                 of the association execution to determine the compliance sta-
                 tus. If the association execution runs successfully, then the
                 association  is  COMPLIANT  .  If  the  association execution
                 doesn't run successfully, the association is NON-COMPLIANT  .

                 In  MANUAL  mode,  you  must  specify  the AssociationId as a
                 parameter for the  PutComplianceItems API operation. In  this
                 case, compliance data isn't managed by State Manager, a capa-
                 bility of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager. It is  managed
                 by your direct call to the  PutComplianceItems API operation.

                 By default, all associations use AUTO mode.

              ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval -> (boolean)
                 By default, when you create a new  associations,  the  system
                 runs it immediately after it is created and then according to
                 the schedule you specified. Specify this option if you  don't
                 want  an  association to run immediately after you create it.
                 This parameter isn't supported for rate expressions.

              CalendarNames -> (list)
                 The names or Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the Change  Cal-
                 endar  type  documents your associations are gated under. The
                 associations for this version only run when that Change  Cal-
                 endar  is open. For more information, see Amazon Web Services
                 Systems Manager Change Calendar .

                 (string)

              TargetLocations -> (list)
                 The combination of Amazon Web Services Regions and Amazon Web
                 Services  accounts  where  you  wanted to run the association
                 when this association version was created.

                 (structure)
                     The combination of Amazon Web Services Regions and Amazon
                     Web  Services accounts targeted by the current Automation
                     execution.

                     Accounts -> (list)
                        The Amazon Web Services accounts targeted by the  cur-
                        rent Automation execution.

                        (string)

                     Regions -> (list)
                        The  Amazon  Web Services Regions targeted by the cur-
                        rent Automation execution.

                        (string)

                     TargetLocationMaxConcurrency -> (string)
                        The maximum number of Amazon Web Services Regions  and
                        Amazon  Web Services accounts allowed to run the Auto-
                        mation concurrently.

                     TargetLocationMaxErrors -> (string)
                        The maximum number of errors allowed before the system
                        stops  queueing  additional  Automation executions for
                        the currently running Automation.

                     ExecutionRoleName -> (string)
