NAME
       get-automation-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Get detailed information about a particular Automation execution.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-automation-execution
          --automation-execution-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --automation-execution-id (string)
          The  unique identifier for an existing automation execution to exam-
          ine. The execution ID is returned by  StartAutomationExecution  when
          the execution of an Automation runbook is initiated.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     value -> (list)
                        (string)

                 IsEnd -> (boolean)

                 IsCritical -> (boolean)
                     The flag which can be used to  help  decide  whether  the
                     failure  of current step leads to the Automation failure.

                 ValidNextSteps -> (list)
                     Strategies used when step fails, we support Continue  and
                     Abort.  Abort  will  fail  the  automation  when the step
                     fails. Continue will ignore the failure of  current  step
                     and  allow  automation  to run the next step. With condi-
                     tional branching, we add step:stepName to support the au-
                     tomation to go to another specific step.

                     (structure)
                        An array of search criteria that targets managed nodes
                        using a key-value pair that you specify.

                        NOTE:
                            One or more targets must be specified for  mainte-

                     values  for  a key might be lower than the global maximum
                     of 50.
