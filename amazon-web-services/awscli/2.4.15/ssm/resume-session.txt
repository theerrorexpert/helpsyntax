RESUME-SESSION()                                              RESUME-SESSION()



NAME
       resume-session -

DESCRIPTION
       Reconnects  a session to a managed node after it has been disconnected.
       Connections can be resumed for disconnected sessions,  but  not  termi-
       nated sessions.

       NOTE:
          This  command  is  primarily for use by client machines to automati-
          cally  reconnect  during  intermittent  network  issues.  It   isn't
          intended for any other use.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            resume-session
          --session-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --session-id (string)
          The ID of the disconnected session to resume.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To resume a Session Manager session

       This  resume-session  example resumes a Session Manager session with an
       instance after it has been disconnected.  Note  that  this  interactive
       command  requires  the  Session  Manager  plugin to be installed on the
       client machine making the call.

          aws ssm resume-session \
              --session-id Mary-Major-07a16060613c408b5

       Output:

          {
