       Delete  a  custom  inventory  type or the data associated with a custom
       Inventory type. Deleting a custom inventory type is also referred to as
       deleting a custom inventory schema.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-inventory
          --type-name <value>
          [--schema-delete-option <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --type-name (string)
          The  name  of the custom inventory type for which you want to delete
          either all previously collected data or the inventory type itself.

       --schema-delete-option (string)
          Use  the  SchemaDeleteOption  to  delete  a  custom  inventory  type
          (schema).  If  you don't choose this option, the system only deletes
          existing inventory data associated with the custom  inventory  type.
          Choose one of the following options:

          DisableSchema:  If  you  choose  this option, the system ignores all
          inventory data for the specified version, and any earlier  versions.
          To  enable  this schema again, you must call the PutInventory opera-
          tion for a version greater than the disabled version.

          DeleteSchema: This option deletes the specified custom type from the
          Inventory service. You can recreate the schema later, if you want.

          Possible values:

          o DisableSchema

          o DeleteSchema

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Use  this  option  to view a summary of the deletion request without
          deleting any data or the data type. This option is useful  when  you
          only want to understand what will be deleted. Once you validate that
          the data to be deleted is what you intend to delete, you can run the
          same command without specifying the DryRun option.

       --client-token (string)
          User-provided idempotency token.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a custom inventory type

       This example deletes a custom inventory schema.

       Command:

          aws ssm delete-inventory --type-name "Custom:RackInfo" --schema-delete-option "DeleteSchema"

       Output:

          {
            "DeletionId": "d72ac9e8-1f60-4d40-b1c6-bf8c78c68c4d",
            "TypeName": "Custom:RackInfo",
            "DeletionSummary": {
                "TotalCount": 1,
                "RemainingCount": 1,
                "SummaryItems": [
                    {
                        "Version": "1.0",
                        "Count": 1,
                        "RemainingCount": 1
                    }
                ]
            }
          }

       To disable a custom inventory type

       This example disables a custom inventory schema.

       Command:

          aws ssm delete-inventory --type-name "Custom:RackInfo" --schema-delete-option "DisableSchema"

       Output:

          {
            "DeletionId": "6961492a-8163-44ec-aa1e-923364dd0850",
            "TypeName": "Custom:RackInformation",
            "DeletionSummary": {
                "TotalCount": 0,
                "RemainingCount": 0,
                "SummaryItems": []
            }
          }

OUTPUT
       DeletionId -> (string)
          Every DeleteInventory operation is assigned a unique ID. This option
          returns a unique ID. You can use this ID to query the  status  of  a
          delete  operation.  This option is useful for ensuring that a delete
          operation has completed before you begin other operations.

       TypeName -> (string)
          The name of the inventory data type specified in the request.

       DeletionSummary -> (structure)
          A summary of the delete operation. For more information  about  this
          summary,  see  Deleting  custom inventory in the Amazon Web Services
          Systems Manager User Guide .

          TotalCount -> (integer)
              The total number of items to delete. This count  doesn't  change
              during the delete operation.

          RemainingCount -> (integer)
              Remaining number of items to delete.

          SummaryItems -> (list)
              A list of counts and versions for deleted items.

              (structure)
                 Either  a  count,  remaining  count, or a version number in a
                 delete inventory summary.

                 Version -> (string)
                     The inventory type version.

                 Count -> (integer)
                     A count of the number of deleted items.

                 RemainingCount -> (integer)
                     The remaining number of items to delete.
