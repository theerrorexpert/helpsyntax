GET-CALENDAR-STATE()                                      GET-CALENDAR-STATE()



NAME
       get-calendar-state -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the state of a Amazon Web Services Systems Manager change calendar
       at the current time or a specified time. If you specify a time, GetCal-
       endarState returns the state of the calendar at that specific time, and
       returns the next time that the change calendar state  will  transition.
       If  you  don't  specify a time, GetCalendarState uses the current time.
       Change Calendar entries have two possible states: OPEN or CLOSED .

       If you specify more than one calendar in a request, the command returns
       the  status  of  OPEN only if all calendars in the request are open. If
       one or more calendars in the request are closed, the status returned is
       CLOSED .

       For  more information about Change Calendar, a capability of Amazon Web
       Services Systems Manager,  see  Amazon  Web  Services  Systems  Manager
       Change Calendar in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            get-calendar-state
          --calendar-names <value>
          [--at-time <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --calendar-names (list)
          The names or Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)  of  the  Systems  Manager
          documents  (SSM  documents)  that represent the calendar entries for
          which you want to get the state.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --at-time (string)
          (Optional) The specific time for which  you  want  to  get  calendar
          state  information, in ISO 8601 format. If you don't specify a value
          or AtTime , the current time is used.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To get the current state of a change calendar

       This get-calendar-state example returns the state of a calendar at  the
       current  time.  Because the example doesn't specify a time, the current
       state of the calendar is reported.

          aws ssm get-calendar-state \
              --calendar-names "MyCalendar"

       Output:

          {
              "State": "OPEN",
              "AtTime": "2020-02-19T22:28:51Z",
              "NextTransitionTime": "2020-02-24T21:15:19Z"
          }

       Example 2: To get the state of a change calendar at a specified time

       This get-calendar-state example returns the state of a calendar at  the
       specified time.

          aws ssm get-calendar-state \
              --calendar-names "MyCalendar" \
              --at-time "2020-07-19T21:15:19Z"

       Output:

          {
              "State": "CLOSED",
              "AtTime": "2020-07-19T21:15:19Z"
          }

       AWS Systems Manager User Guide.

OUTPUT
       State -> (string)
          The state of the calendar. An OPEN calendar indicates  that  actions
          are allowed to proceed, and a CLOSED calendar indicates that actions
          aren't allowed to proceed.

       AtTime -> (string)
          The time, as an ISO 8601 string, that you specified in your command.
          If you don't specify a time, GetCalendarState uses the current time.

       NextTransitionTime -> (string)
          The time, as an ISO  8601  string,  that  the  calendar  state  will
          change.  If  the current calendar state is OPEN , NextTransitionTime
          indicates  when  the  calendar  state  changes  to  CLOSED   ,   and
          vice-versa.
