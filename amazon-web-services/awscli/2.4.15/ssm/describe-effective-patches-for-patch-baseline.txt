DESCRIBE-EFFECTIVE-PATCHES-FOR-DESCRIBE-EFFECTIVE-PATCHES-FOR-PATCH-BASELINE()



NAME
       describe-effective-patches-for-patch-baseline -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  current  effective  patches (the patch and the approval
       state) for the specified patch baseline. Applies to patch baselines for
       Windows only.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-effective-patches-for-patch-baseline is a paginated operation.
       Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the  entire  data
       set  of results. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-pagi-
       nate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on  a
       paginated  response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the
       results of the following query expressions: EffectivePatches

SYNOPSIS
            describe-effective-patches-for-patch-baseline
          --baseline-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --baseline-id (string)
          The ID of the patch baseline to retrieve the effective patches  for.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To get all patches defined by a custom patch baseline

       The  following  describe-effective-patches-for-patch-baseline   example
       returns  the  patches defined by a custom patch baseline in the current
       AWS account. Note that for a custom baseline, only the ID  is  required
       for --baseline-id.

          aws ssm describe-effective-patches-for-patch-baseline \
              --baseline-id "pb-08b654cf9b9681f04"
