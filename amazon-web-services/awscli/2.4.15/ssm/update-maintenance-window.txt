UPDATE-MAINTENANCE-WINDOW()                        UPDATE-MAINTENANCE-WINDOW()



NAME
       update-maintenance-window -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  an  existing maintenance window. Only specified parameters are
       modified.

       NOTE:
          The value you specify for Duration determines the specific end  time
          for  the  maintenance window based on the time it begins. No mainte-
          nance window tasks are permitted to start after the  resulting  end-
          time minus the number of hours you specify for Cutoff . For example,
          if the maintenance window starts at 3  PM,  the  duration  is  three
          hours,  and the value you specify for Cutoff is one hour, no mainte-
          nance window tasks can start after 5 PM.

OPTIONS
       --window-id (string)
          The ID of the maintenance window to update.

       --name (string)
          The name of the maintenance window.

       --description (string)
          An optional description for the update request.

       --start-date (string)
          The time zone that the scheduled maintenance window  executions  are
          based  on, in Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) format. For
          example: "America/Los_Angeles", "UTC",  or  "Asia/Seoul".  For  more
          information, see the Time Zone Database on the IANA website.

       --end-date (string)
          The  date  and  time, in ISO-8601 Extended format, for when you want
          the maintenance window to become inactive. EndDate allows you to set
          a  date  and  time in the future when the maintenance window will no
          longer run.

       --schedule (string)
          The schedule of the maintenance window in the form of a cron or rate
          expression.

       --schedule-timezone (string)
          The  time  zone that the scheduled maintenance window executions are
          based on, in Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) format.  For
          example:  "America/Los_Angeles",  "UTC",  or  "Asia/Seoul". For more
          information, see the Time Zone Database on the IANA website.

       --schedule-offset (integer)
          The number of days to wait after the date and time  specified  by  a
          cron expression before running the maintenance window.

          For  example,  the following cron expression schedules a maintenance
          window to run the third Tuesday of every month at 11:30 PM.
              cron(30 23 ? * TUE#3 *)

          If the schedule offset is 2 , the maintenance window won't run until
          two days later.

       --duration (integer)
          The duration of the maintenance window in hours.

       --cutoff (integer)
          The  number  of  hours before the end of the maintenance window that
          Amazon Web Services Systems Manager stops scheduling new  tasks  for
          execution.

       --allow-unassociated-targets      |     --no-allow-unassociated-targets
       (boolean)
          Whether targets must  be  registered  with  the  maintenance  window
          before tasks can be defined for those targets.

       --enabled | --no-enabled (boolean)
          Whether the maintenance window is enabled.

       --replace | --no-replace (boolean)
          If  True  ,  then all fields that are required by the  CreateMainte-
          nanceWindow operation  are  also  required  for  this  API  request.
          Optional fields that aren't specified are set to null.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To update a maintenance window

       The  following  update-maintenance-window example updates the name of a
       maintenance window.

              --window-id "mw-1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9" \
              --name "My-Renamed-MW"

       Output:

          {
              "Cutoff": 1,
              "Name": "My-Renamed-MW",
              "Schedule": "cron(0 16 ? * TUE *)",
              "Enabled": true,

              "Duration": 4
          }

       Example 2: To disable a maintenance window

       The following update-maintenance-window example disables a  maintenance
       window.

          aws ssm update-maintenance-window \
              --window-id "mw-1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9" \
              --no-enabled

       Example 3: To enable a maintenance window

       The  following  update-maintenance-window example enables a maintenance
       window.

          aws ssm update-maintenance-window \
              --window-id "mw-1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9" \
              --enabled
