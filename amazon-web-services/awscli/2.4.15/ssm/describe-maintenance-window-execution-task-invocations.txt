DESCRIBE-MAINTENANCE-WDESCRIBE-MAINTENANCE-WINDOW-EXECUTION-TASK-INVOCATIONS()



NAME
       describe-maintenance-window-execution-task-invocations -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the individual task executions (one per target) for a partic-
       ular task run as part of a maintenance window execution.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-maintenance-window-execution-task-invocations is  a  paginated
       operation.  Multiple  API  calls may be issued in order to retrieve the
       entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the
       --no-paginate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argu-
       ment on a paginated response, the --query argument  must  extract  data
       from  the  results of the following query expressions: WindowExecution-
       TaskInvocationIdentities

SYNOPSIS
            describe-maintenance-window-execution-task-invocations
          --window-execution-id <value>
          --task-id <value>
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --window-execution-id (string)
          The ID of the maintenance window execution the task is part of.

       --task-id (string)
          The ID of the specific task in  the  maintenance  window  task  that
          should be retrieved.

       --filters (list)
          Optional  filters  used to scope down the returned task invocations.
          The supported filter key is STATUS  with  the  corresponding  values
          PENDING  , IN_PROGRESS , SUCCESS , FAILED , TIMED_OUT , CANCELLING ,
          and CANCELLED .

          (structure)
              Filter used in the request. Supported filter keys depend on  the
              API  operation that includes the filter. API operations that use
              MaintenanceWindowFilter> include the following:

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowExecutions

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowExecutionTaskInvocations

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowExecutionTasks

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindows

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowTargets

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowTasks

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
