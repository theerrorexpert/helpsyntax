NAME
       describe-document-permission -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  permissions  for  a Amazon Web Services Systems Manager
       document (SSM document). If you  created  the  document,  you  are  the
       owner.  If  a document is shared, it can either be shared privately (by
       specifying a user's Amazon Web Services account ID) or publicly (All ).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-document-permission
          --name <value>
          --permission-type <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the document for which you are the owner.

       --permission-type (string)
          The  permission  type  for  the document. The permission type can be
          Share .

          Possible values:

          o Share

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of items to return for this call. The  call  also
          returns a token that you can specify in a subsequent call to get the
          next set of results.

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next set of items to return.  (You  received  this
          token from a previous call.)

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       The  following describe-document-permission example displays permission
       details about a Systems Manager document that is shared publicly.

          aws ssm describe-document-permission \
              --name "Example" \
              --permission-type "Share"

       Output:

          {
              "AccountIds": [
                  "all"
              ],
              "AccountSharingInfoList": [
                  {
                      "AccountId": "all",
                      "SharedDocumentVersion": "$DEFAULT"
                  }
              ]
          }
