DESCRIBE-ACTIVATIONS()                                  DESCRIBE-ACTIVATIONS()



NAME
       describe-activations -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  details  about the activation, such as the date and time the
       activation was created, its expiration date, the  Identity  and  Access
       Management  (IAM) role assigned to the managed nodes in the activation,
       and the number of nodes registered by using this activation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-activations is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: ActivationList

SYNOPSIS
            describe-activations
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          A filter to view information about your activations.

          (structure)
              Filter for the DescribeActivation API.

              FilterKey -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

              FilterValues -> (list)
                 The filter values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FilterKey=string,FilterValues=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "FilterKey": "ActivationIds"|"DefaultInstanceName"|"IamRole",
              "FilterValues": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ActivationList -> (list)
          A list of activations for your Amazon Web Services account.

          (structure)
              An activation registers one or more on-premises servers or  vir-
              tual  machines  (VMs)  with  Amazon Web Services so that you can
              configure those servers or VMs using Run Command. A server or VM
              that  has  been registered with Amazon Web Services Systems Man-
              ager is called a managed node.

              ActivationId -> (string)
                 The ID created by Systems  Manager  when  you  submitted  the
                 activation.

              Description -> (string)
                 A user defined description of the activation.

              DefaultInstanceName -> (string)
                 A name for the managed node when it is created.

              IamRole -> (string)
                 The  Identity  and  Access Management (IAM) role to assign to
                 the managed node.

              RegistrationLimit -> (integer)
                 The maximum number of managed nodes that  can  be  registered
                 using this activation.

              RegistrationsCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  managed  nodes  already registered with this
                 activation.

              ExpirationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date when this activation can no longer be used to regis-
                 ter managed nodes.

              Expired -> (boolean)
                 Whether or not the activation is expired.

              CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date the activation was created.

              Tags -> (list)
                 Tags assigned to the activation.

                 (structure)
                     Metadata  that  you  assign  to  your Amazon Web Services
                     resources. Tags enable you to categorize  your  resources
                     in  different  ways,  for  example, by purpose, owner, or
                     environment. In Amazon Web Services Systems Manager,  you
                     can  apply  tags  to Systems Manager documents (SSM docu-
                     ments), managed nodes, maintenance  windows,  parameters,
                     patch baselines, OpsItems, and OpsMetadata.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The name of the tag.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of items to return. Use this token to get
          the next set of results.
