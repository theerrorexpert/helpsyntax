LIST-COMMAND-INVOCATIONS()                          LIST-COMMAND-INVOCATIONS()



NAME
       list-command-invocations -

DESCRIPTION
       An  invocation  is copy of a command sent to a specific managed node. A
       command can apply to one or more managed nodes.  A  command  invocation
       applies  to  one  managed node. For example, if a user runs SendCommand
       against three managed nodes, then a command invocation is  created  for
       each  requested  managed node ID. ListCommandInvocations provide status
       about command execution.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-command-invocations is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: CommandInvocations

            list-command-invocations
          [--command-id <value>]
          [--instance-id <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--details | --no-details]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]

OPTIONS
       --command-id (string)
          (Optional) The invocations for a specific command ID.

       --instance-id (string)
          (Optional) The command execution details for a specific managed node
          ID.

       --filters (list)
          (Optional) One or more filters. Use a filter to return a  more  spe-
          cific list of results.

          (structure)
              Describes a command filter.

              NOTE:
                 A managed node ID can't be specified when a command status is
                 Pending because the command hasn't run on the node yet.

              key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

                 NOTE:
                     The ExecutionStage filter can't be used with the ListCom-
                     mandInvocations operation, only with ListCommands .

              value -> (string)
                 The  filter  value.  Valid  values for each filter key are as
                 follows:

                 o InvokedAfter : Specify a timestamp to limit  your  results.
                   For  example, specify 2021-07-07T00:00:00Z to see a list of
                   command executions occurring July 7, 2021, and later.

                 o InvokedBefore : Specify a timestamp to limit your  results.
                   For  example, specify 2021-07-07T00:00:00Z to see a list of
                   command executions from before July 7, 2021.

                 o Status : Specify a valid command status to see  a  list  of
                   all command executions with that status. The status choices
                   depend on the API you call. The status values you can spec-
                   ify for ListCommands are:

                   o Pending

                   o InProgress

                   o Success

                   o Cancelled

                   o Failed

                   o TimedOut  (this includes both Delivery and Execution time
                     outs)

                   o AccessDenied

                   o DeliveryTimedOut

                   o ExecutionTimedOut

                   o Incomplete

                   o NoInstancesInTag

                   o LimitExceeded

                 The status values you can specify for  ListCommandInvocations
                 are:

                     o Pending

                     o InProgress

                     o Delayed

                     o Success

                     o Cancelled

                     o Failed

                     o TimedOut  (this  includes  both  Delivery and Execution
                       time outs)

                     o AccessDenied

                     o DeliveryTimedOut

                     o ExecutionTimedOut

                     o Undeliverable

                     o InvalidPlatform

                     o Terminated

                 o DocumentName : Specify name of the Amazon Web Services Sys-
                   tems  Manager document (SSM document) for which you want to
                   see  command  execution  results.  For   example,   specify
                   AWS-RunPatchBaseline  to  see  command executions that used
                   this SSM document to perform security  patching  operations
                   on managed nodes.

                 o ExecutionStage : Specify one of the following values (List-
                   Commands operations only):

                   o Executing : Returns a list of command executions that are
                     currently still running.

                   o Complete : Returns a list of command executions that have
                     already completed.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "InvokedAfter"|"InvokedBefore"|"Status"|"ExecutionStage"|"DocumentName",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --details | --no-details (boolean)
          (Optional) If set this returns the response of  the  command  execu-
          tions and any command output. The default value is false .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CommandInvocations -> (list)
          (Optional) A list of all invocations.

          (structure)
              An invocation is a copy of a command sent to a specific  managed
              node.  A  command can apply to one or more managed nodes. A com-
              mand invocation applies to one managed node. For example,  if  a
              user  runs  SendCommand against three managed nodes, then a com-
              mand invocation is created for each requested managed node ID. A
              command invocation returns status and detail information about a
              command you ran.

              CommandId -> (string)
                 The command against which this invocation was requested.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The managed node ID in which this invocation was requested.

              InstanceName -> (string)
                 The fully qualified host name of the managed node.

              Comment -> (string)
                 User-specified information about the command, such as a brief
                 description of what the command should do.

              DocumentName -> (string)
                 The document name that was requested for execution.

              DocumentVersion -> (string)
                 The Systems Manager document (SSM document) version.

              RequestedDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time and date the request was sent to this managed node.

              Status -> (string)
                 Whether or not the invocation succeeded, failed, or is  pend-
                 ing.

              StatusDetails -> (string)
                 A  detailed  status of the command execution for each invoca-
                 tion (each managed node targeted by the  command).  StatusDe-
                 tails  includes  more  information  than  Status  because  it
                 includes states resulting from error and concurrency  control
                 parameters.  StatusDetails  can  show  different results than
                 Status.  For  more  information  about  these  statuses,  see
                 Understanding  command  statuses  in  the Amazon Web Services
                 Systems Manager User Guide . StatusDetails can be one of  the
                 following values:

                 o Pending:  The command hasn't been sent to the managed node.

                 o In Progress: The command has been sent to the managed  node
                   but hasn't reached a terminal state.

                 o Success:  The  execution  of the command or plugin was suc-
                   cessfully completed. This is a terminal state.

                 o Delivery Timed Out: The command  wasn't  delivered  to  the
                   managed  node before the delivery timeout expired. Delivery
                   timeouts don't count against the parent command's MaxErrors
                   limit, but they do contribute to whether the parent command
                   status is Success or Incomplete. This is a terminal  state.

                 o Execution  Timed Out: Command execution started on the man-
                   aged node, but the execution  wasn't  complete  before  the
                   execution timeout expired. Execution timeouts count against
                   the MaxErrors limit of the parent command. This is a termi-
                   nal state.

                 o Failed:  The command wasn't successful on the managed node.
                   For a plugin, this indicates that the  result  code  wasn't
                   zero.  For  a  command  invocation, this indicates that the
                   result code for one or more plugins wasn't zero. Invocation
                   failures  count  against  the MaxErrors limit of the parent
                   command. This is a terminal state.

                 o Cancelled: The command was terminated before  it  was  com-
                   pleted. This is a terminal state.

                 o Undeliverable:  The  command can't be delivered to the man-
                   aged node. The managed node might not exist or might not be
                   responding.  Undeliverable  invocations don't count against
                   the parent command's MaxErrors limit and  don't  contribute
                   to  whether  the parent command status is Success or Incom-
                   plete. This is a terminal state.

                 o Terminated: The parent command exceeded its MaxErrors limit
                   and  subsequent  command  invocations  were canceled by the
                   system. This is a terminal state.

              TraceOutput -> (string)
                 Gets the trace output sent by the agent.

              StandardOutputUrl -> (string)
                 The URL to the plugin's StdOut file in Amazon Simple  Storage
                 Service  (Amazon  S3),  if  the S3 bucket was defined for the
                 parent command. For an invocation, StandardOutputUrl is popu-
                 lated  if  there  is just one plugin defined for the command,
                 and the S3 bucket was defined for the command.

              StandardErrorUrl -> (string)
                 The URL to the plugin's StdErr file in Amazon Simple  Storage
                 Service  (Amazon  S3),  if  the S3 bucket was defined for the
                 parent command. For an invocation, StandardErrorUrl is  popu-
                 lated  if  there  is just one plugin defined for the command,
                 and the S3 bucket was defined for the command.

              CommandPlugins -> (list)
                 Plugins processed by the command.

                 (structure)
                     Describes plugin details.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the plugin. Must be one of the  following:
                        aws:updateAgent  , aws:domainjoin , aws:applications ,
                        aws:runPowerShellScript ,  aws:psmodule  ,  aws:cloud-
                        Watch , aws:runShellScript , or aws:updateSSMAgent .

                     Status -> (string)
                        The status of this plugin. You can run a document with
                        multiple plugins.

                     StatusDetails -> (string)
                        A detailed status of the plugin  execution.  StatusDe-
                        tails includes more information than Status because it
                        includes states resulting from error  and  concurrency
                        control  parameters.  StatusDetails can show different
                        results than Status. For more information about  these
                        statuses,  see  Understanding  command statuses in the
                        Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide .  Sta-
                        tusDetails can be one of the following values:

                        o Pending: The command hasn't been sent to the managed
                          node.

                        o In Progress: The command has been sent to  the  man-
                          aged node but hasn't reached a terminal state.

                        o Success:  The execution of the command or plugin was
                          successfully completed. This is a terminal state.

                        o Delivery Timed Out: The command wasn't delivered  to
                          the   managed   node  before  the  delivery  timeout
                          expired. Delivery timeouts don't count  against  the
                          parent  command's  MaxErrors limit, but they do con-
                          tribute to whether the parent command status is Suc-
                          cess or Incomplete. This is a terminal state.

                        o Execution  Timed  Out:  Command execution started on
                          the managed node, but the execution wasn't  complete
                          before  the  execution  timeout  expired.  Execution
                          timeouts count against the MaxErrors  limit  of  the
                          parent command. This is a terminal state.

                        o Failed: The command wasn't successful on the managed
                          node. For a plugin, this indicates that  the  result
                          code  wasn't  zero.  For  a command invocation, this
                          indicates that the result code for one or more plug-
                          ins  wasn't  zero. Invocation failures count against
                          the MaxErrors limit of the parent command. This is a
                          terminal state.

                        o Cancelled:  The command was terminated before it was
                          completed. This is a terminal state.

                        o Undeliverable: The command can't be delivered to the
                          managed  node.  The managed node might not exist, or
                          it might not be  responding.  Undeliverable  invoca-
                          tions  don't count against the parent command's Max-
                          Errors limit, and they don't contribute  to  whether
                          the  parent command status is Success or Incomplete.
                          This is a terminal state.

                        o Terminated: The parent command exceeded  its  MaxEr-
                          rors  limit  and subsequent command invocations were
                          canceled by the system. This is a terminal state.

                     ResponseCode -> (integer)
                        A numeric response code generated  after  running  the
                        plugin.

                     ResponseStartDateTime -> (timestamp)
                        The time the plugin started running.

                     ResponseFinishDateTime -> (timestamp)
                        The time the plugin stopped running. Could stop prema-
                        turely if, for example, a cancel command was sent.

                     Output -> (string)
                        Output of the plugin execution.

                     StandardOutputUrl -> (string)
                        The URL for the complete text written by the plugin to
                        stdout  in Amazon S3. If the S3 bucket for the command
                        wasn't specified, then this string is empty.

                     StandardErrorUrl -> (string)
                        The URL for the complete text written by the plugin to
                        stderr.  If  execution  isn't  yet complete, then this
                        string is empty.

                     OutputS3Region -> (string)
                        (Deprecated) You can no longer specify this parameter.
                        The  system  ignores  it. Instead, Amazon Web Services
                        Systems Manager automatically determines the S3 bucket
                        region.

                     OutputS3BucketName -> (string)
                        The  S3 bucket where the responses to the command exe-
                        cutions should be  stored.  This  was  requested  when
                        issuing  the  command.  For  example, in the following
                        response:
                            doc-example-bucket/ab19cb99-a030-46dd-9dfc-8eSAM-
                            PLEPre-Fix/i-02573cafcfEXAMPLE/awsrunShellScript

                            doc-example-bucket is the name of the S3 bucket;

                            ab19cb99-a030-46dd-9dfc-8eSAMPLEPre-Fix   is   the
                            name of the S3 prefix;

                            i-02573cafcfEXAMPLE is the managed node ID;

                            awsrunShellScript is the name of the plugin.

                     OutputS3KeyPrefix -> (string)
                        The S3 directory path  inside  the  bucket  where  the
                        responses  to the command executions should be stored.
                        This was requested when issuing the command. For exam-
                        ple, in the following response:
                            doc-example-bucket/ab19cb99-a030-46dd-9dfc-8eSAM-
                            PLEPre-Fix/i-02573cafcfEXAMPLE/awsrunShellScript

                            doc-example-bucket is the name of the S3 bucket;

                            ab19cb99-a030-46dd-9dfc-8eSAMPLEPre-Fix   is   the
                            name of the S3 prefix;

                            i-02573cafcfEXAMPLE is the managed node ID;

                            awsrunShellScript is the name of the plugin.

              ServiceRole -> (string)
                 The  Identity  and  Access Management (IAM) service role that
                 Run Command, a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Man-
                 ager,  uses  to act on your behalf when sending notifications
                 about command status changes on a per managed node basis.

              NotificationConfig -> (structure)
                 Configurations for sending notifications about command status
                 changes on a per managed node basis.

                 NotificationArn -> (string)
                     An  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for an Amazon Simple Noti-
                     fication Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Run  Command  pushes
                     notifications about command status changes to this topic.

                 NotificationEvents -> (list)
                     The different events for which you can receive  notifica-
                     tions.  To  learn more about these events, see Monitoring
                     Systems Manager status changes using Amazon SNS notifica-
                     tions  in  the  Amazon  Web Services Systems Manager User
                     Guide .

              CloudWatchOutputConfig -> (structure)
                 Amazon  CloudWatch Logs information where you want Amazon Web
                 Services Systems Manager to send the command output.

                 CloudWatchLogGroupName -> (string)
                     The name of the CloudWatch Logs log group where you  want
                     to  send  command  output.  If  you don't specify a group
                     name, Amazon Web Services Systems  Manager  automatically
                     creates  a log group for you. The log group uses the fol-
                     lowing naming format:

                        ``
                        aws/ssm/SystemsManagerDocumentName ``

                 CloudWatchOutputEnabled -> (boolean)
