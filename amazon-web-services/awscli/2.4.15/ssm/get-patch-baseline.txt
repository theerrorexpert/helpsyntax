NAME
       get-patch-baseline -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information about a patch baseline.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-patch-baseline
          --baseline-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --baseline-id (string)
          The ID of the patch baseline to retrieve.

          NOTE:
              To  retrieve  information  about  an Amazon Web Services managed
              patch baseline, specify the full Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of
              the  baseline.  For example, for the baseline AWS-AmazonLinuxDe-
              faultPatchBaseline                   ,                   specify
              arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:733109147000:patchbase-
              line/pb-0e392de35e7c563b7 instead of pb-0e392de35e7c563b7 .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       BaselineId -> (string)
          The ID of the retrieved patch baseline.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the patch baseline.

       OperatingSystem -> (string)
          Returns the operating system specified for the patch baseline.

       GlobalFilters -> (structure)
          A set of global filters used to exclude patches from the baseline.

          PatchFilters -> (list)
              The set of patch filters that make up the group.

              (structure)
                 Defines which patches should be included in a patch baseline.

                 A  patch  filter  consists  of a key and a set of values. The
                 filter key is a patch property. For  example,  the  available
                 filter  keys  for  WINDOWS  are  PATCH_SET  , PRODUCT , PROD-
                 UCT_FAMILY , CLASSIFICATION , and MSRC_SEVERITY .

                 The filter values define a matching criterion for  the  patch
                 property indicated by the key. For example, if the filter key
                 is PRODUCT and the filter values are ["Office 2013",  "Office
                 2016"]  ,  then  the filter accepts all patches where product
                 name is either "Office 2013" or  "Office  2016".  The  filter
                 values  can be exact values for the patch property given as a
                 key, or a wildcard (*), which matches all values.

                 You can view lists of valid values for the  patch  properties
                 by  running the DescribePatchProperties command. For informa-
                 tion about which patch properties can be used with each major
                 operating system, see  DescribePatchProperties .

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key for the filter.

                     Run the  DescribePatchProperties command to view lists of
                     valid keys for each operating system type.

                 Values -> (list)
                     The value for the filter key.

                     Run the  DescribePatchProperties command to view lists of
                     valid values for each key based on operating system type.

                     (string)

       ApprovalRules -> (structure)
          A set of rules used to include patches in the baseline.

          PatchRules -> (list)
              The rules that make up the rule group.

              (structure)
                 Defines an approval rule for a patch baseline.

                 PatchFilterGroup -> (structure)
                     The patch filter group that defines the criteria for  the
                     rule.

                     PatchFilters -> (list)
                        The set of patch filters that make up the group.

                        (structure)
                            Defines  which  patches  should  be  included in a
                            patch baseline.

                            A patch filter consists of a key and a set of val-
                            ues. The filter key is a patch property. For exam-
                            ple, the available filter  keys  for  WINDOWS  are
                            PATCH_SET , PRODUCT , PRODUCT_FAMILY , CLASSIFICA-
                            TION , and MSRC_SEVERITY .

                            The filter values define a matching criterion  for
                            the patch property indicated by the key. For exam-
                            ple, if the filter key is PRODUCT and  the  filter
                            values  are  ["Office 2013", "Office 2016"] , then
                            the filter accepts all patches where product  name
                            is either "Office 2013" or "Office 2016". The fil-
                            ter values can be exact values for the patch prop-
                            erty  given  as  a  key,  or a wildcard (*), which
                            matches all values.

                            You can view lists of valid values for  the  patch
                            properties  by running the DescribePatchProperties
                            command. For information about which patch proper-
                            ties can be used with each major operating system,
                            see  DescribePatchProperties .

                            Key -> (string)
                               The key for the filter.

                               Run  the   DescribePatchProperties  command  to
                               view  lists  of  valid  keys for each operating
                               system type.

                            Values -> (list)
                               The value for the filter key.

                               Run  the   DescribePatchProperties  command  to
                               view  lists  of valid values for each key based
                               on operating system type.

                               (string)

                 ComplianceLevel -> (string)
                     A compliance severity level for all approved patches in a
                     patch baseline.

                 ApproveAfterDays -> (integer)
                     The  number  of days after the release date of each patch
                     matched by the rule that the patch is marked as  approved
                     in  the  patch  baseline. For example, a value of 7 means
                     that patches are  approved  seven  days  after  they  are
                     released.  Not  supported  on  Debian  Server  or  Ubuntu
                     Server.

                 ApproveUntilDate -> (string)
                     The cutoff date for auto approval  of  released  patches.
                     Any patches released on or before this date are installed
                     automatically. Not supported on Debian Server  or  Ubuntu
                     Server.

                     Enter  dates  in  the  format  YYYY-MM-DD  . For example,
                     2021-12-31 .

                 EnableNonSecurity -> (boolean)
                     For managed nodes identified by the  approval  rule  fil-
                     ters,  enables  a  patch  baseline  to apply non-security
                     updates  available  in  the  specified  repository.   The
                     default  value  is false . Applies to Linux managed nodes
