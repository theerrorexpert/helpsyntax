NAME
       describe-instance-patch-states-for-patch-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the high-level patch state for the managed nodes in the spec-
       ified patch group.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-instance-patch-states-for-patch-group is  a  paginated  opera-
       tion.  Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire
       data set of results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by  providing  the
       --no-paginate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argu-
       ment on a paginated response, the --query argument  must  extract  data
       from  the  results  of  the following query expressions: InstancePatch-
       States

SYNOPSIS
            describe-instance-patch-states-for-patch-group
          --patch-group <value>
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --patch-group (string)
          The name of the patch group for which the  patch  state  information
          should be retrieved.

       --filters (list)
          Each entry in the array is a structure containing:

          o Key (string between 1 and 200 characters)

          o Values (array containing a single string)

          o Type (string "Equal", "NotEqual", "LessThan", "GreaterThan")

          (structure)
              Defines  a  filter used in  DescribeInstancePatchStatesForPatch-
              Group to scope down the information returned by the API.
                 Example : To filter for all managed nodes in  a  patch  group
                 having more than three patches with a FailedCount status, use
                 the following for the filter:

              o Value for Key : FailedCount

              o Value for Type : GreaterThan

              o Value for Values : 3

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for the filter. Supported values include the  follow-
                 ing:

                 o InstalledCount

                 o InstalledOtherCount

                 o InstalledPendingRebootCount

                 o InstalledRejectedCount

                 o MissingCount

                 o FailedCount

                 o UnreportedNotApplicableCount

                 o NotApplicableCount

              Values -> (list)
                 The  value for the filter. Must be an integer greater than or
                 equal to 0.

                 (string)

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of comparison  that  should  be  performed  for  the
                 value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string,Type=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...],
              "Type": "Equal"|"NotEqual"|"LessThan"|"GreaterThan"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       InstancePatchStates -> (list)
          The high-level patch state for the requested managed nodes.

          (structure)
              Defines the high-level patch  compliance  state  for  a  managed
              node, providing information about the number of installed, miss-
              ing, not applicable, and  failed  patches  along  with  metadata
              about  the  operation when this information was gathered for the
              managed node.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the managed node the  high-level  patch  compliance
                 information was collected for.

              PatchGroup -> (string)
                 The name of the patch group the managed node belongs to.

              BaselineId -> (string)
                 The  ID of the patch baseline used to patch the managed node.

              SnapshotId -> (string)
                 The ID of the patch baseline snapshot used during the  patch-
                 ing operation when this compliance data was collected.

              InstallOverrideList -> (string)
                 An  https URL or an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
                 path-style URL to a list of patches  to  be  installed.  This
                 patch  installation  list, which you maintain in an S3 bucket
                 in YAML format and specify in the SSM document  AWS-RunPatch-
                 Baseline  ,  overrides  the  patches specified by the default
                 patch baseline.

                 For more information about the InstallOverrideList parameter,
                 see         About         the         ``AWS-RunPatchBaseline`

                 Guide .

              OwnerInformation -> (string)
                 Placeholder information. This field will always be  empty  in
                 the current release of the service.

              InstalledCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  patches  from  the  patch  baseline that are
                 installed on the managed node.

              InstalledOtherCount -> (integer)
                 The number of patches not specified  in  the  patch  baseline
                 that are installed on the managed node.

              InstalledPendingRebootCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  patches installed by Patch Manager since the
                 last time the managed node was rebooted.

              InstalledRejectedCount -> (integer)
                 The number of patches installed on a managed  node  that  are
                 specified in a RejectedPatches list. Patches with a status of
                 InstalledRejected were typically installed before  they  were
                 added to a RejectedPatches list.

                 NOTE:
                     If   ALLOW_AS_DEPENDENCY  is  the  specified  option  for
                     RejectedPatchesAction , the value  of  InstalledRejected-
                     Count will always be 0 (zero).

              MissingCount -> (integer)
                 The number of patches from the patch baseline that are appli-
                 cable for the managed node but aren't currently installed.

              FailedCount -> (integer)
                 The number of patches  from  the  patch  baseline  that  were
                 attempted to be installed during the last patching operation,
                 but failed to install.

              UnreportedNotApplicableCount -> (integer)
                 The number of patches beyond the supported limit of NotAppli-
                 cableCount  that aren't reported by name to Inventory. Inven-
                 tory is a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems  Manager.

              NotApplicableCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  patches  from the patch baseline that aren't
                 applicable  for  the  managed  node  and   therefore   aren't
                 installed  on  the  node. This number may be truncated if the
                 list of patch names is very  large.  The  number  of  patches
                 beyond  this  limit  are reported in UnreportedNotApplicable-
                 Count .

              OperationStartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time the most recent patching operation  was  started  on
                 the managed node.

              OperationEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time the most recent patching operation completed on the
                 managed node.

              Operation -> (string)
                 The type of patching operation that was performed: or

                 o SCAN assesses the patch compliance state.

                 o INSTALL installs missing patches.

              LastNoRebootInstallOperationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time of the last attempt to patch the managed  node  with
                 NoReboot specified as the reboot option.

              RebootOption -> (string)
                 Indicates  the reboot option specified in the patch baseline.

                 NOTE:
                     Reboot options apply to Install operations only.  Reboots
                     aren't attempted for Patch Manager Scan operations.

                 o RebootIfNeeded  : Patch Manager tries to reboot the managed
                   node if it installed any patches, or  if  any  patches  are
                   detected with a status of InstalledPendingReboot .

                 o NoReboot  : Patch Manager attempts to install missing pack-
                   ages without trying to reboot the system. Patches installed
                   with  this option are assigned a status of InstalledPendin-
                   gReboot . These patches might not  be  in  effect  until  a
                   reboot is performed.

              CriticalNonCompliantCount -> (integer)
                 The  number of managed nodes where patches that are specified
                 as Critical for compliance reporting in  the  patch  baseline
                 aren't installed. These patches might be missing, have failed
                 installation, were rejected, or were installed but awaiting a
                 required  managed  node  reboot.  The status of these managed
                 nodes is NON_COMPLIANT .

              SecurityNonCompliantCount -> (integer)
                 The number of managed nodes where patches that are  specified
                 as  Security  in  a  patch  advisory  aren't installed. These
                 patches might be  missing,  have  failed  installation,  were
                 rejected,  or  were installed but awaiting a required managed
                 node reboot. The status of these managed nodes is NON_COMPLI-
                 ANT .

              OtherNonCompliantCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of managed nodes with patches installed that are
                 specified as other than Critical or Security but aren't  com-
                 pliant  with  the patch baseline. The status of these managed
                 nodes is NON_COMPLIANT .

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use when requesting the next set of items. If there are
          no additional items to return, the string is empty.
