          [--filters <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The managed node ID for which you want inventory information.

       --type-name (string)
          The type of inventory item for which you want information.

       --filters (list)
          One  or more filters. Use a filter to return a more specific list of
          results.

          (structure)
              One or more filters. Use a filter to return a more specific list
              of results.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter key.

              Values -> (list)
                 Inventory filter values. Example: inventory filter where man-
                 aged node IDs are specified as values  Key=AWS:InstanceInfor-
                 mation.InstanceId,Values=                     i-a12b3c4d5e6g,
                 i-1a2b3c4d5e6,Type=Equal .

                 (string)

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of filter.

                 NOTE:
                     The Exists filter must be used with aggregators. For more
                     information, see Aggregating inventory data in the Amazon
                     Web Services Systems Manager User Guide .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string,Type=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...],
              "Type": "Equal"|"NotEqual"|"BeginWith"|"LessThan"|"GreaterThan"|"Exists"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next set of items to return.  (You  received  this
          token from a previous call.)

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number of items to return for this call. The call also
          returns a token that you can specify in a subsequent call to get the
          next set of results.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To view specific inventory type entries for an instance

       This  following  list-inventory-entries  example  lists  the  inventory
       entries for the AWS:Application inventory type on a specific  instance.

          aws ssm list-inventory-entries \
              --instance-id "i-1234567890abcdef0" \
              --type-name "AWS:Application"

       Output:

          {
            "TypeName": "AWS:Application",
            "InstanceId": "i-1234567890abcdef0",
            "SchemaVersion": "1.1",
            "CaptureTime": "2019-02-15T12:17:55Z",
            "Entries": [
              {
                "Architecture": "i386",
                "Name": "Amazon SSM Agent",
                "PackageId": "{88a60be2-89a1-4df8-812a-80863c2a2b68}",

              },
              {
                "Architecture": "x86_64",
                "InstalledTime": "2018-05-03T13:42:34Z",
                "Name": "AmazonCloudWatchAgent",
                "Publisher": "",
                "Version": "1.200442.0"
              }
            ]
          }

       Example 2: To view custom inventory entries assigned to an instance

       The  following  list-inventory-entries example lists a custom inventory
       entry assigned to an instance.

          aws ssm list-inventory-entries \
              --instance-id "i-1234567890abcdef0" \
              --type-name "Custom:RackInfo"

       Output:

          {
            "TypeName": "Custom:RackInfo",
            "InstanceId": "i-1234567890abcdef0",
            "SchemaVersion": "1.0",
            "CaptureTime": "2021-05-22T10:01:01Z",
            "Entries": [
              {
                "RackLocation": "Bay B/Row C/Rack D/Shelf E"
              }
            ]
          }

OUTPUT
       TypeName -> (string)
          The type of inventory item returned by the request.

       InstanceId -> (string)
          The managed node ID targeted  by  the  request  to  query  inventory
          information.

       SchemaVersion -> (string)
          The inventory schema version used by the managed node(s).

       CaptureTime -> (string)
          The  time  that  inventory information was collected for the managed
          node(s).

       Entries -> (list)
          A list of inventory items on the managed node(s).

          (map)

              value -> (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
