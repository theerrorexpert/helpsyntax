NAME
       update-maintenance-window-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  a task assigned to a maintenance window. You can't change the
       task type, but you can change the following values:

       o TaskARN . For  example,  you  can  change  a  RUN_COMMAND  task  from
         AWS-RunPowerShellScript to AWS-RunShellScript .

       o ServiceRoleArn

       o TaskInvocationParameters

       o Priority

       o MaxConcurrency

       o MaxErrors

       NOTE:
          One  or  more  targets  must be specified for maintenance window Run
          Command-type tasks. Depending on the task, targets are optional  for
          other  maintenance  window  task types (Automation, Lambda, and Step
          Functions). For more information  about  running  tasks  that  don't
          specify  targets,  see  Registering maintenance window tasks without
          targets in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide .

       If the value for a parameter in  UpdateMaintenanceWindowTask  is  null,
       then  the  corresponding  field  isn't  modified. If you set Replace to
       true, then all fields required by the   RegisterTaskWithMaintenanceWin-
       dow  operation  are  required  for  this  request. Optional fields that
       aren't specified are set to null.

       WARNING:
          When you update a maintenance window task that has options specified
          in TaskInvocationParameters , you must provide again all the TaskIn-
          vocationParameters values that you want to retain.  The  values  you
          don't  specify again are removed. For example, suppose that when you
          registered a Run Command task, you  specified  TaskInvocationParame-
          ters  values  for Comment , NotificationConfig , and OutputS3Bucket-
          Name . If you update the maintenance window task and specify only  a
          different OutputS3BucketName value, the values for Comment and Noti-
          ficationConfig are removed.

OPTIONS
       --window-id (string)
          The maintenance window ID that contains the task to modify.

       --window-task-id (string)
          The task ID to modify.

       --targets (list)
          The targets (either managed nodes or tags) to modify. Managed  nodes
          are   specified   using  the  format  Key=instanceids,Values=instan-
          ceID_1,instanceID_2  .  Tags  are   specified   using   the   format
          Key=tag_name,Values=tag_value .

          NOTE:
              One or more targets must be specified for maintenance window Run
              Command-type tasks. Depending on the task, targets are  optional
              for other maintenance window task types (Automation, Lambda, and
              Step Functions). For more information about running  tasks  that
              don't  specify targets, see Registering maintenance window tasks
              without targets in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager  User
              Guide .

          (structure)
              An  array  of search criteria that targets managed nodes using a
              key-value pair that you specify.

              NOTE:
                 One or more targets must be specified for maintenance  window
                 Run  Command-type  tasks.  Depending on the task, targets are
                 optional for other maintenance window task types (Automation,
                 Lambda,  and Step Functions). For more information about run-
                 ning tasks that don't specify targets, see Registering  main-
                 tenance  window  tasks without targets in the Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices Systems Manager User Guide .

              Supported formats include the following.

              o Key=InstanceIds,Val-
                ues=<instance-id-1>,<instance-id-2>,<instance-id-3>

              o Key=tag:<my-tag-key>,Values=<my-tag-value-1>,<my-tag-value-2>

              o Key=tag-key,Values=<my-tag-key-1>,<my-tag-key-2>

              o Run   Command   and   Maintenance   window   targets   only  :
                Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=<resource-group-name>

              o Maintenance        window        targets        only         :
                Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Val-
                ues=<resource-type-1>,<resource-type-2>

              o Automation    targets    only     :     Key=ResourceGroup;Val-
                ues=<resource-group-name>

              For example:

              o Key=InstanceIds,Values=i-02573cafcfEXAMPLE,i-0471e04240EXAM-
                PLE,i-07782c72faEXAMPLE

              o Key=tag:CostCenter,Values=CostCenter1,CostCenter2,CostCenter3

              o Key=tag-key,Values=Name,Instance-Type,CostCenter

              o Run  Command   and   Maintenance   window   targets   only   :
                Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=ProductionResourceGroup   This
                example demonstrates  how  to  target  all  resources  in  the
                resource  group  ProductionResourceGroup  in  your maintenance
                window.

              o Maintenance        window        targets        only         :
                Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Val-
                ues=AWS::EC2::INSTANCE,AWS::EC2::VPC    This  example   demon-
                strates  how to target only Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Ama-
                zon EC2) instances and VPCs in your maintenance window.

              o Automation targets only : Key=ResourceGroup,Values=MyResource-
                Group

              o State  Manager association targets only : Key=InstanceIds,Val-
                ues=*   This example demonstrates how to  target  all  managed
                instances in the Amazon Web Services Region where the associa-
                tion was created.

              For more information about how to send commands that target man-
              aged  nodes  using  Key,Value parameters, see Targeting multiple
              instances in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User  Guide
              .

              Key -> (string)
                 User-defined  criteria  for sending commands that target man-
                 aged nodes that meet the criteria.

              Values -> (list)
                 User-defined criteria that maps to Key . For example, if  you
                 specified  tag:ServerRole , you could specify value:WebServer
                 to run a command  on  instances  that  include  EC2  tags  of
                 ServerRole,WebServer .

                 Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of values
                 for a key might be lower than the global maximum of 50.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]

       --task-arn (string)
          The task ARN to modify.

       --service-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM service  role  for  Amazon
          Web  Services  Systems  Manager to assume when running a maintenance
          window task. If you do not specify a service role ARN, Systems  Man-
          ager  uses  your account's service-linked role. If no service-linked
          role for Systems Manager exists in your account, it is created  when
          you run RegisterTaskWithMaintenanceWindow .

          For  more information, see the following topics in the in the Amazon
          Web Services Systems Manager User Guide :

          o Using service-linked roles for Systems Manager

          o Should I use a service-linked role or a custom service role to run
            maintenance window tasks?

       --task-parameters (map)
          The parameters to modify.

          NOTE:
              TaskParameters  has  been  deprecated.  To specify parameters to
              pass to a task when it runs, instead use the  Parameters  option
              in the TaskInvocationParameters structure. For information about
              how Systems Manager handles  these  options  for  the  supported
              maintenance window task types, see  MaintenanceWindowTaskInvoca-
              tionParameters .

          The map has the following format:

          Key: string, between 1 and 255 characters

          Value: an array of strings, each string is between 1 and 255 charac-
          ters

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Defines the values for a task parameter.

              Values -> (list)
                 This  field contains an array of 0 or more strings, each 1 to
                 255 characters in length.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=Values=string,string,KeyName2=Values=string,string

                "Values": ["string", ...]
              }
            ...}

       --task-invocation-parameters (structure)
          The parameters that the task should use during  execution.  Populate
          only the fields that match the task type. All other fields should be
          empty.

          WARNING:
              When you update a maintenance window task that has options spec-
              ified  in  TaskInvocationParameters , you must provide again all
              the TaskInvocationParameters values that you want to retain. The
              values you don't specify again are removed. For example, suppose
              that when you registered a Run Command task, you specified Task-
              InvocationParameters  values  for Comment , NotificationConfig ,
              and OutputS3BucketName . If you update  the  maintenance  window
              task  and specify only a different OutputS3BucketName value, the
              values for Comment and NotificationConfig are removed.

          RunCommand -> (structure)
              The parameters for a RUN_COMMAND task type.

              Comment -> (string)

                     The  name of the CloudWatch Logs log group where you want
                     to send command output. If  you  don't  specify  a  group
                     name,  Amazon  Web Services Systems Manager automatically
                     creates a log group for you. The log group uses the  fol-
                     lowing naming format:

                        ``
                        aws/ssm/SystemsManagerDocumentName ``

                 CloudWatchOutputEnabled -> (boolean)
                     Enables  Systems Manager to send command output to Cloud-
                     Watch Logs.

              DocumentHash -> (string)
                 The SHA-256 or SHA-1 hash created by the system when the doc-
                 ument was created. SHA-1 hashes have been deprecated.

              DocumentHashType -> (string)
                 SHA-256 or SHA-1. SHA-1 hashes have been deprecated.

              DocumentVersion -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web Services Systems Manager document (SSM docu-
                 ment) version to use in the request. You can specify $DEFAULT
                 , $LATEST , or a specific version number. If you run commands
                 by using the Amazon Web Services CLI, then  you  must  escape
                 the  first two options by using a backslash. If you specify a
                 version number, then you don't need to use the backslash. For
                 example:
                     --document-version "\$DEFAULT"

                     --document-version "\$LATEST"

                     --document-version "3"

              NotificationConfig -> (structure)

                     The  different events for which you can receive notifica-
                     tions. To learn more about these events,  see  Monitoring
                     Systems Manager status changes using Amazon SNS notifica-
                     tions in the Amazon Web  Services  Systems  Manager  User
                     Guide .

                        nanceWindowTaskInvocationParameters .

                        TaskParameters has been deprecated. To specify parame-
                        ters to pass to a task when it runs, instead  use  the
                        Parameters   option  in  the  TaskInvocationParameters
                        structure. For information about how  Systems  Manager

                        window task types,  see   MaintenanceWindowTaskInvoca-
                        tionParameters .

                     For  AUTOMATION  task  types, Amazon Web Services Systems
                     Manager ignores any values specified  for  these  parame-
                     ters.

                 key -> (string)

                 The name of the STEP_FUNCTIONS task.

          Lambda -> (structure)
              The parameters for a LAMBDA task type.

              ClientContext -> (string)
                 Pass  client-specific information to the Lambda function that
                 you are invoking. You can then process the client information
                 in  your  Lambda  function  as you choose through the context
                 variable.

              Qualifier -> (string)
                 (Optional) Specify an Lambda function version or alias  name.
                 If  you  specify  a  function version, the operation uses the
                 qualified function Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  to  invoke  a
                 specific  Lambda  function. If you specify an alias name, the
                 operation uses the alias ARN to invoke  the  Lambda  function
                 version to which the alias points.

              Payload -> (blob)
                 JSON to provide to your Lambda function as input.

       --priority (integer)
          The  new  task priority to specify. The lower the number, the higher
          the priority. Tasks that have the same  priority  are  scheduled  in
          parallel.

       --max-concurrency (string)
          The  new MaxConcurrency value you want to specify. MaxConcurrency is
          the number of targets that are allowed to run this task in parallel.

          NOTE:
              For  maintenance  window  tasks  without a target specified, you
              can't supply a  value  for  this  option.  Instead,  the  system
              inserts  a placeholder value of 1 , which may be reported in the
              response to this command. This value doesn't affect the  running
              of your task and can be ignored.

       --max-errors (string)
          The  new MaxErrors value to specify. MaxErrors is the maximum number
          of errors that are allowed before the task stops being scheduled.

          NOTE:
              For maintenance window tasks without  a  target  specified,  you
              can't  supply  a  value  for  this  option.  Instead, the system
              inserts a placeholder value of 1 , which may be reported in  the
              response  to this command. This value doesn't affect the running
              of your task and can be ignored.

       --logging-info (structure)
          The new logging location in Amazon S3 to specify.

          NOTE:
              LoggingInfo has been deprecated. To  specify  an  Amazon  Simple
              Storage  Service (Amazon S3) bucket to contain logs, instead use
              the OutputS3BucketName  and  OutputS3KeyPrefix  options  in  the
              TaskInvocationParameters  structure.  For  information about how
              Amazon Web Services Systems Manager handles  these  options  for
              the  supported  maintenance  window  task  types,  see   Mainte-
              nanceWindowTaskInvocationParameters .

          S3BucketName -> (string)
              The name of an S3 bucket where execution logs are stored .

          S3KeyPrefix -> (string)
              (Optional) The S3 bucket subfolder.

          S3Region -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services Region where the S3 bucket is located.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3BucketName=string,S3KeyPrefix=string,S3Region=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3BucketName": "string",
            "S3KeyPrefix": "string",
            "S3Region": "string"
          }

       --name (string)
          The new task name to specify.

       --description (string)
          The new task description to specify.

       --replace | --no-replace (boolean)
          If True, then all fields that are required by the  RegisterTaskWith-
          MaintenanceWindow  operation are also required for this API request.
          Optional fields that aren't specified are set to null.

       --cutoff-behavior (string)
          Indicates whether tasks should continue to run after the cutoff time
          specified in the maintenance windows is reached.

          o CONTINUE_TASK  :  When  the cutoff time is reached, any tasks that
            are running continue. The default value.

          o CANCEL_TASK :

            o For Automation, Lambda, Step Functions tasks:  When  the  cutoff
              time  is  reached, any task invocations that are already running
              continue, but no new task invocations are started.

            o For Run Command tasks: When the cutoff time is reached, the sys-
              tem sends a  CancelCommand operation that attempts to cancel the
              command associated with the task. However, there is no guarantee
              that  the  command will be terminated and the underlying process
              stopped.

          The status for tasks that are not completed is TIMED_OUT .

          Possible values:

          o CONTINUE_TASK

          o CANCEL_TASK

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       WindowId -> (string)
          The ID of the maintenance window that was updated.

       WindowTaskId -> (string)
          The task ID of the maintenance window that was updated.

       Targets -> (list)

                 One  or more targets must be specified for maintenance window
                 Run Command-type tasks. Depending on the  task,  targets  are
                 optional for other maintenance window task types (Automation,
                 Lambda, and Step Functions). For more information about  run-
                 ning  tasks that don't specify targets, see Registering main-
                 tenance window tasks without targets in the Amazon  Web  Ser-
                 vices Systems Manager User Guide .

                Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=ProductionResourceGroup   This
                example  demonstrates  how  to  target  all  resources  in the
                resource group  ProductionResourceGroup  in  your  maintenance
                window.

              o Maintenance         window        targets        only        :
                Key=resource-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Val-
                ues=AWS::EC2::INSTANCE,AWS::EC2::VPC     This  example  demon-
                strates how to target only Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud  (Ama-
                zon EC2) instances and VPCs in your maintenance window.

              o Automation targets only : Key=ResourceGroup,Values=MyResource-
                Group

              o State Manager association targets only :  Key=InstanceIds,Val-
                ues=*    This  example  demonstrates how to target all managed
                instances in the Amazon Web Services Region where the associa-
                tion was created.

              For more information about how to send commands that target man-
              aged nodes using Key,Value parameters,  see  Targeting  multiple

              .

              Key -> (string)
                 User-defined criteria for sending commands that  target  man-
                 aged nodes that meet the criteria.

              Values -> (list)
                 User-defined  criteria that maps to Key . For example, if you
                 specified tag:ServerRole , you could specify  value:WebServer
                 to  run  a  command  on  instances  that  include EC2 tags of
                 ServerRole,WebServer .

                 Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of values
                 for a key might be lower than the global maximum of 50.

                 (string)

          tasks.

       TaskParameters -> (map)
          The updated parameter values.

          NOTE:
              TaskParameters has been deprecated.  To  specify  parameters  to
              pass  to  a task when it runs, instead use the Parameters option
              in the TaskInvocationParameters structure. For information about
              how  Systems  Manager  handles  these  options for the supported
              maintenance window task types, see  MaintenanceWindowTaskInvoca-
              tionParameters .

          key -> (string)

                     The  name of the CloudWatch Logs log group where you want
                     to send command output. If  you  don't  specify  a  group
                     name,  Amazon  Web Services Systems Manager automatically
                     creates a log group for you. The log group uses the  fol-
                     lowing naming format:

                        ``

                 The  Amazon  Web Services Systems Manager document (SSM docu-
                 ment) version to use in the request. You can specify $DEFAULT
                 , $LATEST , or a specific version number. If you run commands
                 by using the Amazon Web Services CLI, then  you  must  escape
                 the  first two options by using a backslash. If you specify a
                 version number, then you don't need to use the backslash. For
                 example:

                 value -> (list)
                     (string)

          StepFunctions -> (structure)
              The parameters for a STEP_FUNCTIONS task type.

              Input -> (string)
                 The inputs for the STEP_FUNCTIONS task.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the STEP_FUNCTIONS task.

          Lambda -> (structure)

              ClientContext -> (string)
                 Pass  client-specific information to the Lambda function that
                 you are invoking. You can then process the client information
                 in  your  Lambda  function  as you choose through the context
                 variable.

              Qualifier -> (string)
                 (Optional) Specify an Lambda function version or alias  name.
                 If  you  specify  a  function version, the operation uses the
                 qualified function Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  to  invoke  a
                 specific  Lambda  function. If you specify an alias name, the
                 operation uses the alias ARN to invoke  the  Lambda  function
                 version to which the alias points.

              Payload -> (blob)
                 JSON to provide to your Lambda function as input.

       Priority -> (integer)
