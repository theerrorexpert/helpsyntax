LIST-COMPLIANCE-ITEMS()                                LIST-COMPLIANCE-ITEMS()



NAME
       list-compliance-items -

DESCRIPTION
       For  a specified resource ID, this API operation returns a list of com-
       pliance statuses for different resource types. Currently, you can  only
       specify  one  resource ID per call. List results depend on the criteria
       specified in the filter.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-compliance-items is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: ComplianceItems

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          One  or  more compliance filters. Use a filter to return a more spe-
          cific list of results.

          (structure)
              One or more filters. Use a filter to return a more specific list
              of results.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 The value for which to search.

                 (string)

              Type -> (string)
                 The  type  of  comparison  that  should  be performed for the
                 value: Equal, NotEqual, BeginWith, LessThan, or  GreaterThan.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string,Type=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...],
              "Type": "EQUAL"|"NOT_EQUAL"|"BEGIN_WITH"|"LESS_THAN"|"GREATER_THAN"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --resource-ids (list)
          The  ID  for the resources from which to get compliance information.
          Currently, you can only specify one resource ID.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --resource-types (list)
          The type of resource from which to get compliance information.  Cur-
          rently, the only supported resource type is ManagedInstance .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ComplianceItems -> (list)
          A list of compliance information for the specified resource ID.

          (structure)
              Information about the compliance  as  defined  by  the  resource
              type.  For  example,  for  a patch resource type, Items includes
              information about the PatchSeverity, Classification, and so  on.

              ComplianceType -> (string)
                 The  compliance  type.  For example, Association (for a State
                 Manager association), Patch, or Custom:string are  all  valid
                 compliance types.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The  type  of resource. ManagedInstance is currently the only
                 supported resource type.

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 An ID for the resource. For a managed node, this is the  node
                 ID.

              Id -> (string)
                 An ID for the compliance item. For example, if the compliance
                 item is a Windows patch, the ID could be the number of the KB
                 article; for example: KB4010320.

              Title -> (string)
                 A  title for the compliance item. For example, if the compli-
                 ance item is a Windows patch, the title could be the title of
                 the  KB  article  for the patch; for example: Security Update
                 for Active Directory Federation Services.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the compliance item. An item is either  COMPLI-
                 ANT,  NON_COMPLIANT,  or an empty string (for Windows patches
                 that aren't applicable).

              Severity -> (string)
                 The severity of the compliance status. Severity can be one of
                 the  following:  Critical,  High, Medium, Low, Informational,
                 Unspecified.

              ExecutionSummary -> (structure)
                 A summary for the compliance item. The  summary  includes  an
                 execution  ID, the execution type (for example, command), and
                 the execution time.

                 ExecutionTime -> (timestamp)
                     The time the execution ran as a datetime object  that  is
                     saved  in the following format: yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'.

                 ExecutionId -> (string)
                     An ID created by the system when  PutComplianceItems  was
                     called.  For  example, CommandID is a valid execution ID.
                     You can use this ID in subsequent calls.

                 ExecutionType -> (string)
                     The type of execution. For example, Command  is  a  valid
                     execution type.

              Details -> (map)
                 A "Key": "Value" tag combination for the compliance item.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of items to return. Use this token to get
          the next set of results.
