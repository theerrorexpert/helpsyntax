NAME
       describe-ops-items -

DESCRIPTION
       Query  a  set  of  OpsItems.  You  must have permission in Identity and
       Access Management (IAM) to query a list of OpsItems. For more  informa-
       tion,  see  Getting  started  with OpsCenter in the Amazon Web Services
       Systems Manager User Guide .

       Operations engineers and IT professionals use Amazon Web Services  Sys-
       tems  Manager OpsCenter to view, investigate, and remediate operational
       issues impacting the performance and health of their  Amazon  Web  Ser-
       vices  resources. For more information, see OpsCenter in the Amazon Web
       Services Systems Manager User Guide .

       describe-ops-items is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: OpsItemSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            describe-ops-items
          [--ops-item-filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --ops-item-filters (list)
          One or more filters to limit the response.

          o Key: CreatedTime Operations: GreaterThan, LessThan

          o Key: LastModifiedBy Operations: Contains, Equals

          o Key: LastModifiedTime Operations: GreaterThan, LessThan

          o Key: Priority Operations: Equals

          o Key: Source Operations: Contains, Equals

          o Key: Status Operations: Equals

          o Key: Title* Operations: Equals,Contains

          o Key: OperationalData** Operations: Equals

          o Key: OperationalDataKey Operations: Equals

          o Key: OperationalDataValue Operations: Equals, Contains

          o Key: OpsItemId Operations: Equals

          o Key: ResourceId Operations: Contains

          o Key: AutomationId Operations: Equals


          *
          The  Equals  operator for Title matches the first 100 characters. If
          you specify more than 100 characters, they system returns  an  error
          that the filter value exceeds the length limit.


          **
          If  you  filter  the response by using the OperationalData operator,
          specify a  key-value  pair  by  using  the  following  JSON  format:
          {"key":"key_name","value":"a_value"}

          (structure)
              Describes an OpsItem filter.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter value.

                 (string)

              Operator -> (string)
                 The operator used by the filter call.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string,Operator=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "Status"|"CreatedBy"|"Source"|"Priority"|"Title"|"OpsItemId"|"CreatedTime"|"LastModifiedTime"|"ActualStartTime"|"ActualEndTime"|"PlannedStartTime"|"PlannedEndTime"|"OperationalData"|"OperationalDataKey"|"OperationalDataValue"|"ResourceId"|"AutomationId"|"Category"|"Severity"|"OpsItemType"|"ChangeRequestByRequesterArn"|"ChangeRequestByRequesterName"|"ChangeRequestByApproverArn"|"ChangeRequestByApproverName"|"ChangeRequestByTemplate"|"ChangeRequestByTargetsResourceGroup"|"InsightByType",
              "Values": ["string", ...],
              "Operator": "Equal"|"Contains"|"GreaterThan"|"LessThan"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
