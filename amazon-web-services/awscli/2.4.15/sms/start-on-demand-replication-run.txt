NAME
       start-on-demand-replication-run -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  an on-demand replication run for the specified replication job.
       This replication run starts immediately. This  replication  run  is  in
       addition to the ones already scheduled.

       There  is a limit on the number of on-demand replications runs that you
       can request in a 24-hour period.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-on-demand-replication-run
          --replication-job-id <value>
          [--description <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --replication-job-id (string)
          The ID of the replication job.

       --description (string)
          The description of the replication run.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       replicationRunId -> (string)
          The ID of the replication run.
