SYNOPSIS
            list-call-analytics-jobs
          [--status <value>]
          [--job-name-contains <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --status (string)
          When specified, returns only call analytics jobs with the  specified
          status. Jobs are ordered by creation date, with the most recent jobs
          returned first. If you don't specify  a  status,  Amazon  Transcribe
          returns all analytics jobs ordered by creation date.

          Possible values:

          o QUEUED

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o FAILED

          o COMPLETED

       --job-name-contains (string)
          When  specified,  the  jobs returned in the list are limited to jobs
          whose name contains the specified string.

       --next-token (string)
          If you receive a truncated result  in  the  previous  request  of  ,
          include NextToken to fetch the next set of jobs.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of call analytics jobs to return in each page of
          results. If there are fewer results than the value you specify, only
          the  actual results are returned. If you do not specify a value, the
          default of 5 is used.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Status -> (string)
          When specified, returns only call analytics jobs with  that  status.
          Jobs  are  ordered  by  creation  date,  with  the  most recent jobs
          returned first. If you don't specify  a  status,  Amazon  Transcribe
          returns all transcription jobs ordered by creation date.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  operation returns a page of jobs at a time. The maximum size of
          the page is set by the MaxResults parameter. If there are more  jobs
          in  the  list  than  the  page  size,  Amazon Transcribe returns the
          NextPage token. Include the token in your next request to the opera-
          tion to return next page of jobs.

       CallAnalyticsJobSummaries -> (list)
          A list of objects containing summary information for a transcription
          job.

          (structure)
              Provides summary information about a call analytics job.

              CallAnalyticsJobName -> (string)
                 The name of the call analytics job.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp that shows when the call analytics job  was  cre-
                 ated.

              StartTime -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp that shows when the job began processing.

              CompletionTime -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp that shows when the job was completed.

              LanguageCode -> (string)
                 The language of the transcript in the source audio file.

              CallAnalyticsJobStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the call analytics job.

              FailureReason -> (string)
                 If  the  CallAnalyticsJobStatus  is FAILED , a description of
                 the error.
