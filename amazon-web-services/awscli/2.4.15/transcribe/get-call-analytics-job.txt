GET-CALL-ANALYTICS-JOB()                              GET-CALL-ANALYTICS-JOB()



NAME
       get-call-analytics-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  a call analytics job. To see the status of
       the job, check the CallAnalyticsJobStatus field. If the status is  COM-
       PLETED  , the job is finished and you can find the results at the loca-
       tion specified in the TranscriptFileUri field. If you enable personally
       identifiable  information  (PII)  redaction,  the  redacted  transcript
       appears in the RedactedTranscriptFileUri field.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-call-analytics-job
          --call-analytics-job-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --call-analytics-job-name (string)
          The name of the analytics job you want information about. This value
          is case sensitive.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CallAnalyticsJob -> (structure)
          An object that contains the results of your call analytics job.

          CallAnalyticsJobName -> (string)
              The name of the call analytics job.

          CallAnalyticsJobStatus -> (string)
              The status of the analytics job.

          LanguageCode -> (string)
              If  you  know  the  language spoken between the customer and the
              agent, specify a language code for this field.

              If you don't know the language, you can leave this field  blank,
              and Amazon Transcribe will use machine learning to automatically
              identify the language. To improve the accuracy of language iden-
              tification,  you  can  provide  an array containing the possible
              language codes for the language spoken in your audio.  Refer  to
              Supported languages for additional information.

          MediaSampleRateHertz -> (integer)
              The sample rate, in Hertz, of the audio.

          MediaFormat -> (string)
              The  format  of  the  input audio file. Note: for call analytics
              jobs, only the following media formats are supported: MP3,  MP4,
              WAV, FLAC, OGG, and WebM.

          Media -> (structure)
              Describes the input media file in a transcription request.

              MediaFileUri -> (string)
                 The  S3 object location of the input media file. The URI must
                 be in the same region as the API endpoint that you are  call-
                 ing. The general form is:
                     s3://<AWSDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET>/<keyprefix>/<objectkey>

                 For example:
                     s3://AWSDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/example.mp4

                     s3://AWSDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/mediadocs/example.mp4

                 For  more  information about S3 object names, see Object Keys
                 in the Amazon S3 Developer Guide .

              RedactedMediaFileUri -> (string)
                 The S3 object location for your redacted output  media  file.
                 This is only supported for call analytics jobs.

          Transcript -> (structure)
              Identifies the location of a transcription.

              TranscriptFileUri -> (string)
                 The S3 object location of the transcript.

                 Use this URI to access the transcript. If you specified an S3
                 bucket in the OutputBucketName field  when  you  created  the
                 job,  this  is  the URI of that bucket. If you chose to store
                 the transcript in Amazon Transcribe, this is a shareable  URL
                 that provides secure access to that location.

              RedactedTranscriptFileUri -> (string)
                 The S3 object location of the redacted transcript.

                 Use this URI to access the redacted transcript. If you speci-
                 fied an S3 bucket in the OutputBucketName field when you cre-
                 ated the job, this is the URI of that bucket. If you chose to
                 store the transcript in Amazon Transcribe, this is  a  share-
                 able URL that provides secure access to that location.

          StartTime -> (timestamp)
              A  timestamp  that shows when the analytics job started process-
              ing.

              A timestamp that shows when the analytics job was completed.

          FailureReason -> (string)
              If the AnalyticsJobStatus is FAILED , this field contains infor-
              mation about why the job failed.

              The FailureReason field can contain one of the following values:

              o Unsupported media format : The media format specified  in  the
                MediaFormat field of the request isn't valid. See the descrip-
                tion of the MediaFormat field for a list of valid values.

              o The media format provided does not match  the  detected  media
                format  : The media format of the audio file doesn't match the
                format specified in the  MediaFormat  field  in  the  request.
                Check  the  media  format of your media file and make sure the
                two values match.

              o Invalid sample rate for audio file : The sample rate specified
                in  the  MediaSampleRateHertz  of the request isn't valid. The
                sample rate must be between 8,000 and 48,000 Hertz.

              o The sample rate provided does not match  the  detected  sample
                rate  :  The  sample  rate in the audio file doesn't match the
                sample rate specified in the MediaSampleRateHertz field in the
                request.  Check  the  sample  rate of your media file and make
                sure that the two values match.

              o Invalid file size: file size too large  :  The  size  of  your
                audio  file  is larger than what Amazon Transcribe Medical can
                process. For more information, see Guidelines  and  Quotas  in
                the Amazon Transcribe Medical Guide.

              o Invalid  number  of  channels:  number of channels too large :
                Your audio contains more channels than Amazon Transcribe Medi-
                cal  is configured to process. To request additional channels,
                see Amazon Transcribe Medical  Endpoints  and  Quotas  in  the
                Amazon Web Services General Reference .

          DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) that you use to access the ana-
              lytics   job.   ARNs   have   the   format    arn:partition:ser-
              vice:region:account-id:resource-type/resource-id .

          IdentifiedLanguageScore -> (float)
              A  value between zero and one that Amazon Transcribe assigned to
              the language that it identified in the source audio. This  value
              appears  only  when  you  don't  provide a single language code.
              Larger values indicate that Amazon Transcribe has higher  confi-
              dence in the language that it identified.

          Settings -> (structure)
              Provides information about the settings used to run a transcrip-
              tion job.

              VocabularyName -> (string)
                 The name of a vocabulary to use when processing the call ana-
                 lytics job.

              VocabularyFilterName -> (string)
                 The  name of the vocabulary filter to use when running a call
                 analytics job. The filter that you specify must have the same
                 language code as the analytics job.

              VocabularyFilterMethod -> (string)
                 Set  to  mask to remove filtered text from the transcript and
                 replace it with three asterisks ("
                 **

                 *
                 ") as placeholder text. Set to remove to remove filtered text
                 from  the  transcript  without using placeholder text. Set to
                 tag to mark the word in the transcription output that matches
                 the  vocabulary filter. When you set the filter method to tag
                 , the words matching your vocabulary filter are not masked or
                 removed.

              LanguageModelName -> (string)
                 The structure used to describe a custom language model.

              ContentRedaction -> (structure)

                     Request   parameter  that  defines  the  entities  to  be
                     redacted. The only accepted value is PII .

                 RedactionOutput -> (string)
                     The output transcript file stored in either  the  default
                     S3 bucket or in a bucket you specify.

                     When  you  choose redacted Amazon Transcribe outputs only
                     the redacted transcript.

                     When you choose redacted_and_unredacted Amazon Transcribe
                     outputs both the redacted and unredacted transcripts.

                 PiiEntityTypes -> (list)
                     The  types  of  personally identifiable information (PII)
                     you want to redact in your transcript.

                     (string)

              LanguageOptions -> (list)
                 When you run a call analytics job, you can specify  the  lan-
                 guage  spoken in the audio, or you can have Amazon Transcribe
                 identify the language for you.

                 To specify a language, specify an  array  with  one  language
                 code.  If  you  don't  know  the language, you can leave this
                 field blank and Amazon Transcribe will use  machine  learning
                 to  identify  the language for you. To improve the ability of
                 Amazon Transcribe to correctly identify the language, you can
                 provide  an array of the languages that can be present in the
                 audio. Refer to Supported languages for  additional  informa-
                 tion.

                 (string)

              LanguageIdSettings -> (map)

                     VocabularyName -> (string)
                        The name of the vocabulary you want to use  when  pro-
                        cessing  your  transcription  job.  The vocabulary you
                        specify must have the same language codes as the tran-
                        scription  job;  if  the  languages  don't  match, the
                        vocabulary isn't applied.

                     VocabularyFilterName -> (string)
                        The name of the vocabulary filter you want to use when
