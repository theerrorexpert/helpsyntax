GET-MEDICAL-VOCABULARY()                              GET-MEDICAL-VOCABULARY()



NAME
       get-medical-vocabulary -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information about a medical vocabulary.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-medical-vocabulary
          --vocabulary-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --vocabulary-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  vocabulary  that you want information about. The
          value is case sensitive.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about a medical custom vocabulary

       The following get-medical-vocabulary example gets information on a med-
       ical  custom  vocabulary.  You can use the VocabularyState parameter to
       see the processing state of the vocabulary. If it's READY, you can  use
       it in the StartMedicalTranscriptionJob operation.:

          aws transcribe get-medical-vocabulary \
              --vocabulary-name medical-vocab-example

       Output:

          {
              "VocabularyName": "medical-vocab-example",
              "LanguageCode": "en-US",
              "VocabularyState": "READY",
              "LastModifiedTime": "2020-09-19T23:59:04.349000+00:00",
              "DownloadUri": "https://link-to-download-the-text-file-used-to-create-your-medical-custom-vocabulary"
          }
