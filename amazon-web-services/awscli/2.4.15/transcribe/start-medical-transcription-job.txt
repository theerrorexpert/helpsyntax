OPTIONS
       --medical-transcription-job-name (string)
          The name of the medical transcription job. You can't use the strings
          ". " or ".. " by themselves as the job name. The name must  also  be
          unique within an Amazon Web Services account. If you try to create a
          medical transcription job with the same name as a  previous  medical
          transcription job, you get a ConflictException error.

       --language-code (string)
          The  language  code for the language spoken in the input media file.
          US English (en-US) is the  valid  value  for  medical  transcription
          jobs.  Any  other  value  you  enter  for language code results in a
          BadRequestException error.

       --media-sample-rate-hertz (integer)
          The sample rate, in Hertz, of the audio track  in  the  input  media
          file.

          If you do not specify the media sample rate, Amazon Transcribe Medi-
          cal determines the sample rate. If you specify the sample  rate,  it
          must  match  the rate detected by Amazon Transcribe Medical. In most
          cases, you should leave the MediaSampleRateHertz field blank and let
          Amazon Transcribe Medical determine the sample rate.

       --media-format (string)
          The audio format of the input media file.

          Possible values:

          o mp3

          o mp4

          o wav

          o flac

          o ogg

          o amr

          o webm

       --media (structure)
          Describes the input media file in a transcription request.

          MediaFileUri -> (string)
              The  S3 object location of the input media file. The URI must be
              in the same region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The
              general form is:
                 s3://<AWSDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET>/<keyprefix>/<objectkey>

              For example:
                 s3://AWSDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/example.mp4

                 s3://AWSDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/mediadocs/example.mp4

              For  more  information about S3 object names, see Object Keys in
              the Amazon S3 Developer Guide .

          RedactedMediaFileUri -> (string)
              The S3 object location for your redacted output media file. This
              is only supported for call analytics jobs.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MediaFileUri=string,RedactedMediaFileUri=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MediaFileUri": "string",
            "RedactedMediaFileUri": "string"
          }

       --output-bucket-name (string)
          The Amazon S3 location where the transcription is stored.

          You must set OutputBucketName for Amazon Transcribe Medical to store
          the transcription results. Your transcript appears in the  S3  loca-
          tion  you  specify.  When you call the  GetMedicalTranscriptionJob ,
          the operation returns this location in the TranscriptFileUri  field.
          The  S3  bucket  must  have permissions that allow Amazon Transcribe
          Medical to put files  in  the  bucket.  For  more  information,  see
          Permissions Required for IAM User Roles .

          You  can specify an Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS)
          key to encrypt the output of your transcription using the  OutputEn-
          cryptionKMSKeyId  parameter.  If you don't specify a KMS key, Amazon
          Transcribe Medical uses the default Amazon S3  key  for  server-side
          encryption of transcripts that are placed in your S3 bucket.

       --output-key (string)
          You  can specify a location in an Amazon S3 bucket to store the out-
          put of your medical transcription job.

          If you don't specify an output key, Amazon Transcribe Medical stores
          the  output  of  your  transcription job in the Amazon S3 bucket you
          specified.  By  default,  the   object   key   is   "your-transcrip-
          tion-job-name.json".

          You  can  use  output  keys to specify the Amazon S3 prefix and file
          name of the transcription output. For example, specifying the Amazon
          S3  prefix,  "folder1/folder2/",  as an output key would lead to the
          output    being    stored    as     "folder1/folder2/your-transcrip-
          tion-job-name.json".  If you specify "my-other-job-name.json" as the
          output key, the object key is changed  to  "my-other-job-name.json".
          You  can  use  an  output key to change both the prefix and the file
          name, for example "folder/my-other-job-name.json".

          If you specify an output key, you must also specify an S3 bucket  in
          the OutputBucketName parameter.

       --output-encryption-kms-key-id (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web Services Key Man-
          agement Service (KMS) key used to encrypt the output  of  the  tran-
          scription  job.  The  user calling the  StartMedicalTranscriptionJob
          operation must have permission to use the specified KMS key.

          You use either of the following to identify a KMS key in the current
          account:

          o KMS Key ID: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

          o KMS Key Alias: "alias/ExampleAlias"

          You  can  use  either  of the following to identify a KMS key in the
          current account or another account:

          o Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS key in the current account  or
            another                                                   account:
            "arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

          o ARN of a KMS Key Alias: "arn:aws:kms:region:account ID:alias/Exam-
            pleAlias"

          If you don't specify an encryption key, the output  of  the  medical
          transcription  job  is  encrypted  with  the  default  Amazon S3 key
          (SSE-S3).

          If you specify a KMS key to encrypt your output, you must also spec-
          ify an output location in the OutputBucketName parameter.

       --kms-encryption-context (map)
          A map of plain text, non-secret key:value pairs, known as encryption
          context pairs, that provide an added  layer  of  security  for  your
          data.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --settings (structure)
          Optional settings for the medical transcription job.

          ShowSpeakerLabels -> (boolean)
              Determines  whether  the transcription job uses speaker recogni-
              tion to identify different speakers in the input audio.  Speaker
              recognition labels individual speakers in the audio file. If you
              set the ShowSpeakerLabels field to true, you must also  set  the
              maximum  number of speaker labels in the MaxSpeakerLabels field.

              You can't set both ShowSpeakerLabels  and  ChannelIdentification
              in  the  same  request.  If you set both, your request returns a
              BadRequestException .

          MaxSpeakerLabels -> (integer)
              The maximum number of speakers to identify in the  input  audio.
              If there are more speakers in the audio than this number, multi-
              ple speakers are identified as a single speaker. If you  specify
              the  MaxSpeakerLabels  field, you must set the ShowSpeakerLabels
              field to true.

          ChannelIdentification -> (boolean)
              Instructs Amazon Transcribe Medical to process each audio  chan-
              nel  separately  and then merge the transcription output of each
              channel into a single transcription.

              Amazon Transcribe Medical also produces a transcription of  each
              item  detected on an audio channel, including the start time and
              end time of the item and alternative transcriptions of item. The
              alternative transcriptions also come with confidence scores pro-
              vided by Amazon Transcribe Medical.

              You can't set both ShowSpeakerLabels  and  ChannelIdentification
              in  the  same  request.  If you set both, your request returns a
              BadRequestException .

          ShowAlternatives -> (boolean)
              Determines whether alternative transcripts are  generated  along
              with  the transcript that has the highest confidence. If you set
              ShowAlternatives field to true, you must also  set  the  maximum
              number of alternatives to return in the MaxAlternatives field.

          MaxAlternatives -> (integer)
              The  maximum number of alternatives that you tell the service to
              return. If you specify the MaxAlternatives field, you  must  set
              the ShowAlternatives field to true.

          VocabularyName -> (string)
              The  name  of  the  vocabulary  to use when processing a medical
              transcription job.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ShowSpeakerLabels=boolean,MaxSpeakerLabels=integer,ChannelIdentification=boolean,ShowAlternatives=boolean,MaxAlternatives=integer,VocabularyName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ShowSpeakerLabels": true|false,
            "MaxSpeakerLabels": integer,
            "ChannelIdentification": true|false,
            "ShowAlternatives": true|false,
            "MaxAlternatives": integer,
            "VocabularyName": "string"
          }

       --content-identification-type (string)
          You can configure Amazon Transcribe Medical to label content in  the
          transcription output. If you specify PHI , Amazon Transcribe Medical
          labels the personal health information (PHI) that it  identifies  in
          the transcription output.

          Possible values:

          o PHI

       --specialty (string)
          The  medical specialty of any clinician speaking in the input media.

          Possible values:

          o PRIMARYCARE

       --type (string)
          The type of speech in the input audio. CONVERSATION refers  to  con-
          versations  between  two  or  more  speakers,  e.g., a conversations
          between doctors and patients.  DICTATION  refers  to  single-speaker
          dictated speech, such as clinical notes.

          Possible values:

          o CONVERSATION

          o DICTATION

       --tags (list)
          Add tags to an Amazon Transcribe medical transcription job.

          (structure)
              A key:value pair that adds metadata to a resource used by Amazon
              Transcribe. For example, a tag with the key:value  pair  Depart-
              ment:Sales  might  be added to a resource to indicate its use by
              your organization's sales department.

              Key -> (string)
                 The first part of a key:value pair that forms a  tag  associ-
                 ated  with  a given resource. For example, in the tag Depart-
                 ment:Sales, the key is 'Department'.

              Value -> (string)
                 The second part of a key:value pair that forms a tag  associ-
                 ated  with  a given resource. For example, in the tag Depart-
                 ment:Sales, the value is 'Sales'.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       Example 5: To transcribe a medical conversation stored as an audio file
       with up to two transcription alternatives

       The following start-medical-transcription-job example creates up to two
       alternative  transcriptions  from a single audio file. Every transcrip-
       tions has a level of confidence associated with it. By default,  Amazon
       Transcribe returns the transcription with the highest confidence level.
       You can specify that Amazon Transcribe return additional transcriptions
       with  lower  confidence  levels.  You specify the location of the tran-
       scription output in the OutputBucketName parameter.

          CompletionTime -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp that shows when the job was completed.

          FailureReason -> (string)
              If the TranscriptionJobStatus field is FAILED , this field  con-
              tains information about why the job failed.

              The FailureReason field contains one of the following values:

              o Unsupported  media  format - The media format specified in the
                MediaFormat field of the request isn't valid. See the descrip-
                tion of the MediaFormat field for a list of valid values.

              o The  media  format  provided does not match the detected media
                format - The media format of the audio file doesn't match  the
                format  specified  in  the  MediaFormat  field in the request.
                Check the media format of your media file and  make  sure  the
                two values match.

              o Invalid sample rate for audio file - The sample rate specified
                in the MediaSampleRateHertz of the request  isn't  valid.  The
                sample rate must be between 8,000 and 48,000 Hertz.

              o The  sample  rate  provided does not match the detected sample
                rate - The sample rate in the audio  file  doesn't  match  the
                sample rate specified in the MediaSampleRateHertz field in the
                request. Check the sample rate of your  media  file  and  make
                sure that the two values match.

              o Invalid  file  size:  file  size  too large - The size of your
                audio file is larger than what Amazon Transcribe  Medical  can
                process.  For  more  information, see Guidelines and Quotas in
                the Amazon Transcribe Medical Guide .

              o Invalid number of channels: number of  channels  too  large  -
                Your audio contains more channels than Amazon Transcribe Medi-
                cal is configured to process. To request additional  channels,
                see Amazon Transcribe Medical Endpoints and Quotas in the Ama-
                zon Web Services General Reference .

          Settings -> (structure)
              Object that contains object.

              ShowSpeakerLabels -> (boolean)
                 Determines whether the transcription job uses speaker  recog-
                 nition  to  identify  different  speakers in the input audio.
                 Speaker recognition labels individual speakers in  the  audio
                 file.  If  you  set  the ShowSpeakerLabels field to true, you
                 must also set the maximum number of  speaker  labels  in  the
                 MaxSpeakerLabels field.

                 You  can't  set both ShowSpeakerLabels and ChannelIdentifica-
                 tion in the same request.  If  you  set  both,  your  request
                 returns a BadRequestException .

              MaxSpeakerLabels -> (integer)
                 The  maximum  number  of  speakers  to  identify in the input
                 audio. If there are more speakers in the audio than this num-
                 ber, multiple speakers are identified as a single speaker. If
                 you specify the MaxSpeakerLabels  field,  you  must  set  the
                 ShowSpeakerLabels field to true.

              ChannelIdentification -> (boolean)
                 Instructs  Amazon  Transcribe  Medical  to process each audio
                 channel separately and then merge the transcription output of
                 each channel into a single transcription.

                 Amazon  Transcribe  Medical  also produces a transcription of
                 each item detected on an audio channel, including  the  start
                 time  and end time of the item and alternative transcriptions
                 of item. The alternative transcriptions also come with confi-
                 dence scores provided by Amazon Transcribe Medical.

                 You  can't  set both ShowSpeakerLabels and ChannelIdentifica-
                 tion in the same request.  If  you  set  both,  your  request
                 returns a BadRequestException .

              ShowAlternatives -> (boolean)
                 Determines  whether  alternative  transcripts  are  generated
                 along with the transcript that has the highest confidence. If
