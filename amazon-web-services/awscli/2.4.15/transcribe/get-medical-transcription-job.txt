NAME
       get-medical-transcription-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  a transcription job from Amazon Transcribe
       Medical. To see the status of the job, check the TranscriptionJobStatus
       field.  If  the status is COMPLETED , the job is finished. You find the
       results of the completed job in the TranscriptFileUri field.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-medical-transcription-job
          --medical-transcription-job-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --medical-transcription-job-name (string)
          The name of the medical transcription job.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about a specific medical transcription job

       The following get-medical-transcription-job  example  gets  information
       about a specific medical transcription job. To access the transcription
       results, use the TranscriptFileUri parameter. If you've  enabled  addi-
       tional features for the transcription job, you can see them in the Set-
       tings object. The Specialty parameter shows the  medical  specialty  of
       the  provider.  The  Type parameter indicates whether the speech in the
       transcription job is of a medical conversation, or a medical dictation.

          FailureReason -> (string)
              If the TranscriptionJobStatus field is FAILED , this field  con-
              tains information about why the job failed.

              The FailureReason field contains one of the following values:

              o Unsupported  media  format - The media format specified in the
                MediaFormat field of the request isn't valid. See the descrip-
                tion of the MediaFormat field for a list of valid values.

              o The  media  format  provided does not match the detected media
                format - The media format of the audio file doesn't match  the
                format  specified  in  the  MediaFormat  field in the request.
                Check the media format of your media file and  make  sure  the
                two values match.

              o Invalid sample rate for audio file - The sample rate specified
                in the MediaSampleRateHertz of the request  isn't  valid.  The
                sample rate must be between 8,000 and 48,000 Hertz.

              o The  sample  rate  provided does not match the detected sample
                rate - The sample rate in the audio  file  doesn't  match  the
                sample rate specified in the MediaSampleRateHertz field in the
                request. Check the sample rate of your  media  file  and  make
                sure that the two values match.

              o Invalid  file  size:  file  size  too large - The size of your
                audio file is larger than what Amazon Transcribe  Medical  can
                process.  For  more  information, see Guidelines and Quotas in
                the Amazon Transcribe Medical Guide .

              o Invalid number of channels: number of  channels  too  large  -
                Your audio contains more channels than Amazon Transcribe Medi-
                cal is configured to process. To request additional  channels,
                see Amazon Transcribe Medical Endpoints and Quotas in the Ama-
                zon Web Services General Reference .

          Settings -> (structure)
              Object that contains object.

              ShowSpeakerLabels -> (boolean)
                 Determines whether the transcription job uses speaker  recog-
                 nition  to  identify  different  speakers in the input audio.
                 Speaker recognition labels individual speakers in  the  audio
                 file.  If  you  set  the ShowSpeakerLabels field to true, you
                 must also set the maximum number of  speaker  labels  in  the
                 MaxSpeakerLabels field.

                 You  can't  set both ShowSpeakerLabels and ChannelIdentifica-
                 tion in the same request.  If  you  set  both,  your  request
                 returns a BadRequestException .

              MaxSpeakerLabels -> (integer)
                 The  maximum  number  of  speakers  to  identify in the input
                 audio. If there are more speakers in the audio than this num-
                 ber, multiple speakers are identified as a single speaker. If
                 you specify the MaxSpeakerLabels  field,  you  must  set  the
                 ShowSpeakerLabels field to true.

              ChannelIdentification -> (boolean)
                 Instructs  Amazon  Transcribe  Medical  to process each audio
                 channel separately and then merge the transcription output of
                 each channel into a single transcription.

                 Amazon  Transcribe  Medical  also produces a transcription of
                 each item detected on an audio channel, including  the  start
                 time  and end time of the item and alternative transcriptions
                 of item. The alternative transcriptions also come with confi-
                 dence scores provided by Amazon Transcribe Medical.

                 You  can't  set both ShowSpeakerLabels and ChannelIdentifica-
                 tion in the same request.  If  you  set  both,  your  request
                 returns a BadRequestException .

              ShowAlternatives -> (boolean)
                 Determines  whether  alternative  transcripts  are  generated
                 along with the transcript that has the highest confidence. If
                 you set ShowAlternatives field to true, you must also set the
                 maximum number of alternatives to return in  the  MaxAlterna-
                 tives field.

              MaxAlternatives -> (integer)
                 The  maximum number of alternatives that you tell the service
                 to return. If you specify the MaxAlternatives field, you must
                 set the ShowAlternatives field to true.

              VocabularyName -> (string)
                 The  name  of the vocabulary to use when processing a medical
                 transcription job.

          ContentIdentificationType -> (string)
              Shows the type of content that you've  configured  Amazon  Tran-
              scribe  Medical to identify in a transcription job. If the value
              is PHI , you've configured the job to identify  personal  health
              information (PHI) in the transcription output.

          Specialty -> (string)
              The medical specialty of any clinicians providing a dictation or
              having a conversation. Refer to Transcribing a medical conversa-
              tion for a list of supported specialties.

          Type -> (string)
              The  type  of  speech  in the transcription job. CONVERSATION is
              generally used for patient-physician dialogues. DICTATION is the
              setting  for  physicians  speaking  their  notes  after seeing a
              patient. For more information, see  What  is  Amazon  Transcribe
              Medical? .

          Tags -> (list)
              A  key:value pair assigned to a given medical transcription job.

              (structure)
                 A key:value pair that adds metadata to  a  resource  used  by
                 Amazon Transcribe. For example, a tag with the key:value pair
                 Department:Sales might be added to a resource to indicate its
                 use by your organization's sales department.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The first part of a key:value pair that forms a tag asso-
                     ciated with a given resource. For  example,  in  the  tag
                     Department:Sales, the key is 'Department'.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  second  part  of  a  key:value pair that forms a tag
                     associated with a given resource. For example, in the tag
                     Department:Sales, the value is 'Sales'.
