       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-vocabulary-filter
          --vocabulary-filter-name <value>
          [--words <value>]
          [--vocabulary-filter-file-uri <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --vocabulary-filter-name (string)
          The  name of the vocabulary filter to update. If you try to update a
          vocabulary filter with the same name as another  vocabulary  filter,
          you get a ConflictException error.

       --words (list)
          The  words to use in the vocabulary filter. Only use characters from
          the character set defined for custom vocabularies.  For  a  list  of
          character sets, see Character Sets for Custom Vocabularies .

          If you provide a list of words in the Words parameter, you can't use
          the VocabularyFilterFileUri parameter.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --vocabulary-filter-file-uri (string)
          The Amazon S3 location of a text file used as input  to  create  the
          vocabulary  filter.  Only  use  characters  from  the  character set
          defined for custom vocabularies. For a list of character  sets,  see
          Character Sets for Custom Vocabularies .

          The specified file must be less than 50 KB of UTF-8 characters.

          If you provide the location of a list of words in the VocabularyFil-
          terFileUri parameter, you can't use the Words parameter.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To replace the words in a vocabulary filter

       The following update-vocabulary-filter example replaces the words in  a
       vocabulary  filter  with new ones. Prerequisite: To update a vocabulary
       filter with the new words, you must have those words saved  as  a  text
       file.

          aws transcribe update-vocabulary-filter \
              --vocabulary-filter-file-uri s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/Amazon-S3-Prefix/your-text-file-to-update-your-vocabulary-filter.txt \
              --vocabulary-filter-name vocabulary-filter-name

       Output:

          {
              "VocabularyFilterName": "vocabulary-filter-name",
              "LanguageCode": "language-code",
              "LastModifiedTime": "2020-09-23T18:40:35.139000+00:00"
          }
