DESCRIBE-LANGUAGE-MODEL()                            DESCRIBE-LANGUAGE-MODEL()



NAME
       describe-language-model -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  information about a single custom language model. Use this infor-
       mation to see details about the language model in your Amazon Web  Ser-
       vices account. You can also see whether the base language model used to
       create your custom language model has been  updated.  If  Amazon  Tran-
       scribe has updated the base model, you can create a new custom language
       model using the updated base model. If the language model  wasn't  cre-
       ated,  you  can  use this operation to understand why Amazon Transcribe
       couldn't create it.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-language-model
          --model-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --model-name (string)
          The name of the custom language model you submit to get more  infor-
          mation.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about a specific custom language model

       The  following describe-language-model example gets information about a
       specific custom language model. For example,  under  BaseModelName  you
       can  see  whether  your model is trained using a NarrowBand or WideBand
       model. Custom language models with a NarrowBand base  model  can  tran-
       scribe audio with a sample rate less than 16 kHz. Language models using
       a WideBand base model can transcribe audio with a sample  rate  greater
       than  16 kHz. The S3Uri parameter indicates the Amazon S3 prefix you've
       used to access the training data to create the custom language model.

          aws transcribe describe-language-model \
              --model-name cli-clm-example

       Output:

          {
              "LanguageModel": {
                  "ModelName": "cli-clm-example",
                  "CreateTime": "2020-09-25T17:57:38.504000+00:00",

                  }
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       LanguageModel -> (structure)
          The name of the custom language model you requested more information
          about.

          ModelName -> (string)
              The name of the custom language model.

          CreateTime -> (timestamp)
              The time the custom language model was created.

          LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
              The most recent time the custom language model was modified.

          LanguageCode -> (string)
              The language code you used to create your custom language model.

          BaseModelName -> (string)

              The  creation status of a custom language model. When the status
              is COMPLETED the model is ready for use.

                 files that you use to train your custom language model.
