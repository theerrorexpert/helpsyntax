NAME

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about vocabulary filters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-vocabulary-filters
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--name-contains <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          If  the  result of the previous request to ListVocabularyFilters was
          truncated, include the NextToken to fetch the next  set  of  collec-
          tions.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of filters to return in each page of results. If
          there are fewer results than the value you specify, only the  actual
          results  are returned. If you do not specify a value, the default of
          5 is used.

       --name-contains (string)
          Filters the response so that it  only  contains  vocabulary  filters
          whose name contains the specified string.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The ListVocabularyFilters operation returns a page of collections at
          a time. The maximum size of the page is set by the MaxResults param-
          eter.  If there are more jobs in the list than the page size, Amazon
          Transcribe returns the NextPage token. Include the token in the next
          request to the ListVocabularyFilters operation to return in the next
          page of jobs.

       VocabularyFilters -> (list)
          The list of vocabulary filters. It contains at most MaxResults  num-
          ber  of filters. If there are more filters, call the ListVocabulary-
          Filters operation again with the NextToken parameter in the  request
          set to the value of the NextToken field in the response.

          (structure)
              Provides information about a vocabulary filter.

              VocabularyFilterName -> (string)
                 The name of the vocabulary filter. The name must be unique in
                 the account that holds the filter.

              LanguageCode -> (string)
                 The language code of the words in the vocabulary filter.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the vocabulary was last updated.
