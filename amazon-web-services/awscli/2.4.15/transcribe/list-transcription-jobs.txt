DESCRIPTION
       Lists transcription jobs with the specified status.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-transcription-jobs
          [--status <value>]
          [--job-name-contains <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --status (string)
          When  specified,  returns only transcription jobs with the specified
          status. Jobs are ordered by creation  date,  with  the  newest  jobs
          returned  first.  If  you  dont  specify a status, Amazon Transcribe
          returns all transcription jobs ordered by creation date.

          Possible values:

          o QUEUED

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o FAILED

          o COMPLETED

       --job-name-contains (string)
          When specified, the jobs returned in the list are  limited  to  jobs
          whose name contains the specified string.

       --next-token (string)
          If  the  result  of the previous request to ListTranscriptionJobs is
          truncated, include the NextToken to fetch the next set of jobs.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of jobs to return in each  page  of  results.  If
          there  are fewer results than the value you specify, only the actual
          results are returned. If you do not specify a value, the default  of
          5 is used.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Status -> (string)
          The requested status of the jobs returned.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  ListTranscriptionJobs  operation  returns  a  page of jobs at a
          time. The maximum size of the page is set by the MaxResults  parame-
          ter.  If  there are more jobs in the list than the page size, Amazon
          Transcribe returns the NextPage token. Include the token in the next
          request to the ListTranscriptionJobs operation to return in the next
          page of jobs.

       TranscriptionJobSummaries -> (list)
          A list of objects containing summary information for a transcription
          job.

          (structure)
              Provides a summary of information about a transcription job.

              TranscriptionJobName -> (string)
                 The name of the transcription job.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp that shows when the job was created.

              StartTime -> (timestamp)

              LanguageCode -> (string)
                 The language code for the input speech.

              TranscriptionJobStatus -> (string)
                 The  status of the transcription job. When the status is COM-
                 PLETED , use the GetTranscriptionJob  operation  to  get  the
                 results of the transcription.

              FailureReason -> (string)
                 If the TranscriptionJobStatus field is FAILED , a description
                 of the error.

              OutputLocationType -> (string)
                 Indicates the location of the  output  of  the  transcription
                 job.

                 bucket specified in the outputBucketName field when the tran-
                 scription  job  was  started  with  the StartTranscriptionJob
                 operation.

                 If the value is SERVICE_BUCKET then the output is  stored  by
                 Amazon  Transcribe  and can be retrieved using the URI in the
                 GetTranscriptionJob response's TranscriptFileUri field.

              ContentRedaction -> (structure)
                 The content redaction settings of the transcription job.

                 RedactionType -> (string)
                     Request  parameter  that  defines  the  entities  to   be
                     redacted. The only accepted value is PII .

                 RedactionOutput -> (string)

                     When you choose redacted_and_unredacted Amazon Transcribe
                     outputs both the redacted and unredacted transcripts.

                 PiiEntityTypes -> (list)
                     The types of personally  identifiable  information  (PII)
                     you want to redact in your transcript.

                     (string)

              ModelSettings -> (structure)
                 The  object  used  to call your custom language model to your
                 transcription job.

                 LanguageModelName -> (string)
                     The name of your custom language model.

              IdentifyLanguage -> (boolean)

                 A  value between zero and one that Amazon Transcribe assigned
                 to the language it identified in the source audio.  A  higher
                 score  indicates  that Amazon Transcribe is more confident in
