LIST-LANGUAGE-MODELS()                                  LIST-LANGUAGE-MODELS()



NAME
       list-language-models -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  more information about the custom language models you've cre-
       ated. You can use the information in this list to find a specific  cus-
       tom language model. You can then use the operation to get more informa-
       tion about it.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-language-models
          [--status-equals <value>]
          [--name-contains <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --status-equals (string)
          When specified, returns only custom language models with the  speci-
          fied  status. Language models are ordered by creation date, with the
          newest models first. If you don't specify  a  status,  Amazon  Tran-
          scribe returns all custom language models ordered by date.

          Possible values:

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o FAILED

          o COMPLETED

       --name-contains (string)
          When specified, the custom language model names returned contain the
          substring you've specified.

       --next-token (string)
          When included, fetches the next set of jobs if  the  result  of  the
          previous request was truncated.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  language  models to return in each page of
          results. If there are fewer results than the value you specify, only
          the  actual results are returned. If you do not specify a value, the
          default of 5 is used.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list your custom language models

       The following list-language-models example lists  the  custom  language
       models  associated  with  your  AWS account and Region. You can use the
       S3Uri and TuningDataS3Uri parameters to find  the  Amazon  S3  prefixes
       you've  used as your training data, or your tuning data. The BaseModel-
       Name tells you whether you've used a NarrowBand, or WideBand  model  to
       create  a custom language model. You can transcribe audio with a sample
       rate of less than 16 kHz with a custom language model using  a  Narrow-
       Band base model. You can transcribe audio 16 kHz or greater with a cus-
       tom language model using a WideBand base model. The ModelStatus parame-
       ter shows whether you can use the custom language model in a transcrip-
       tion job. If the value is COMPLETED, you can use it in a  transcription
       job.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The  operation returns a page of jobs at a time. The maximum size of
          the list is set by the MaxResults parameter. If there are more  lan-
          guage  models  in  the  list  than  the page size, Amazon Transcribe
          returns the NextPage token. Include the token in the next request to
          the operation to return the next page of language models.

       Models -> (list)
          A  list of objects containing information about custom language mod-
          els.

          (structure)
              The structure used to describe a custom language model.

              ModelName -> (string)
                 The name of the custom language model.

              CreateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time the custom language model was created.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The most recent time the custom language model was  modified.

              LanguageCode -> (string)
                 The  language  code  you  used to create your custom language
                 model.

              BaseModelName -> (string)
                 The Amazon Transcribe standard language model, or base  model
                 used to create the custom language model.

              ModelStatus -> (string)
                 The creation status of a custom language model. When the sta-
                 tus is COMPLETED the model is ready for use.

              UpgradeAvailability -> (boolean)
                 Whether the base model used for the custom language model  is
                 up  to  date.  If this field is true then you are running the
                 most up-to-date version of the base model in your custom lan-
                 guage model.

              FailureReason -> (string)

                     The Amazon S3 prefix you specify to access the plain text
                     files that you use to train your custom language model.

                 TuningDataS3Uri -> (string)
                     The Amazon S3 prefix you specify to access the plain text

                 DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies
                     the permissions you've given Amazon Transcribe to  access
                     your  Amazon  S3  buckets  containing your media files or
                     text  data.  ARNs  have  the  format   arn:partition:ser-
