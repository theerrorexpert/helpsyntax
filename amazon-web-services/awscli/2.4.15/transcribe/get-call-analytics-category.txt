NAME
       get-call-analytics-category -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information about a call analytics category.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-call-analytics-category
          --category-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --category-name (string)
          The  name  of the category you want information about. This value is
          case sensitive.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CategoryProperties -> (structure)
          The rules you've defined for a category.

          CategoryName -> (string)
              The name of the call analytics category.

          Rules -> (list)
              The rules used to create a call analytics category.

              (structure)
                 A condition in the call between the customer  and  the  agent
                 that you want to filter for.

                 NonTalkTimeFilter -> (structure)
                     A  condition  for a time period when neither the customer
                     nor the agent was talking.

                     Threshold -> (long)
                        The duration of the period when neither  the  customer
                        nor agent was talking.

                     AbsoluteTimeRange -> (structure)
                        An object you can use to specify a time range (in mil-
                        liseconds) for when no one is  talking.  For  example,
                        you  could  specify  a  time period between the 30,000
                        millisecond mark and the 45,000 millisecond mark.  You
                        could also specify the time period as the first 15,000
                        milliseconds or the last 15,000 milliseconds.

                        StartTime -> (long)
                            A value that indicates the beginning of  the  time
                            range  in seconds. To set absolute time range, you
                            must specify a start time and  an  end  time.  For
                            example, if you specify the following values:

                            o StartTime - 10000

                            o Endtime - 50000

                            The  time range is set between 10,000 milliseconds
                            and 50,000 milliseconds into the call.

                        EndTime -> (long)
                            A value that indicates the end of the  time  range
                            in  milliseconds.  To set absolute time range, you
                            must specify a start time and  an  end  time.  For
                            example, if you specify the following values:

                            o StartTime - 10000

                            o Endtime - 50000

                            The  time range is set between 10,000 milliseconds
                            and 50,000 milliseconds into the call.

                        First -> (long)
                            A time range from the beginning of the call to the
                            value  that  you've specified. For example, if you
                            specify 100000 , the time  range  is  set  to  the
                            first 100,000 milliseconds of the call.

                        Last -> (long)
                            A  time range from the value that you've specified
                            to the end of the call. For example, if you  spec-
                            ify  100000  ,  the  time range is set to the last
                            100,000 milliseconds of the call.

                     RelativeTimeRange -> (structure)
                        An object that allows percentages to specify the  pro-
                        portion of the call where there was silence. For exam-
                        ple, you can specify the first half of the  call.  You
                        can  also  specify  the period of time between halfway
                        through to three-quarters of the way through the call.
                        Because  the  length  of conversation can vary between
                        calls, you can apply relative time ranges  across  all
                        calls.

                        StartPercentage -> (integer)
                            A  value  that  indicates  the  percentage  of the
                            beginning of the time range.  To  set  a  relative
                            time  range,  you  must specify a start percentage
                            and an end percentage. For example, if you specify
                            the following values:

                            o StartPercentage - 10

                            o EndPercentage - 50

                            This  looks at the time range starting from 10% of
                            the way into the call to 50% of  the  way  through
                            the  call. For a call that lasts 100,000 millisec-
                            onds, this example  range  would  apply  from  the
                            10,000  millisecond mark to the 50,000 millisecond
                            mark.

                        EndPercentage -> (integer)
                            A value that indicates the percentage of  the  end
                            of  the  time range. To set a relative time range,
                            you must specify a start  percentage  and  an  end
                            percentage.  For  example, if you specify the fol-
                            lowing values:

                            o StartPercentage - 10

                            o EndPercentage - 50

                            This looks at the time range starting from 10%  of
                            the  way  into  the call to 50% of the way through
                            the call. For a call that lasts 100,000  millisec-
                            onds,  this  example  range  would  apply from the
                            10,000 millisecond mark to the 50,000  millisecond
                            mark.

                        First -> (integer)
                            A  range  that takes the portion of the call up to
                            the time in milliseconds set  by  the  value  that
                            you've  specified.  For  example,  if  you specify
                            120000 , the time  range  is  set  for  the  first
                            120,000 milliseconds of the call.

                        Last -> (integer)
                            A  range  that  takes the portion of the call from
                            the time in milliseconds set  by  the  value  that
                            you've specified to the end of the call. For exam-
                            ple, if you specify 120000 , the time range is set
                            for the last 120,000 milliseconds of the call.

                     Negate -> (boolean)
                        Set to TRUE to look for a time period when people were
                        talking.

                 InterruptionFilter -> (structure)
                     A condition for a time period when either the customer or
                     agent was interrupting the other person.

                     Threshold -> (long)
                        The duration of the interruption.

                     ParticipantRole -> (string)
                        Indicates  whether  the  caller or customer was inter-
                        rupting.

                     AbsoluteTimeRange -> (structure)
                        An object you can use to specify a time range (in mil-
                        liseconds)  for  when you'd want to find the interrup-
                        tion. For example, you could search for  an  interrup-
                        tion  between  the  30,000  millisecond  mark  and the
                        45,000 millisecond mark. You could  also  specify  the
                        time  period  as  the first 15,000 milliseconds or the
                        last 15,000 milliseconds.

                        StartTime -> (long)
                            A value that indicates the beginning of  the  time
                            range  in seconds. To set absolute time range, you
                            must specify a start time and  an  end  time.  For
                            example, if you specify the following values:

                            o StartTime - 10000

                            o Endtime - 50000

                            The  time range is set between 10,000 milliseconds
                            and 50,000 milliseconds into the call.

                        EndTime -> (long)
                            A value that indicates the end of the  time  range
                            in  milliseconds.  To set absolute time range, you
                            must specify a start time and  an  end  time.  For
                            example, if you specify the following values:

                            o StartTime - 10000

                            o Endtime - 50000

                            The  time range is set between 10,000 milliseconds
                            and 50,000 milliseconds into the call.

                        First -> (long)
                            A time range from the beginning of the call to the
                            value  that  you've specified. For example, if you
                            specify 100000 , the time  range  is  set  to  the
                            first 100,000 milliseconds of the call.

                        Last -> (long)
                            A  time range from the value that you've specified
                            to the end of the call. For example, if you  spec-
                            ify  100000  ,  the  time range is set to the last
                            100,000 milliseconds of the call.

                     RelativeTimeRange -> (structure)
                        An object that allows percentages to specify the  pro-
                        portion  of  the  call where there was a interruption.
                        For example, you can specify the  first  half  of  the
                        call.  You can also specify the period of time between
                        halfway through to three-quarters of the  way  through
                        the  call. Because the length of conversation can vary
                        between calls, you  can  apply  relative  time  ranges
                        across all calls.

                        StartPercentage -> (integer)
                            A  value  that  indicates  the  percentage  of the
                            beginning of the time range.  To  set  a  relative
                            time  range,  you  must specify a start percentage
                            and an end percentage. For example, if you specify
                            the following values:

                            o StartPercentage - 10

                            o EndPercentage - 50

                            This  looks at the time range starting from 10% of
                            the way into the call to 50% of  the  way  through
                            the  call. For a call that lasts 100,000 millisec-
                            onds, this example  range  would  apply  from  the
                            10,000  millisecond mark to the 50,000 millisecond
                            mark.

                        EndPercentage -> (integer)
                            A value that indicates the percentage of  the  end
                            of  the  time range. To set a relative time range,
                            you must specify a start  percentage  and  an  end
                            percentage.  For  example, if you specify the fol-
                            lowing values:

                            o StartPercentage - 10

                            o EndPercentage - 50

                            This looks at the time range starting from 10%  of
                            the  way  into  the call to 50% of the way through
                            the call. For a call that lasts 100,000  millisec-
                            onds,  this  example  range  would  apply from the

                            mark.

                        First -> (integer)
                            A  range  that takes the portion of the call up to
                            the time in milliseconds set  by  the  value  that
                            you've  specified.  For  example,  if  you specify
                            120000 , the time  range  is  set  for  the  first
                            120,000 milliseconds of the call.

                        Last -> (integer)
                            A  range  that  takes the portion of the call from
                            the time in milliseconds set  by  the  value  that
                            you've specified to the end of the call. For exam-
                            ple, if you specify 120000 , the time range is set
                            for the last 120,000 milliseconds of the call.

                     Negate -> (boolean)
                        Set  to TRUE to look for a time period where there was

                 TranscriptFilter -> (structure)
                     A condition that  catches  particular  words  or  phrases
                     based  on  a  exact  match.  For  example, if you set the
                     phrase "I want to speak to the manager", only that  exact
                     phrase will be returned.

                     TranscriptFilterType -> (string)
                        Matches  the  phrase  to the transcription output in a
                        word for word fashion. For example, if you specify the
                        phrase  "I want to speak to the manager." Amazon Tran-
                        scribe attempts to match that specific phrase  to  the
                        transcription.

                     AbsoluteTimeRange -> (structure)
                        A  time  range,  set in seconds, between two points in
                        the call.

                        StartTime -> (long)
                            A value that indicates the beginning of  the  time
                            range  in seconds. To set absolute time range, you
                            must specify a start time and  an  end  time.  For
                            example, if you specify the following values:

                            o StartTime - 10000

                            o Endtime - 50000

                            The  time range is set between 10,000 milliseconds
                            and 50,000 milliseconds into the call.

                        EndTime -> (long)
                            A value that indicates the end of the  time  range
                            in  milliseconds.  To set absolute time range, you
                            must specify a start time and  an  end  time.  For
                            example, if you specify the following values:

                            o StartTime - 10000

                            o Endtime - 50000

                            The  time range is set between 10,000 milliseconds
                            and 50,000 milliseconds into the call.

                        First -> (long)
                            A time range from the beginning of the call to the
                            value  that  you've specified. For example, if you
                            specify 100000 , the time  range  is  set  to  the
                            first 100,000 milliseconds of the call.

                        Last -> (long)
                            A  time range from the value that you've specified
                            to the end of the call. For example, if you  spec-
                            ify  100000  ,  the  time range is set to the last
                            100,000 milliseconds of the call.

                     RelativeTimeRange -> (structure)
                        An object that allows percentages to specify the  pro-
                        portion  of  the  call where you would like to apply a
                        filter. For example, you can specify the first half of
                        the  call.  You  can  also  specify the period of time
                        between halfway through to three-quarters of  the  way
                        through  the  call. Because the length of conversation
                        can vary between calls, you can  apply  relative  time
                        ranges across all calls.

                        StartPercentage -> (integer)
                            A  value  that  indicates  the  percentage  of the
                            beginning of the time range.  To  set  a  relative
                            time  range,  you  must specify a start percentage
                            and an end percentage. For example, if you specify
                            the following values:

                            o StartPercentage - 10

                            o EndPercentage - 50

                            This  looks at the time range starting from 10% of
                            the way into the call to 50% of  the  way  through
                            the  call. For a call that lasts 100,000 millisec-
                            onds, this example  range  would  apply  from  the
                            10,000  millisecond mark to the 50,000 millisecond
                            mark.

                        EndPercentage -> (integer)
                            A value that indicates the percentage of  the  end
                            of  the  time range. To set a relative time range,
                            you must specify a start  percentage  and  an  end
                            percentage.  For  example, if you specify the fol-
                            lowing values:

                            o StartPercentage - 10

                            o EndPercentage - 50

                            This looks at the time range starting from 10%  of
                            the  way  into  the call to 50% of the way through
                            the call. For a call that lasts 100,000  millisec-
                            onds,  this  example  range  would  apply from the
                            10,000 millisecond mark to the 50,000  millisecond
                            mark.

                        First -> (integer)
                            A  range  that takes the portion of the call up to
                            the time in milliseconds set  by  the  value  that
                            you've  specified.  For  example,  if  you specify
                            120000 , the time  range  is  set  for  the  first
                            120,000 milliseconds of the call.

                        Last -> (integer)
                            A  range  that  takes the portion of the call from
                            the time in milliseconds set  by  the  value  that
                            you've specified to the end of the call. For exam-
                            ple, if you specify 120000 , the time range is set
                            for the last 120,000 milliseconds of the call.

                     ParticipantRole -> (string)
                        Determines whether the customer or the agent is speak-
                        ing the phrases that you've specified.

                     Negate -> (boolean)
                        If TRUE , the rule that  you  specify  is  applied  to
                        everything except for the phrases that you specify.

                     Targets -> (list)
                        The  phrases that you're specifying for the transcript
                        filter to match.

                        (string)

                 SentimentFilter -> (structure)
                     A condition that is applied to a particular customer sen-
                     timent.

                     Sentiments -> (list)
                        An  array  that  enables you to specify sentiments for
                        the customer or agent. You can  specify  one  or  more
                        values.

                        (string)

                     AbsoluteTimeRange -> (structure)
                        The time range, measured in seconds, of the sentiment.

                        StartTime -> (long)
                            A value that indicates the beginning of  the  time
                            range  in seconds. To set absolute time range, you
                            must specify a start time and  an  end  time.  For
                            example, if you specify the following values:

                            o StartTime - 10000

                            o Endtime - 50000

                            The  time range is set between 10,000 milliseconds
                            and 50,000 milliseconds into the call.

                        EndTime -> (long)
                            A value that indicates the end of the  time  range
                            in  milliseconds.  To set absolute time range, you
                            must specify a start time and  an  end  time.  For
                            example, if you specify the following values:

                            o StartTime - 10000

                            o Endtime - 50000

                            The  time range is set between 10,000 milliseconds
                            and 50,000 milliseconds into the call.

                        First -> (long)
                            A time range from the beginning of the call to the
                            value  that  you've specified. For example, if you
                            specify 100000 , the time  range  is  set  to  the
                            first 100,000 milliseconds of the call.

                        Last -> (long)
                            A  time range from the value that you've specified
                            to the end of the call. For example, if you  spec-
                            ify  100000  ,  the  time range is set to the last
                            100,000 milliseconds of the call.

                     RelativeTimeRange -> (structure)
                        The time range, set in percentages, that correspond to
                        proportion of the call.

                        StartPercentage -> (integer)
                            A  value  that  indicates  the  percentage  of the
                            beginning of the time range.  To  set  a  relative
                            time  range,  you  must specify a start percentage
                            and an end percentage. For example, if you specify
                            the following values:

                            o StartPercentage - 10

                            o EndPercentage - 50

                            This  looks at the time range starting from 10% of
                            the way into the call to 50% of  the  way  through
                            the  call. For a call that lasts 100,000 millisec-
                            onds, this example  range  would  apply  from  the
                            10,000  millisecond mark to the 50,000 millisecond
                            mark.

                        EndPercentage -> (integer)
                            A value that indicates the percentage of  the  end
                            of  the  time range. To set a relative time range,
                            you must specify a start  percentage  and  an  end
                            percentage.  For  example, if you specify the fol-
                            lowing values:

                            o StartPercentage - 10

                            o EndPercentage - 50

                            This looks at the time range starting from 10%  of
                            the  way  into  the call to 50% of the way through
                            the call. For a call that lasts 100,000  millisec-

                            mark.

                        First -> (integer)
                            A  range  that takes the portion of the call up to
                            the time in milliseconds set  by  the  value  that
                            you've  specified.  For  example,  if  you specify
                            120000 , the time  range  is  set  for  the  first
                            120,000 milliseconds of the call.

                        Last -> (integer)
                            A  range  that  takes the portion of the call from
                            the time in milliseconds set  by  the  value  that
                            you've specified to the end of the call. For exam-
                            ple, if you specify 120000 , the time range is set
                            for the last 120,000 milliseconds of the call.

                     ParticipantRole -> (string)
                        A  value that determines whether the sentiment belongs
                        to the customer or the agent.

                     Negate -> (boolean)
                        Set to TRUE to look for sentiments that weren't speci-
                        fied in the request.

          CreateTime -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp that shows when the call analytics category was cre-
              ated.

          LastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp that shows when the call analytics category was most
              recently updated.
