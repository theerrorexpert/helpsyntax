GET-TRANSCRIPTION-JOB()                                GET-TRANSCRIPTION-JOB()



NAME
       get-transcription-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about a transcription job. To see the status of the
       job, check the TranscriptionJobStatus field. If the status is COMPLETED
       ,  the  job  is  finished  and you can find the results at the location
       specified in the TranscriptFileUri field. If you enable content  redac-
       tion, the redacted transcript appears in RedactedTranscriptFileUri .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-transcription-job
          --transcription-job-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --transcription-job-name (string)
          The name of the job.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about a specific transcription job

       The  following  get-transcription-job  example gets information about a
       specific transcription job. To access the  transcription  results,  use
       the  TranscriptFileUri parameter. Use the MediaFileUri parameter to see
       which audio file you transcribed with this job. You can  use  the  Set-
       tings  object  to see the optional features you've enabled in the tran-
       scription job.

              The name of the transcription job.

          TranscriptionJobStatus -> (string)
              The status of the transcription job.

          LanguageCode -> (string)
              The language code for the input speech.

          MediaSampleRateHertz -> (integer)
              The  sample rate, in Hertz (Hz), of the audio track in the input
              media file.

          MediaFormat -> (string)
              The format of the input media file.

          Media -> (structure)
              An object that describes the input media for  the  transcription
              job.

              MediaFileUri -> (string)
                 The  S3 object location of the input media file. The URI must
                 be in the same region as the API endpoint that you are  call-
                 ing. The general form is:
                     s3://<AWSDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET>/<keyprefix>/<objectkey>

                 For example:
                     s3://AWSDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/example.mp4

                     s3://AWSDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/mediadocs/example.mp4

                 For  more  information about S3 object names, see Object Keys
                 in the Amazon S3 Developer Guide .

              RedactedMediaFileUri -> (string)
                 The S3 object location for your redacted output  media  file.
                 This is only supported for call analytics jobs.

          Transcript -> (structure)
              An object that describes the output of the transcription job.

              TranscriptFileUri -> (string)
                 The S3 object location of the transcript.

                 Use this URI to access the transcript. If you specified an S3
                 bucket in the OutputBucketName field  when  you  created  the
                 job,  this  is  the URI of that bucket. If you chose to store
                 the transcript in Amazon Transcribe, this is a shareable  URL
                 that provides secure access to that location.

              RedactedTranscriptFileUri -> (string)
                 The S3 object location of the redacted transcript.

                 Use this URI to access the redacted transcript. If you speci-
                 fied an S3 bucket in the OutputBucketName field when you cre-
                 ated the job, this is the URI of that bucket. If you chose to
                 store the transcript in Amazon Transcribe, this is  a  share-
                 able URL that provides secure access to that location.

          StartTime -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp that shows when the job started processing.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp that shows when the job was created.

          CompletionTime -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp that shows when the job completed.

          FailureReason -> (string)
              If  the TranscriptionJobStatus field is FAILED , this field con-
              tains information about why the job failed.

              The FailureReason field can contain one of the following values:

              o Unsupported  media  format - The media format specified in the
                MediaFormat field of the request isn't valid. See the descrip-
                tion of the MediaFormat field for a list of valid values.

              o The  media  format  provided does not match the detected media
                format - The media format of the audio file doesn't match  the
                format  specified  in  the  MediaFormat  field in the request.
                Check the media format of your media file and make  sure  that
                the two values match.

              o Invalid sample rate for audio file - The sample rate specified
                in the MediaSampleRateHertz of the request  isn't  valid.  The
                sample rate must be between 8,000 and 48,000 Hertz.

              o The  sample  rate  provided does not match the detected sample
                rate - The sample rate in the audio  file  doesn't  match  the
                sample rate specified in the MediaSampleRateHertz field in the
                request. Check the sample rate of your  media  file  and  make
                sure that the two values match.

              o Invalid  file  size:  file  size  too large - The size of your
                audio file is larger than Amazon Transcribe can  process.  For
                more  information,  see Limits in the Amazon Transcribe Devel-
                oper Guide .

              o Invalid number of channels: number of  channels  too  large  -
                Your  audio  contains  more channels than Amazon Transcribe is
                configured to process. To  request  additional  channels,  see
                Amazon  Transcribe  Limits  in the Amazon Web Services General
                Reference .

          Settings -> (structure)
              Optional settings for the transcription job. Use these  settings
              to  turn  on  speaker  recognition, to set the maximum number of
              speakers that should be  identified  and  to  specify  a  custom
              vocabulary to use when processing the transcription job.

              VocabularyName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  a  vocabulary to use when processing the tran-
                 scription job.

              ShowSpeakerLabels -> (boolean)
                 Determines whether the transcription job uses speaker  recog-
                 nition  to  identify  different  speakers in the input audio.
                 Speaker recognition labels individual speakers in  the  audio
                 file.  If  you  set  the ShowSpeakerLabels field to true, you
                 must also set the maximum number of speaker labels  MaxSpeak-
                 erLabels field.

                 You  can't  set both ShowSpeakerLabels and ChannelIdentifica-
                 tion in the same request.  If  you  set  both,  your  request
                 returns a BadRequestException .

              MaxSpeakerLabels -> (integer)
                 The  maximum  number  of  speakers  to  identify in the input
                 audio. If there are more speakers in the audio than this num-
                 ber, multiple speakers are identified as a single speaker. If
                 you specify the MaxSpeakerLabels  field,  you  must  set  the
                 ShowSpeakerLabels field to true.

              ChannelIdentification -> (boolean)
                 Instructs  Amazon  Transcribe  to  process each audio channel
                 separately and then merge the transcription  output  of  each
                 channel into a single transcription.

                 Amazon  Transcribe also produces a transcription of each item
                 detected on an audio channel, including the  start  time  and
                 end  time  of  the item and alternative transcriptions of the
                 item including the confidence that Amazon Transcribe  has  in
                 the transcription.

                 You  can't  set both ShowSpeakerLabels and ChannelIdentifica-
                 tion in the same request.  If  you  set  both,  your  request
                 returns a BadRequestException .

              ShowAlternatives -> (boolean)
                 Determines  whether  the  transcription  contains alternative
                 transcriptions. If you  set  the  ShowAlternatives  field  to
                 true, you must also set the maximum number of alternatives to
                 return in the MaxAlternatives field.

              MaxAlternatives -> (integer)
                 The number of alternative  transcriptions  that  the  service
                 should  return. If you specify the MaxAlternatives field, you
                 must set the ShowAlternatives field to true.

              VocabularyFilterName -> (string)
                 The name of the vocabulary filter to  use  when  transcribing
                 the  audio.  The  filter  that you specify must have the same
                 language code as the transcription job.

              VocabularyFilterMethod -> (string)
                 Set to mask to remove filtered text from the  transcript  and
                 replace it with three asterisks ("
                 **

                 *
                 ") as placeholder text. Set to remove to remove filtered text
                 from the transcript without using placeholder  text.  Set  to
                 tag to mark the word in the transcription output that matches
                 the vocabulary filter. When you set the filter method to  tag
                 , the words matching your vocabulary filter are not masked or
                 removed.

          ModelSettings -> (structure)
              An object containing the details of your custom language  model.

              LanguageModelName -> (string)
                 The name of your custom language model.

          JobExecutionSettings -> (structure)
              Provides  information about how a transcription job is executed.

              AllowDeferredExecution -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether a job should be queued by Amazon Transcribe
                 when  the  concurrent  execution  limit is exceeded. When the
                 AllowDeferredExecution field is true,  jobs  are  queued  and
                 executed  when  the  number of executing jobs falls below the
                 concurrent execution limit. If the  field  is  false,  Amazon
                 Transcribe returns a LimitExceededException exception.

                 Note  that job queuing is enabled by default for call analyt-
                 ics jobs.

                 If you specify the  AllowDeferredExecution  field,  you  must
                 specify the DataAccessRoleArn field.

              DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN),  in  the  form arn:parti-
                 tion:service:region:account-id:resource-type/resource-id , of
                 a  role  that  has  access to the S3 bucket that contains the
                 input files. Amazon Transcribe  assumes  this  role  to  read
                 queued media files. If you have specified an output S3 bucket
                 for the transcription results, this role should  have  access
                 to the output bucket as well.

                 If  you  specify  the  AllowDeferredExecution field, you must
                 specify the DataAccessRoleArn field.

          ContentRedaction -> (structure)
              An object that describes  content  redaction  settings  for  the
              transcription job.

              RedactionType -> (string)
                 Request  parameter  that defines the entities to be redacted.
                 The only accepted value is PII .

              RedactionOutput -> (string)
                 The output transcript file stored in either  the  default  S3
                 bucket or in a bucket you specify.

                 When  you  choose redacted Amazon Transcribe outputs only the
                 redacted transcript.

                 When you  choose  redacted_and_unredacted  Amazon  Transcribe
                 outputs both the redacted and unredacted transcripts.

              PiiEntityTypes -> (list)
                 The  types  of  personally identifiable information (PII) you
                 want to redact in your transcript.

                 (string)

          IdentifyLanguage -> (boolean)
              A value that shows  if  automatic  language  identification  was
              enabled for a transcription job.

          LanguageOptions -> (list)
              An  object  that  shows the optional array of languages inputted
              for transcription jobs with  automatic  language  identification
              enabled.

              (string)

          IdentifiedLanguageScore -> (float)
              A  value between zero and one that Amazon Transcribe assigned to
              the language that it identified in the source audio. Larger val-
              ues indicate that Amazon Transcribe has higher confidence in the
              language it identified.

          Tags -> (list)
              A key:value pair assigned to a given transcription job.

              (structure)
                 A key:value pair that adds metadata to  a  resource  used  by
                 Amazon Transcribe. For example, a tag with the key:value pair
                 Department:Sales might be added to a resource to indicate its
                 use by your organization's sales department.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The first part of a key:value pair that forms a tag asso-
                     ciated with a given resource. For  example,  in  the  tag
                     Department:Sales, the key is 'Department'.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  second  part  of  a  key:value pair that forms a tag
                     associated with a given resource. For example, in the tag
                     Department:Sales, the value is 'Sales'.

          Subtitles -> (structure)
              Generate subtitles for your batch transcription job.

              Formats -> (list)
                 Specify  the  output  format  for  your subtitle file; if you
                 select both SRT and VTT formats, two output files are  gener-
                 ated.

                 (string)

              SubtitleFileUris -> (list)
                 Choose the output location for your subtitle file. This loca-
                 tion must be an S3 bucket.

                 (string)

          LanguageIdSettings -> (map)
              Language-specific settings that can be specified  when  language
              identification is enabled for your transcription job. These set-
              tings include VocabularyName , VocabularyFilterName ,  and  Lan-
              guageModelName .

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                 Language-specific  settings  that  can be specified when lan-
                 guage identification is enabled.

                 VocabularyName -> (string)
                     The name of the vocabulary you want to use when  process-
                     ing  your  transcription  job. The vocabulary you specify
                     must have the same language codes  as  the  transcription
                     job;  if  the languages don't match, the vocabulary isn't
                     applied.
