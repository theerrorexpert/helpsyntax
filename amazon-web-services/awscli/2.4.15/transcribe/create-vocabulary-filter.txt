NAME
       create-vocabulary-filter -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a new vocabulary filter that you can use to filter words, such
       as profane words, from the output of a transcription job.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-vocabulary-filter
          --vocabulary-filter-name <value>
          --language-code <value>
          [--words <value>]
          [--vocabulary-filter-file-uri <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --vocabulary-filter-name (string)
          The vocabulary filter name. The  name  must  be  unique  within  the
          account  that  contains it. If you try to create a vocabulary filter
          with the same name as another vocabulary  filter,  you  get  a  Con-
          flictException error.

       --language-code (string)
          The  language  code of the words in the vocabulary filter. All words
          in the filter must be in the same language.  The  vocabulary  filter
          can  only be used with transcription jobs in the specified language.

       --words (list)
          The words to use in the vocabulary filter. Only use characters  from
          the  character  set  defined  for custom vocabularies. For a list of
          character sets, see Character Sets for Custom Vocabularies .

          If you provide a list of words in the Words parameter, you can't use
          the VocabularyFilterFileUri parameter.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --vocabulary-filter-file-uri (string)
          The  Amazon  S3  location of a text file used as input to create the
          vocabulary filter.  Only  use  characters  from  the  character  set
          defined  for  custom vocabularies. For a list of character sets, see
          Character Sets for Custom Vocabularies .

          The specified file must be less than 50 KB of UTF-8 characters.

          If you provide the location of a list of words in the VocabularyFil-
          terFileUri parameter, you can't use the Words parameter.

       --tags (list)
          Adds  one  or  more tags, each in the form of a key:value pair, to a
          new Amazon Transcribe vocabulary filter at the time you create  this
          new vocabulary filter.

          (structure)
              A key:value pair that adds metadata to a resource used by Amazon
              Transcribe. For example, a tag with the key:value  pair  Depart-
              ment:Sales  might  be added to a resource to indicate its use by
              your organization's sales department.

              Key -> (string)
                 The first part of a key:value pair that forms a  tag  associ-
                 ated  with  a given resource. For example, in the tag Depart-
                 ment:Sales, the key is 'Department'.

              Value -> (string)
                 The second part of a key:value pair that forms a tag  associ-
                 ated  with  a given resource. For example, in the tag Depart-
                 ment:Sales, the value is 'Sales'.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a vocabulary filter

       The following create-vocabulary-filter  example  creates  a  vocabulary
       filter  that  uses  a  text file that contains a list of words that you
       wouldn't want to appear in a transcription. For language-code,  specify
       the language code corresponding to the language of your vocabulary fil-
       ter. For vocabulary-filter-file-uri, specify the Amazon Simple  Storage
       Service  (Amazon  S3) URI of the text file. For vocabulary-filter-name,
       specify the name of your vocabulary filter.

          aws transcribe create-vocabulary-filter \
              --language-code language-code \
              --vocabulary-filter-file-uri s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/vocabulary-filter.txt \
              --vocabulary-filter-name cli-vocabulary-filter-example

       Output:

          {
              "VocabularyFilterName": "cli-vocabulary-filter-example",
              "LanguageCode": "language-code"
          }

       For more information, see Filtering Unwanted Words in the Amazon  Tran-
       scribe Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       VocabularyFilterName -> (string)
          The name of the vocabulary filter.

       LanguageCode -> (string)
          The language code of the words in the collection.

       LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that the vocabulary filter was modified.
