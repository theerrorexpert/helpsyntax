LOOKUP-EVENTS()                                                LOOKUP-EVENTS()



NAME
       lookup-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Looks  up management events or CloudTrail Insights events that are cap-
       tured by CloudTrail. You can look up events that occurred in  a  region
       within  the  last 90 days. Lookup supports the following attributes for
       management events:

       o Amazon Web Services access key

       o Event ID

       o Event name

       o Event source

       o Read only

       o Resource name

       o Resource type

       o User name

       Lookup supports the following attributes for Insights events:

       o Event ID

       o Event name

       o Event source

       All attributes are optional. The default number of results returned  is
       50,  with  a maximum of 50 possible. The response includes a token that
       you can use to get the next page of results.

       WARNING:
          The rate of lookup requests  is  limited  to  two  per  second,  per
          account,  per  region. If this limit is exceeded, a throttling error
          occurs.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       lookup-events is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Events

            lookup-events
          [--lookup-attributes <value>]
          [--start-time <value>]
          [--end-time <value>]

OPTIONS
       --lookup-attributes (list)
          Contains a list of lookup attributes. Currently the list can contain
          only one item.

          (structure)
              Specifies  an  attribute  and  value  that  filter  the   events
              returned.

              AttributeKey -> (string)
                 Specifies   an  attribute  on  which  to  filter  the  events
                 returned.

              AttributeValue -> (string)
                 Specifies a value for the specified AttributeKey.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AttributeKey=string,AttributeValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "AttributeKey": "EventId"|"EventName"|"ReadOnly"|"Username"|"ResourceType"|"ResourceName"|"EventSource"|"AccessKeyId",
              "AttributeValue": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --start-time (timestamp)
          Specifies that only events that occur after or at the specified time
          are returned. If the specified start time is after the specified end
          time, an error is returned.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          Specifies that only events that occur before  or  at  the  specified
          time are returned. If the specified end time is before the specified
          start time, an error is returned.

       --event-category (string)
          Specifies the event category. If you do not specify an  event  cate-
          gory,  events  of the category are not returned in the response. For
          example, if you do not specify insight as the value of EventCategory
          , no Insights events are returned.

          Possible values:

          o insight

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To look up events for a trail

       The following lookup-events command looks up API activity events by the
       attribute EventName:

          aws cloudtrail lookup-events --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=EventName,AttributeValue=ConsoleLogin

       Output:

          {
            "Events": [
               {
                   "EventId": "654ccbc0-ba0d-486a-9076-dbf7274677a7",

            ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Events -> (list)
          A  list  of events returned based on the lookup attributes specified
          and the CloudTrail event. The events list is  sorted  by  time.  The
          most recent event is listed first.

          (structure)
              Contains  information  about  an  event  that  was returned by a
              lookup request. The result includes a representation of a Cloud-
              Trail event.

              EventId -> (string)
                 The CloudTrail ID of the event returned.

              EventName -> (string)
                 The name of the event returned.

              ReadOnly -> (string)
                 Information  about  whether  the  event is a write event or a
                 read event.

              AccessKeyId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services access key ID that was used  to  sign
                 the  request. If the request was made with temporary security
                 credentials, this is the access key ID of the temporary  cre-
                 dentials.

              EventTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time of the event returned.

              EventSource -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web  Services  service  to which the request was
                 made.

              Username -> (string)
                 A user name or role name of the requester that called the API
                 in the event returned.

              Resources -> (list)
                 A list of resources referenced by the event returned.

                 (structure)
                     Specifies  the  type and name of a resource referenced by
                     an event.

                     ResourceType -> (string)
                        The  type  of  a  resource  referenced  by  the  event
                        returned. When the resource type cannot be determined,
                        null is returned. Some examples of resource types are:
                        Instance for EC2, Trail for CloudTrail, DBInstance for
                        Amazon RDS, and AccessKey for IAM. To learn more about
                        how to look up and filter events by the resource types
                        supported for  a  service,  see  Filtering  CloudTrail
                        Events .

                     ResourceName -> (string)
                        The  name  of  the  resource  referenced  by the event
                        returned. These are user-created  names  whose  values
                        will  depend  on  the  environment.  For  example, the
                        resource name might be  "auto-scaling-test-group"  for
                        an  Auto  Scaling  Group  or  "i-1234567"  for  an EC2
                        Instance.

              CloudTrailEvent -> (string)
                 A JSON string that contains a  representation  of  the  event
                 returned.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token  to  use to get the next page of results after a previous
          API call. If the token does not appear, there are no more results to
          return.  The token must be passed in with the same parameters as the
          previous call. For  example,  if  the  original  call  specified  an
          AttributeKey  of  'Username'  with  a value of 'root', the call with
          NextToken should include those same parameters.
