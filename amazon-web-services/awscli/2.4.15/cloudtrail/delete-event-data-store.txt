DELETE-EVENT-DATA-STORE()                            DELETE-EVENT-DATA-STORE()



NAME
       delete-event-data-store -

DESCRIPTION
       Disables  the  event  data  store  specified  by EventDataStore , which
       accepts an event data store ARN. After you run  DeleteEventDataStore  ,
       the  event data store enters a PENDING_DELETION state, and is automati-
       cally deleted after a wait period of seven days.  TerminationProtectio-
       nEnabled  must  be set to False on the event data store; this operation
       cannot work if TerminationProtectionEnabled is True .

       After you run DeleteEventDataStore on an event data store,  you  cannot
       run  ListQueries  ,  DescribeQuery , or GetQueryResults on queries that
       are using an event data store in a  PENDING_DELETION  state.  An  event
       data store in the PENDING_DELETION state does not incur costs.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-event-data-store
          --event-data-store <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --event-data-store (string)
          The  ARN  (or  the  ID suffix of the ARN) of the event data store to
          delete.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
