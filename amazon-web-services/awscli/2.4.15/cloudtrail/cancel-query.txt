CANCEL-QUERY()                                                  CANCEL-QUERY()



NAME
       cancel-query -

DESCRIPTION
       Cancels a query if the query is not in a terminated state, such as CAN-
       CELLED , FAILED or FINISHED . You must specify an ARN value for  Event-
       DataStore  .  The  ID  of  the  query  that  you want to cancel is also
       required. When you run CancelQuery , the query  status  might  show  as
       CANCELLED even if the operation is not yet finished.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            cancel-query
          --event-data-store <value>
          --query-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --event-data-store (string)
          The  ARN  (or  the  ID  suffix of the ARN) of an event data store on
          which the specified query is running.

       --query-id (string)
          The ID of the query that you want to cancel. The QueryId comes  from
          the response of a StartQuery operation.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       QueryId -> (string)
          The ID of the canceled query.

       QueryStatus -> (string)
          Shows  the status of a query after a CancelQuery request. Typically,
          the values shown are either RUNNING or CANCELLED .
