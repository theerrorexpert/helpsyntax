NAME

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  event data results of a query. You must specify the QueryID value
       returned by the StartQuery operation, and an ARN for EventDataStore .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-query-results
          --event-data-store <value>
          --query-id <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-query-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --event-data-store (string)
          The ARN (or ID suffix of the ARN) of the event  data  store  against
          which the query was run.

       --query-id (string)
          The ID of the query for which you want to get results.

       --next-token (string)
          A token you can use to get the next page of query results.

       --max-query-results (integer)
          The maximum number of query results to display on a single page.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
