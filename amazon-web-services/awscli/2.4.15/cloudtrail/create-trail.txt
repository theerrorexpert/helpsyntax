OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          Specifies the name of the trail. The name must  meet  the  following
          requirements:

          o Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), periods (.),
            underscores (_), or dashes (-)

          o Start with a letter or number, and end with a letter or number

          o Be between 3 and 128 characters

          o Have no  adjacent  periods,  underscores  or  dashes.  Names  like
            my-_namespace and my--namespace are not valid.

          o Not be in IP address format (for example, 192.168.5.4)

       --s3-bucket-name (string)
          Specifies the name of the Amazon S3 bucket designated for publishing
          log files. See Amazon S3 Bucket Naming Requirements .

       --s3-key-prefix (string)
          Specifies the Amazon S3 key prefix that comes after the name of  the
          bucket  you have designated for log file delivery. For more informa-
          tion, see Finding Your CloudTrail Log Files . The maximum length  is
          200 characters.

       --sns-topic-name (string)
          Specifies  the name of the Amazon SNS topic defined for notification
          of log file delivery. The maximum length is 256 characters.

       --include-global-service-events  |   --no-include-global-service-events
       (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  the  trail is publishing events from global ser-
          vices such as IAM to the log files.

       --is-multi-region-trail | --no-is-multi-region-trail (boolean)
          Specifies whether the trail is created in the current region  or  in
          all regions. The default is false, which creates a trail only in the
          region where you are signed in. As a best practice, consider  creat-
          ing trails that log events in all regions.

       --enable-log-file-validation      |     --no-enable-log-file-validation
       (boolean)
          Specifies whether log file  integrity  validation  is  enabled.  The
          default is false.

          NOTE:
              When  you  disable  log  file integrity validation, the chain of
              digest files is broken after one hour. CloudTrail does not  cre-
              ate  digest  files  for  log  files that were delivered during a
              period in which log file integrity validation was disabled.  For
              example,  if you enable log file integrity validation at noon on
              January 1, disable it at noon on January 2, and re-enable it  at
              noon on January 10, digest files will not be created for the log
              files delivered from noon on January 2 to noon  on  January  10.
              The  same applies whenever you stop CloudTrail logging or delete
              a trail.

       --cloud-watch-logs-log-group-arn (string)
          Specifies a log group name using an Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN),  a
          unique  identifier that represents the log group to which CloudTrail
          logs will be delivered.  Not  required  unless  you  specify  Cloud-
          WatchLogsRoleArn .

       --cloud-watch-logs-role-arn (string)
          Specifies  the  role  for  the CloudWatch Logs endpoint to assume to
          write to a user's log group.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          Specifies the KMS key ID to use to encrypt  the  logs  delivered  by
          CloudTrail.  The  value can be an alias name prefixed by "alias/", a
          fully specified ARN to an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key,  or
          a globally unique identifier.

          CloudTrail also supports KMS multi-Region keys. For more information
          about multi-Region keys, see Using multi-Region keys in the Key Man-
          agement Service Developer Guide .

          Examples:

          o alias/MyAliasName

          o arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName

          o arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

          o 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

       --is-organization-trail | --no-is-organization-trail (boolean)
          Specifies whether the trail is created for all accounts in an  orga-
          nization  in  Organizations, or only for the current Amazon Web Ser-
          vices account. The default is false, and cannot be true  unless  the
          call is made on behalf of an Amazon Web Services account that is the
          management account for an organization in Organizations.

       --tags-list (list)
          A list of tags.

          (structure)
              A custom key-value pair associated with a  resource  such  as  a
              CloudTrail trail.

              Key -> (string)
                 The  key  in  a  key-value  pair.  The key must be must be no
                 longer than 128 Unicode characters. The key  must  be  unique
                 for the resource to which it applies.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value in a key-value pair of a tag. The value must be no
                 longer than 256 Unicode characters.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
