GET-INSIGHT-SELECTORS()                                GET-INSIGHT-SELECTORS()



NAME
       get-insight-selectors -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  settings for the Insights event selectors that you con-
       figured  for  your  trail.  GetInsightSelectors  shows  if   CloudTrail
       Insights  event  logging  is  enabled on the trail, and if it is, which
       insight types are enabled. If you run GetInsightSelectors  on  a  trail
       that  does  not  have Insights events enabled, the operation throws the
       exception InsightNotEnabledException

       For more information, see Logging CloudTrail Insights Events for Trails
       in the CloudTrail User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-insight-selectors
          --trail-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --trail-name (string)
          Specifies the name of the trail or trail ARN. If you specify a trail
          name, the string must meet the following requirements:

          o Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), periods (.),
            underscores (_), or dashes (-)

          o Start with a letter or number, and end with a letter or number

          o Be between 3 and 128 characters

          o Have  no  adjacent  periods,  underscores  or  dashes.  Names like
            my-_namespace and my--namespace are not valid.

          o Not be in IP address format (for example, 192.168.5.4)

          If you specify a trail ARN, it must be in the format:
              arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TrailARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a trail for which you want to  get
          Insights selectors.

       InsightSelectors -> (list)
          A  JSON  string that contains the insight types you want to log on a
          trail. In this release, ApiErrorRateInsight  and  ApiCallRateInsight
          are supported as insight types.

          (structure)
              A  JSON  string  that  contains a list of insight types that are
              logged on a trail.

              InsightType -> (string)
                 The type of insights to log on  a  trail.  ApiCallRateInsight
