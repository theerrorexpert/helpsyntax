RESTORE-EVENT-DATA-STORE()                          RESTORE-EVENT-DATA-STORE()



NAME
       restore-event-data-store -

DESCRIPTION
       Restores a deleted event data store specified by EventDataStore , which
       accepts an event data store ARN. You can only restore a  deleted  event
       data  store  within the seven-day wait period after deletion. Restoring
       an event data store can take several minutes, depending on the size  of
       the event data store.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            restore-event-data-store
          --event-data-store <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --event-data-store (string)
          The  ARN  (or the ID suffix of the ARN) of the event data store that
          you want to restore.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EventDataStoreArn -> (string)
          The event data store ARN.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the event data store.

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the event data store.

       AdvancedEventSelectors -> (list)
          The advanced event selectors that were used to select events.

          (structure)
              Advanced event selectors let you create  fine-grained  selectors
              for  the  following  CloudTrail event record elds. They help you
              control costs by logging only those events that are important to
              you.  For  more  information about advanced event selectors, see
              Logging data events for trails in the CloudTrail User Guide .

              o readOnly

              o eventSource

              o eventName

              o eventCategory

              o resources.type

              o resources.ARN

              You cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event  selec-
              tors to a trail.

              Name -> (string)
                 An optional, descriptive name for an advanced event selector,
                 such as "Log data events for only two S3 buckets".

              FieldSelectors -> (list)
                 Contains all selector statements in an advanced event  selec-
                 tor.

                 (structure)
                     A  single  selector statement in an advanced event selec-
                     tor.

                     Field -> (string)
                        A field in an event record on which to  filter  events
                        to  be  logged.  Supported  fields  include readOnly ,
                        eventCategory , eventSource (for  management  events),
                        eventName , resources.type , and resources.ARN .

                        o
                          **
                          readOnly ** - Optional. Can be set to Equals a value
                          of true or false . If you do  not  add  this  field,
                          CloudTrail  logs  both both read and write events. A
                          value of true logs only  read  events.  A  value  of
                          false logs only write events.

                        o
                          **
                          eventSource  **  -  For  filtering management events
                          only. This can be set only to NotEquals  kms.amazon-
                          aws.com .

                        o
                          **
                          eventName  ** - Can use any operator. You can use it
                          to lter in or lter out  any  data  event  logged  to
                          CloudTrail,  such as PutBucket or GetSnapshotBlock .
                          You can have multiple values for this eld, separated
                          by commas.

                        o
                          **
                          eventCategory  ** - This is required. It must be set
                          to Equals , and the value must be Management or Data
                          .

                        o
                          **
                          resources.type   **   -   This   eld   is  required.
                          resources.type can only use the Equals operator, and
                          the value can be one of the following:

                          o AWS::S3::Object

                          o AWS::Lambda::Function

                          o AWS::DynamoDB::Table

                          o AWS::S3Outposts::Object

                          o AWS::ManagedBlockchain::Node

                          o AWS::S3ObjectLambda::AccessPoint

                          o AWS::EC2::Snapshot

                          o AWS::S3::AccessPoint

                          o AWS::DynamoDB::Stream

                          o AWS::Glue::Table

                        You can have only one resources.type eld per selector.
                        To log data events on more than one resource type, add
                        another selector.

                        o
                          **
                          resources.ARN  **  -  You  can use any operator with
                          resources.ARN , but if you use Equals or NotEquals ,
                          the  value  must  exactly  match  the ARN of a valid
                          resource of the type you've specied in the  template
                          as  the  value  of  resources.type.  For example, if
                          resources.type equals AWS::S3::Object , the ARN must
                          be  in one of the following formats. To log all data
                          events for all objects in a specific S3 bucket,  use
                          the StartsWith operator, and include only the bucket
                          ARN as the matching value.  The  trailing  slash  is
                          intentional;  do  not  exclude  it. Replace the text
                          between less than and greater than symbols (<>) with
                          resource-specific information.

                          o arn:<partition>:s3:::<bucket_name>/

                          o arn:<partition>:s3:::<bucket_name>/<object_path>/

                        When  resources.type equals AWS::S3::AccessPoint , and
                        the operator is set to Equals or NotEquals ,  the  ARN
                        must be in one of the following formats. To log events
                        on all objects in an S3  access  point,  we  recommend
                        that  you  use only the access point ARN, dont include
                        the object  path,  and  use  the  StartsWith  or  Not-
                        StartsWith operators.

                        and the operator is set to Equals or NotEquals  ,  the
                        ARN must be in the following format:

                        When resources.type equals  AWS::EC2::Snapshot  ,  and

                        value of the event record field specified as the value
                        of Field . This is the only valid  operator  that  you
                        can  use  with  the  readOnly  ,  eventCategory  , and
