DESCRIBE-QUERY()                                              DESCRIBE-QUERY()



NAME
       describe-query -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  metadata  about a query, including query run time in millisec-
       onds, number of events scanned and matched, and query status. You  must
       specify an ARN for EventDataStore , and a value for QueryID .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-query
          --event-data-store <value>
          --query-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --event-data-store (string)
          The  ARN  (or  the  ID  suffix of the ARN) of an event data store on
          which the specified query was run.

       --query-id (string)
          The query ID.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       QueryId -> (string)
          The ID of the query.

       QueryString -> (string)
          The SQL code of a query.

       QueryStatus -> (string)

       QueryStatistics -> (structure)
          Metadata  about  a  query,  including the number of events that were
          matched, the total number of events scanned, the query run  time  in
          milliseconds, and the query's creation time.

          EventsMatched -> (long)
              The number of events that matched a query.

          EventsScanned -> (long)
              The  number  of  events that the query scanned in the event data
              store.

          ExecutionTimeInMillis -> (integer)
              The query's run time, in milliseconds.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
