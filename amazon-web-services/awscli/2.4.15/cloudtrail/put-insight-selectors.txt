SYNOPSIS
            put-insight-selectors
          --trail-name <value>
          --insight-selectors <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --trail-name (string)
          The name of the CloudTrail trail for which you want to change or add
          Insights selectors.

       --insight-selectors (list)
          A JSON string that contains the insight types you want to log  on  a
          trail.  ApiCallRateInsight and ApiErrorRateInsight are valid insight
          types.

          (structure)
              A JSON string that contains a list of  insight  types  that  are
              logged on a trail.

              InsightType -> (string)
                 The  type  of  insights to log on a trail. ApiCallRateInsight
                 and ApiErrorRateInsight are valid insight types.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          InsightType=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "InsightType": "ApiCallRateInsight"|"ApiErrorRateInsight"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
