PUT-EVENT-SELECTORS()                                    PUT-EVENT-SELECTORS()



NAME
       put-event-selectors -

DESCRIPTION
       Configures  an  event  selector  or  advanced  event selectors for your
       trail. Use event selectors or advanced event selectors to specify  man-
       agement and data event settings for your trail. By default, trails cre-
       ated without specific event selectors are configured to  log  all  read
       and write management events, and no data events.

       When  an  event  occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event
       selectors or advanced event selectors in all trails. For each trail, if
       the  event matches any event selector, the trail processes and logs the
       event. If the event doesn't match any event selector, the trail doesn't
       log the event.

       Example

       o You  create  an  event selector for a trail and specify that you want
         write-only events.

       o The EC2 GetConsoleOutput and RunInstances  API  operations  occur  in
         your account.

       o CloudTrail evaluates whether the events match your event selectors.

       o The  RunInstances  is  a  write-only  event and it matches your event
         selector. The trail logs the event.

       o The GetConsoleOutput is a read-only event  that  doesn't  match  your
         event selector. The trail doesn't log the event.

       The PutEventSelectors operation must be called from the region in which
       the trail was created; otherwise, an InvalidHomeRegionException  excep-
       tion is thrown.

       You  can  configure up to five event selectors for each trail. For more
       information, see Logging data and  management  events  for  trails  and
       Quotas in CloudTrail in the CloudTrail User Guide .

       You  can add advanced event selectors, and conditions for your advanced
       event selectors, up to a maximum of 500 values for all  conditions  and
       selectors  on  a  trail.  You  can use either AdvancedEventSelectors or
       EventSelectors , but not both. If you apply AdvancedEventSelectors to a
       trail,  any  existing EventSelectors are overwritten. For more informa-
       tion about advanced event selectors, see Logging data events for trails
       in the CloudTrail User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            put-event-selectors
          --trail-name <value>
          [--event-selectors <value>]
          [--advanced-event-selectors <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --trail-name (string)
          Specifies the name of the trail or trail ARN. If you specify a trail
          name, the string must meet the following requirements:

          o Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), periods (.),
            underscores (_), or dashes (-)

          o Start with a letter or number, and end with a letter or number

          o Be between 3 and 128 characters

          o Have  no  adjacent  periods,  underscores  or  dashes.  Names like
            my-_namespace and my--namespace are not valid.

          o Not be in IP address format (for example, 192.168.5.4)

          If you specify a trail ARN, it must be in the following format.
              arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail

       --event-selectors (list)
          Specifies the settings for your event selectors. You  can  configure
          up  to five event selectors for a trail. You can use either EventSe-
          lectors or AdvancedEventSelectors in  a  PutEventSelectors  request,
          but  not  both. If you apply EventSelectors to a trail, any existing
          AdvancedEventSelectors are overwritten.

          (structure)
              Use event selectors to further specify the management  and  data
              event  settings for your trail. By default, trails created with-
              out specific event selectors will be configured to log all  read
              and  write  management events, and no data events. When an event
              occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event  selector
              for  all  trails. For each trail, if the event matches any event
              selector, the trail processes and logs the event. If  the  event
              doesn't  match  any  event  selector,  the trail doesn't log the
              event.

              You can configure up to five event selectors for a trail.

              You cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event  selec-
              tors to a trail.

              ReadWriteType -> (string)
                 Specify  if  you  want  your  trail  to log read-only events,
                 write-only events, or all. For example, the  EC2  GetConsole-
                 Output  is  a  read-only  API operation and RunInstances is a
                 write-only API operation.

                 By default, the value is All .

              IncludeManagementEvents -> (boolean)
                 Specify if you want your event selector to include management
                 events for your trail.

                 For more information, see Management Events in the CloudTrail
                 User Guide .

                 By default, the value is true .

                 The first copy of management events is free. You are  charged
                 for  additional copies of management events that you are log-
                 ging on any subsequent trail in the  same  region.  For  more
                 information  about CloudTrail pricing, see CloudTrail Pricing
                 .

              DataResources -> (list)
                 CloudTrail supports data event logging for Amazon S3 objects,
                 Lambda functions, and Amazon DynamoDB tables with basic event
                 selectors. You can specify up to 250 resources for  an  indi-
                 vidual event selector, but the total number of data resources
                 cannot exceed 250 across all event selectors in a trail. This
                 limit  does  not  apply if you configure resource logging for
                 all data events.

                 For more information, see Data Events and  Limits  in  Cloud-
                 Trail in the CloudTrail User Guide .

                 (structure)
                     The  Amazon  S3  buckets,  Lambda  functions,  or  Amazon
                     DynamoDB tables that you specify in your event  selectors
                     for  your  trail  to log data events. Data events provide
                     information about the resource operations performed on or
                     within  a  resource  itself. These are also known as data
                     plane  operations.  You  can  specify  up  to  250   data
                     resources for a trail.

                     NOTE:
                        The  total  number  of  allowed data resources is 250.
                        This number can be distributed between 1 and  5  event
                        selectors,  but the total cannot exceed 250 across all
                        selectors.

                        If you are using advanced event selectors, the maximum
                        total  number of values for all conditions, across all
                        advanced event selectors for the trail, is 500.

                     The following example demonstrates how logging works when
                     you configure logging of all data events for an S3 bucket
                     named bucket-1 . In this  example,  the  CloudTrail  user
                     specified  an  empty  prefix,  and the option to log both
                     Read and Write data events.

                     o A user uploads an image file to bucket-1 .

                     o The  PutObject  API   operation   is   an   Amazon   S3
                       object-level  API.  It  is  recorded as a data event in
                       CloudTrail. Because the CloudTrail user specified an S3
                       bucket  with  an empty prefix, events that occur on any
                       object in that bucket are logged. The  trail  processes
                       and logs the event.

                     o A  user  uploads an object to an Amazon S3 bucket named
                       arn:aws:s3:::bucket-2 .

                     o The PutObject API operation occurred for an  object  in
                       an  S3  bucket  that the CloudTrail user didn't specify
                       for the trail. The trail doesnt log the event.

                     The following example demonstrates how logging works when
                     you  configure logging of Lambda data events for a Lambda
                     function named MyLambdaFunction , but not for all  Lambda
                     functions.

                     o A  user  runs  a  script  that  includes  a call to the
                       MyLambdaFunction function and the MyOtherLambdaFunction
                       function.

                     o The  Invoke  API  operation  on  MyLambdaFunction is an
                       Lambda API. It is recorded as a data  event  in  Cloud-
                       Trail.  Because  the  CloudTrail user specified logging
                       data events for MyLambdaFunction , any  invocations  of
                       that  function are logged. The trail processes and logs
                       the event.

                     o The Invoke API operation on MyOtherLambdaFunction is an
                       Lambda API. Because the CloudTrail user did not specify
                       logging data  events  for  all  Lambda  functions,  the
                       Invoke  operation  for  MyOtherLambdaFunction  does not
                       match the function specified for the trail.  The  trail
                       doesnt log the event.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The  resource  type  in  which  you  want  to log data
                        events. You can  specify  the  following  basic  event
                        selector resource types:

                        o AWS::S3::Object

                        o AWS::Lambda::Function

                        o AWS::DynamoDB::Table

                        The following resource types are also availble through
                        advanced  event  selectors.   Basic   event   selector
                        resource  types are valid in advanced event selectors,
                        but advanced event selector  resource  types  are  not
                        valid  in basic event selectors. For more information,
                        see  AdvancedFieldSelector$Field .

                        o AWS::S3Outposts::Object

                        o AWS::ManagedBlockchain::Node

                        o AWS::S3ObjectLambda::AccessPoint

                        o AWS::EC2::Snapshot

                        o AWS::S3::AccessPoint

                        o AWS::DynamoDB::Stream

                        o AWS::Glue::Table

                     Values -> (list)
                        An array of Amazon Resource Name (ARN) strings or par-
                        tial ARN strings for the specified objects.

                        o To log data events for all objects in all S3 buckets
                          in your Amazon Web  Services  account,  specify  the
                          prefix as arn:aws:s3::: .

                        NOTE:
                            This  also  enables logging of data event activity
                            performed by any user or role in your  Amazon  Web
                            Services  account,  even  if that activity is per-
                            formed on a bucket that belongs to another  Amazon
                            Web Services account.

                        o To  log data events for all objects in an S3 bucket,
                          specify the bucket and an empty object  prefix  such
                          as  arn:aws:s3:::bucket-1/  .  The  trail  logs data
                          events for all objects in this S3 bucket.

                        o To log data events for specific objects, specify the
                          S3    bucket    and    object    prefix    such   as
                          arn:aws:s3:::bucket-1/example-images  .  The   trail
                          logs  data events for objects in this S3 bucket that
                          match the prefix.

                        o To log data events for all Lambda functions in  your
                          Amazon  Web  Services account, specify the prefix as
                          arn:aws:lambda .

                        NOTE:
                            This also enables logging of Invoke activity  per-
                            formed by any user or role in your Amazon Web Ser-
                            vices account, even if that activity is  performed
                            on  a  function that belongs to another Amazon Web
                            Services account.

                        o To log data events for a specific  Lambda  function,
                          specify the function ARN.

                        NOTE:
                            Lambda  function  ARNs  are exact. For example, if
                            you       specify       a       function       ARN
                            arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:func-
                            tion:helloworld , data events will only be  logged
                            for    arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:func-
                            tion:helloworld . They  will  not  be  logged  for
                            arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:func-
                            tion:helloworld2 .

                        o To log data events for all DynamoDB tables  in  your
                          Amazon  Web  Services account, specify the prefix as
                          arn:aws:dynamodb .

                        (string)

              ExcludeManagementEventSources -> (list)
                 An optional list of service event sources from which  you  do
                 not  want  management  events  to be logged on your trail. In
                 this release, the list can be empty (disables the filter), or
                 it  can  filter out Key Management Service or Amazon RDS Data
                 API events by containing kms.amazonaws.com or rdsdata.amazon-
                 aws.com . By default, ExcludeManagementEventSources is empty,
                 and KMS and Amazon RDS Data API events  are  logged  to  your
                 trail.  You  can  exclude  management  event  sources only in
                 regions that support the event source.

                 (string)

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ReadWriteType": "ReadOnly"|"WriteOnly"|"All",
              "IncludeManagementEvents": true|false,
              "DataResources": [
                {
                  "Type": "string",
                  "Values": ["string", ...]
                }
                ...
              ],
              "ExcludeManagementEventSources": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --advanced-event-selectors (list)
          Specifies the settings for advanced event  selectors.  You  can  add
          advanced  event  selectors,  and  conditions for your advanced event
          selectors, up to a maximum of 500  values  for  all  conditions  and
          selectors  on  a trail. You can use either AdvancedEventSelectors or
          EventSelectors , but not both. If you  apply  AdvancedEventSelectors
          to  a  trail,  any existing EventSelectors are overwritten. For more
          information about advanced event selectors, see Logging data  events
          for trails in the CloudTrail User Guide .

          (structure)
              Advanced  event  selectors let you create fine-grained selectors
              for the following CloudTrail event record elds.  They  help  you
              control costs by logging only those events that are important to
              you. For more information about advanced  event  selectors,  see
              Logging data events for trails in the CloudTrail User Guide .

              o readOnly

              o eventSource

              o eventName

              o eventCategory

              o resources.type

              o resources.ARN

              You  cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event selec-
              tors to a trail.

              Name -> (string)
                 An optional, descriptive name for an advanced event selector,
                 such as "Log data events for only two S3 buckets".

              FieldSelectors -> (list)
                 Contains  all selector statements in an advanced event selec-
                 tor.

                 (structure)
                     A single selector statement in an advanced  event  selec-

                     Field -> (string)
                        A  field  in an event record on which to filter events
                        to be logged.  Supported  fields  include  readOnly  ,
                        eventCategory  ,  eventSource (for management events),
                        eventName , resources.type , and resources.ARN .

                        o
                          **
                          readOnly ** - Optional. Can be set to Equals a value
                          of  true  or  false  . If you do not add this field,
                          CloudTrail logs both both read and write  events.  A
                          value  of  true  logs  only  read events. A value of
                          false logs only write events.

                        o
                          **
                          eventSource ** -  For  filtering  management  events
                          only. This can be set only to NotEquals  kms.amazon-
                          aws.com .

                        o
                          **
                          eventName ** - Can use any operator. You can use  it
                          to  lter  in  or  lter  out any data event logged to
                          CloudTrail, such as PutBucket or GetSnapshotBlock  .
                          You can have multiple values for this eld, separated
                          by commas.

                        o
                          **
                          eventCategory ** - This is required. It must be  set
                          to Equals , and the value must be Management or Data
                          .

                        o
                          **
                          resources.type  **   -   This   eld   is   required.
                          resources.type can only use the Equals operator, and
                          the value can be one of the following:

                          o AWS::S3::Object

                          o AWS::Lambda::Function

                          o AWS::DynamoDB::Table

                          o AWS::S3Outposts::Object

                          o AWS::ManagedBlockchain::Node

                          o AWS::S3ObjectLambda::AccessPoint

                          o AWS::EC2::Snapshot

                          o AWS::S3::AccessPoint

                          o AWS::DynamoDB::Stream

                          o AWS::Glue::Table

                        You can have only one resources.type eld per selector.
                        To log data events on more than one resource type, add
                        another selector.

                        o
                          **
                          resources.ARN ** - You can  use  any  operator  with
                          resources.ARN , but if you use Equals or NotEquals ,
                          the value must exactly match  the  ARN  of  a  valid
                          resource  of the type you've specied in the template
                          as the value  of  resources.type.  For  example,  if
                          resources.type equals AWS::S3::Object , the ARN must
                          be in one of the following formats. To log all  data
                          events  for all objects in a specific S3 bucket, use
                          the StartsWith operator, and include only the bucket
                          ARN  as  the  matching  value. The trailing slash is
                          intentional; do not exclude  it.  Replace  the  text
                          between less than and greater than symbols (<>) with
                          resource-specific information.

                          o arn:<partition>:s3:::<bucket_name>/

                          o arn:<partition>:s3:::<bucket_name>/<object_path>/

                        When resources.type equals AWS::S3::AccessPoint ,  and
                        the  operator  is set to Equals or NotEquals , the ARN
                        must be in one of the following formats. To log events
                        on  all  objects  in  an S3 access point, we recommend
                        that you use only the access point ARN,  dont  include
                        the  object  path,  and  use  the  StartsWith  or Not-
                        StartsWith operators.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To configure event selectors for a trail

       To  create  an event selector, run the ''put-event-selectors'' command.
       When an event occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the configu-
       ration  for  your trails. If the event matches any event selector for a
       trail, the trail processes and logs the event.  You can configure up to
       5 event selectors for a trail and up to 250 data resources for a trail.

       The following example creates an  event  selector  for  a  trail  named
       ''TrailName''  to  include  read-only and write-only management events,
       data events for two Amazon  S3  bucket/prefix  combinations,  and  data
       events     for     a     single     AWS     Lambda    function    named
       ''hello-world-python-function'':

          aws cloudtrail put-event-selectors --trail-name TrailName --event-selectors '[{"ReadWriteType": "All","IncludeManagementEvents": true,"DataResources": [{"Type":"AWS::S3::Object", "Values": ["arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/prefix","arn:aws:s3:::mybucket2/prefix2"]},{"Type": "AWS::Lambda::Function","Values": ["arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:999999999999:function:hello-world-python-function"]}]}]'

       Output:

          {
            "EventSelectors": [
                {
                    "IncludeManagementEvents": true,
                    "DataResources": [
                        {
                            "Values": [
                                "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/prefix",

            "TrailARN": "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/TrailName"
          }

       The following example creates an  event  selector  for  a  trail  named
       ''TrailName2''  that  includes  all  events,  including  read-only  and
       write-only management events, and all data events  for  all  Amazon  S3
       buckets and AWS Lambda functions in the AWS account:

            ],
            "TrailARN": "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/TrailName2"
          }

OUTPUT
       TrailARN -> (string)
          Specifies  the  ARN  of the trail that was updated with event selec-
          tors. The following is the format of a trail ARN.
              arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail

       EventSelectors -> (list)
          Specifies the event selectors configured for your trail.

          (structure)
              Use event selectors to further specify the management  and  data
              event  settings for your trail. By default, trails created with-
              out specific event selectors will be configured to log all  read
              and  write  management events, and no data events. When an event
              occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event  selector
              for  all  trails. For each trail, if the event matches any event
              selector, the trail processes and logs the event. If  the  event
              doesn't  match  any  event  selector,  the trail doesn't log the
              event.

              You can configure up to five event selectors for a trail.

              You cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event  selec-
              tors to a trail.

              ReadWriteType -> (string)
                 Specify  if  you  want  your  trail  to log read-only events,
                 write-only events, or all. For example, the  EC2  GetConsole-
                 Output  is  a  read-only  API operation and RunInstances is a
                 write-only API operation.

                 By default, the value is All .

              IncludeManagementEvents -> (boolean)
                 Specify if you want your event selector to include management
                 events for your trail.

                 For more information, see Management Events in the CloudTrail
                 User Guide .

                 By default, the value is true .

                 The first copy of management events is free. You are  charged
                 for  additional copies of management events that you are log-
                 ging on any subsequent trail in the  same  region.  For  more
                 information  about CloudTrail pricing, see CloudTrail Pricing
                 .

              DataResources -> (list)
                 CloudTrail supports data event logging for Amazon S3 objects,
                 Lambda functions, and Amazon DynamoDB tables with basic event
                 selectors. You can specify up to 250 resources for  an  indi-
                 vidual event selector, but the total number of data resources
                 cannot exceed 250 across all event selectors in a trail. This
                 limit  does  not  apply if you configure resource logging for
                 all data events.

                 For more information, see Data Events and  Limits  in  Cloud-
                 Trail in the CloudTrail User Guide .

                 (structure)
                     The  Amazon  S3  buckets,  Lambda  functions,  or  Amazon
                     DynamoDB tables that you specify in your event  selectors
                     for  your  trail  to log data events. Data events provide
                     information about the resource operations performed on or
                     within  a  resource  itself. These are also known as data
                     plane  operations.  You  can  specify  up  to  250   data
                     resources for a trail.

                     NOTE:
                        The  total  number  of  allowed data resources is 250.
                        This number can be distributed between 1 and  5  event
                        selectors,  but the total cannot exceed 250 across all
                        selectors.

                        If you are using advanced event selectors, the maximum
                        total  number of values for all conditions, across all
                        advanced event selectors for the trail, is 500.

                     The following example demonstrates how logging works when
                     you configure logging of all data events for an S3 bucket
                     named bucket-1 . In this  example,  the  CloudTrail  user
                     specified  an  empty  prefix,  and the option to log both
                     Read and Write data events.

                     o A user uploads an image file to bucket-1 .

                     o The  PutObject  API   operation   is   an   Amazon   S3
                       object-level  API.  It  is  recorded as a data event in
                       CloudTrail. Because the CloudTrail user specified an S3
                       bucket  with  an empty prefix, events that occur on any
                       object in that bucket are logged. The  trail  processes
                       and logs the event.

                     o A  user  uploads an object to an Amazon S3 bucket named
                       arn:aws:s3:::bucket-2 .

                     o The PutObject API operation occurred for an  object  in
                       an  S3  bucket  that the CloudTrail user didn't specify
                       for the trail. The trail doesnt log the event.

                     The following example demonstrates how logging works when
                     you  configure logging of Lambda data events for a Lambda
                     function named MyLambdaFunction , but not for all  Lambda
                     functions.

                     o A  user  runs  a  script  that  includes  a call to the
                       MyLambdaFunction function and the MyOtherLambdaFunction
                       function.

                     o The  Invoke  API  operation  on  MyLambdaFunction is an
                       Lambda API. It is recorded as a data  event  in  Cloud-
                       Trail.  Because  the  CloudTrail user specified logging
                       data events for MyLambdaFunction , any  invocations  of
                       that  function are logged. The trail processes and logs
                       the event.

                     o The Invoke API operation on MyOtherLambdaFunction is an
                       Lambda API. Because the CloudTrail user did not specify
                       logging data  events  for  all  Lambda  functions,  the
                       Invoke  operation  for  MyOtherLambdaFunction  does not
                       match the function specified for the trail.  The  trail
                       doesnt log the event.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The  resource  type  in  which  you  want  to log data
                        events. You can  specify  the  following  basic  event
                        selector resource types:

                        o AWS::S3::Object

                        o AWS::Lambda::Function

                        o AWS::DynamoDB::Table

                        The following resource types are also availble through
                        advanced  event  selectors.   Basic   event   selector
                        resource  types are valid in advanced event selectors,
                        but advanced event selector  resource  types  are  not
                        valid  in basic event selectors. For more information,
                        see  AdvancedFieldSelector$Field .

                        o AWS::S3Outposts::Object

                        o AWS::ManagedBlockchain::Node

                        o AWS::S3ObjectLambda::AccessPoint

                        o AWS::EC2::Snapshot

                        o AWS::S3::AccessPoint

                        o AWS::DynamoDB::Stream

                        o AWS::Glue::Table

                     Values -> (list)
                        An array of Amazon Resource Name (ARN) strings or par-
                        tial ARN strings for the specified objects.

                        o To log data events for all objects in all S3 buckets
                          in your Amazon Web  Services  account,  specify  the
                          prefix as arn:aws:s3::: .

                        NOTE:
                            This  also  enables logging of data event activity
                            performed by any user or role in your  Amazon  Web
                            Services  account,  even  if that activity is per-
                            formed on a bucket that belongs to another  Amazon
                            Web Services account.

                        o To  log data events for all objects in an S3 bucket,
                          specify the bucket and an empty object  prefix  such
                          as  arn:aws:s3:::bucket-1/  .  The  trail  logs data
                          events for all objects in this S3 bucket.

                        o To log data events for specific objects, specify the
                          S3    bucket    and    object    prefix    such   as
                          arn:aws:s3:::bucket-1/example-images  .  The   trail
                          logs  data events for objects in this S3 bucket that
                          match the prefix.

                        o To log data events for all Lambda functions in  your
                          Amazon  Web  Services account, specify the prefix as
                          arn:aws:lambda .

                        NOTE:
                            This also enables logging of Invoke activity  per-
                            formed by any user or role in your Amazon Web Ser-
                            vices account, even if that activity is  performed
                            on  a  function that belongs to another Amazon Web
                            Services account.

                        o To log data events for a specific  Lambda  function,
                          specify the function ARN.

                        NOTE:
                            Lambda  function  ARNs  are exact. For example, if
                            you       specify       a       function       ARN
                            arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:func-
                            tion:helloworld , data events will only be  logged
                            for    arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:func-
                            tion:helloworld . They  will  not  be  logged  for
                            arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:func-
                            tion:helloworld2 .

                        o To log data events for all DynamoDB tables  in  your
                          Amazon  Web  Services account, specify the prefix as
                          arn:aws:dynamodb .

                        (string)

              ExcludeManagementEventSources -> (list)
                 An optional list of service event sources from which  you  do
                 not  want  management  events  to be logged on your trail. In
                 this release, the list can be empty (disables the filter), or
                 it  can  filter out Key Management Service or Amazon RDS Data
                 API events by containing kms.amazonaws.com or rdsdata.amazon-
                 aws.com . By default, ExcludeManagementEventSources is empty,
                 and KMS and Amazon RDS Data API events  are  logged  to  your
                 trail.  You  can  exclude  management  event  sources only in
                 regions that support the event source.

                 (string)

       AdvancedEventSelectors -> (list)
          Specifies the advanced event selectors configured for your trail.

          (structure)
              Advanced event selectors let you create  fine-grained  selectors
              for  the  following  CloudTrail event record elds. They help you
              control costs by logging only those events that are important to
              you.  For  more  information about advanced event selectors, see
              Logging data events for trails in the CloudTrail User Guide .

              o readOnly

              o eventSource

              o eventName

              o eventCategory

              o resources.type

              o resources.ARN

              You cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event  selec-
              tors to a trail.

              Name -> (string)
                 An optional, descriptive name for an advanced event selector,
                 such as "Log data events for only two S3 buckets".

              FieldSelectors -> (list)
                 Contains all selector statements in an advanced event  selec-
                 tor.

                 (structure)
                     A  single  selector statement in an advanced event selec-
                     tor.

                     Field -> (string)
                        A field in an event record on which to  filter  events
                        to  be  logged.  Supported  fields  include readOnly ,
                        eventCategory , eventSource (for  management  events),
                        eventName , resources.type , and resources.ARN .

                        o
                          **
                          readOnly ** - Optional. Can be set to Equals a value
                          of true or false . If you do  not  add  this  field,
                          CloudTrail  logs  both both read and write events. A
                          value of true logs only  read  events.  A  value  of
                          false logs only write events.

                        o
                          **
                          eventSource  **  -  For  filtering management events
                          only. This can be set only to NotEquals  kms.amazon-
                          aws.com .

                        o
                          **
                          eventName  ** - Can use any operator. You can use it
                          to lter in or lter out  any  data  event  logged  to
                          CloudTrail,  such as PutBucket or GetSnapshotBlock .
                          You can have multiple values for this eld, separated
                          by commas.

                        o
                          **
                          eventCategory  ** - This is required. It must be set
                          to Equals , and the value must be Management or Data
                          .

                        o
                          **
                          resources.type   **   -   This   eld   is  required.
                          resources.type can only use the Equals operator, and
                          the value can be one of the following:

                          o AWS::S3::Object

                          o AWS::Lambda::Function

                          o AWS::DynamoDB::Table

                          o AWS::S3Outposts::Object

                          o AWS::ManagedBlockchain::Node

                          o AWS::S3ObjectLambda::AccessPoint

                          o AWS::EC2::Snapshot

                          o AWS::S3::AccessPoint

                          o AWS::DynamoDB::Stream

                          o AWS::Glue::Table

                        You can have only one resources.type eld per selector.
                        To log data events on more than one resource type, add

                          **
                          resources.ARN  **  -  You  can use any operator with
                          resources.ARN , but if you use Equals or NotEquals ,
                          the  value  must  exactly  match  the ARN of a valid
                          resource of the type you've specied in the  template
                          as  the  value  of  resources.type.  For example, if
                          resources.type equals AWS::S3::Object , the ARN must
                          be  in one of the following formats. To log all data
                          events for all objects in a specific S3 bucket,  use
                          the StartsWith operator, and include only the bucket
                          ARN as the matching value.  The  trailing  slash  is
                          intentional;  do  not  exclude  it. Replace the text
                          between less than and greater than symbols (<>) with
                          resource-specific information.

                          o arn:<partition>:s3:::<bucket_name>/

                          o arn:<partition>:s3:::<bucket_name>/<object_path>/

                        When  resources.type equals AWS::S3::AccessPoint , and
                        the operator is set to Equals or NotEquals ,  the  ARN
                        must be in one of the following formats. To log events
                        on all objects in an S3  access  point,  we  recommend
                        that  you  use only the access point ARN, dont include
                        the object  path,  and  use  the  StartsWith  or  Not-
                        StartsWith operators.
