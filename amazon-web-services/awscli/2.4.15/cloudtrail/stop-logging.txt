STOP-LOGGING()                                                  STOP-LOGGING()



NAME
       stop-logging -

DESCRIPTION
       Suspends  the  recording  of Amazon Web Services API calls and log file
       delivery for the specified trail. Under most circumstances, there is no
       need  to  use  this  action. You can update a trail without stopping it
       first. This action is the only way  to  stop  recording.  For  a  trail
       enabled  in  all regions, this operation must be called from the region
       in which the trail was created, or an  InvalidHomeRegionException  will
       occur. This operation cannot be called on the shadow trails (replicated
       trails in other regions) of a trail enabled in all regions.

SYNOPSIS
            stop-logging
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          Specifies the name or the CloudTrail ARN  of  the  trail  for  which
          CloudTrail will stop logging Amazon Web Services API calls. The fol-
          lowing is the format of a trail ARN.
              arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       The following stop-logging command turns off logging for Trail1:

          aws cloudtrail stop-logging --name Trail1

OUTPUT

                                                                STOP-LOGGING()
