NAME
       describe-trails -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  settings  for one or more trails associated with the current
       region for your account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-trails
          [--trail-name-list <value>]
          [--include-shadow-trails | --no-include-shadow-trails]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --trail-name-list (list)
          Specifies a list of trail names, trail ARNs, or both, of the  trails
          to describe. The format of a trail ARN is:
              arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail

          If an empty list is specified, information for the trail in the cur-
          rent region is returned.

          o If an empty list is specified and  IncludeShadowTrails  is  false,
            then information for all trails in the current region is returned.

          o If an empty list is specified and IncludeShadowTrails is  null  or
            true,  then  information  for all trails in the current region and
            any associated shadow trails in other regions is returned.

          NOTE:
              If one  or  more  trail  names  are  specified,  information  is
              returned  only  if the names match the names of trails belonging
              only to the current region. To return information about a  trail
              in another region, you must specify its trail ARN.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --include-shadow-trails | --no-include-shadow-trails (boolean)
          Specifies whether to include shadow trails in the response. A shadow
          trail is the replication in a region of a trail that was created  in
          a  different  region,  or  in the case of an organization trail, the
          replication of an organization trail in member accounts. If  you  do
          not  include  shadow trails, organization trails in a member account
          and region replication trails will not be returned. The  default  is
          true.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe a trail

       The  following  describe-trails command returns the settings for Trail1
       and Trail2:

          aws cloudtrail describe-trails --trail-name-list Trail1 Trail2

       Output:

OUTPUT
       trailList -> (list)
          The list of trail objects. Trail objects with string values are only
          returned if values for the objects exist in a trail's configuration.
          For example, SNSTopicName  and  SNSTopicARN  are  only  returned  in
          results  if  a  trail is configured to send SNS notifications. Simi-
          larly, KMSKeyId only appears in results if a trail's log  files  are
          encrypted with KMS customer managed keys.
