NAME
       cloudtrail -

DESCRIPTION
       This  is  the  CloudTrail  API  Reference.  It provides descriptions of
       actions, data types, common parameters, and common  errors  for  Cloud-
       Trail.

       CloudTrail  is a web service that records Amazon Web Services API calls
       for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers log files to an  Ama-
       zon  S3  bucket.  The recorded information includes the identity of the
       user, the start time of the Amazon Web Services API call, the source IP
       address,  the request parameters, and the response elements returned by
       the service.

       NOTE:
          As an alternative to the API, you can use one of the Amazon Web Ser-
          vices  SDKs,  which consist of libraries and sample code for various
          programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android,
          etc.). The SDKs provide programmatic access to CloudTrail. For exam-
          ple, the SDKs handle cryptographically  signing  requests,  managing
          errors,  and  retrying  requests automatically. For more information
          about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how  to  download  and
          install them, see Tools to Build on Amazon Web Services .

       See  the  CloudTrail  User Guide for information about the data that is
       included with each Amazon Web Services  API  call  listed  in  the  log
       files.
