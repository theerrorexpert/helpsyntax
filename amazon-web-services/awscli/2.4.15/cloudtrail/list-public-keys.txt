LIST-PUBLIC-KEYS()                                          LIST-PUBLIC-KEYS()



NAME
       list-public-keys -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns all public keys whose private keys were used to sign the digest
       files within the specified time range. The public key is needed to val-
       idate digest files that were signed with its corresponding private key.

       NOTE:
          CloudTrail uses different private and public key pairs  per  region.
          Each  digest file is signed with a private key unique to its region.
          When you validate a digest file from a  specific  region,  you  must
          look in the same region for its corresponding public key.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-public-keys  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: PublicKeyList

SYNOPSIS
            list-public-keys
          [--start-time <value>]
          [--end-time <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --start-time (timestamp)
          Optionally specifies, in UTC, the start of the time range to look up
          public  keys for CloudTrail digest files. If not specified, the cur-
          rent time is used, and the current public key is returned.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          Optionally specifies, in UTC, the end of the time range to  look  up
          public  keys for CloudTrail digest files. If not specified, the cur-
          rent time is used.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list all public keys for a trail

       The following list-public-keys command returns all  public  keys  whose
       private  keys  were  used to sign the digest files within the specified
       time range:

          aws cloudtrail list-public-keys --start-time 2016-01-01T20:30:00.000Z

       Output:

          {
            "PublicKeyList": [
                {
                   "ValidityStartTime": 1453076702.0,
                   "ValidityEndTime": 1455668702.0,
                   "Value": "MIIBCgKCAQEAlSS3cl92HDycr/MTj0moOhas8habjrraXw+KzlWF0axSI2tcF+3iJ9BKQAVSKxGwxwu3m0wG3J+kUl1xboEcEPHYoIYMbgfSw7KGnuDKwkLzsQWhUJ0cIbOHASox1vv/5fNXkrHhGbDCHeVXm804c83nvHUEFYThr1PfyP/8HwrCtR3FX5OANtQCP61C1nJtSSkC8JSQUOrIP4CuwJjc+4WGDk+BGH5m9iuiAKkipEHWmUl8/P7XpfpWQuk4h8g3pXZOrNXr08lbh4d39svj7UqdhvOXoBISp9t/EXYuePGEtBdrKD9Dz+VHwyUPtBQvYr9BnkF88qBnaPNhS44rzwIDAQAB",
                   "Fingerprint": "7f3f401420072e50a65a141430817ab3"
               }
            ]
          }

OUTPUT
       PublicKeyList -> (list)
          Contains an array of PublicKey objects.

          NOTE:
              The returned public keys may  have  validity  time  ranges  that
              overlap.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a returned public key.

              Value -> (blob)
                 The DER encoded public key value in PKCS#1 format.

              ValidityStartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The starting time of validity of the public key.

              ValidityEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The ending time of validity of the public key.

              Fingerprint -> (string)
                 The fingerprint of the public key.

       NextToken -> (string)
          Reserved for future use.
