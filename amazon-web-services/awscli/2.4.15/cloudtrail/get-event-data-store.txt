GET-EVENT-DATA-STORE()                                  GET-EVENT-DATA-STORE()



NAME
       get-event-data-store -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  an event data store specified as either an
       ARN or the ID portion of the ARN.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-event-data-store
          --event-data-store <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --event-data-store (string)
          The ARN (or ID suffix of the ARN) of  the  event  data  store  about
          which you want information.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EventDataStoreArn -> (string)
          The event data store Amazon Resource Number (ARN).

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the event data store.

       Status -> (string)
          The  status  of an event data store. Values can be ENABLED and PEND-
          ING_DELETION .

       AdvancedEventSelectors -> (list)
          The advanced event selectors used to  select  events  for  the  data
          store.

          (structure)
              Advanced  event  selectors let you create fine-grained selectors
              for the following CloudTrail event record elds.  They  help  you
              control costs by logging only those events that are important to
              you. For more information about advanced  event  selectors,  see
              Logging data events for trails in the CloudTrail User Guide .

              o readOnly

              o eventSource

              o eventName

              o eventCategory

              o resources.type

              o resources.ARN

              You  cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event selec-
              tors to a trail.

              Name -> (string)
                 An optional, descriptive name for an advanced event selector,
                 such as "Log data events for only two S3 buckets".

              FieldSelectors -> (list)
                 Contains  all selector statements in an advanced event selec-
                 tor.

                 (structure)
                     A single selector statement in an advanced  event  selec-
                     tor.

                     Field -> (string)
                        A  field  in an event record on which to filter events
                        to be logged.  Supported  fields  include  readOnly  ,
                        eventCategory  ,  eventSource (for management events),
                        eventName , resources.type , and resources.ARN .

                        o
                          **
                          readOnly ** - Optional. Can be set to Equals a value
                          of  true  or  false  . If you do not add this field,
                          CloudTrail logs both both read and write  events.  A
                          value  of  true  logs  only  read events. A value of
                          false logs only write events.

                        o
                          **
                          eventSource ** -  For  filtering  management  events
                          only. This can be set only to NotEquals  kms.amazon-
                          aws.com .

                        o
                          **
                          eventName ** - Can use any operator. You can use  it
                          to  lter  in  or  lter  out any data event logged to
                          CloudTrail, such as PutBucket or GetSnapshotBlock  .
                          You can have multiple values for this eld, separated
                          by commas.

                        o
                          **
                          eventCategory ** - This is required. It must be  set
                          to Equals , and the value must be Management or Data
                          .

                        o
                          **
                          resources.type  **   -   This   eld   is   required.
                          resources.type can only use the Equals operator, and
                          the value can be one of the following:

                          o AWS::S3::Object

                          o AWS::Lambda::Function

                          o AWS::DynamoDB::Table

                          o AWS::S3Outposts::Object

                          o AWS::ManagedBlockchain::Node

                          o AWS::S3ObjectLambda::AccessPoint

                          o AWS::EC2::Snapshot

                          o AWS::S3::AccessPoint

                          o AWS::DynamoDB::Stream

                          o AWS::Glue::Table

                        You can have only one resources.type eld per selector.
                        To log data events on more than one resource type, add
                        another selector.

                        o
                          **
                          resources.ARN ** - You can  use  any  operator  with
                          resources.ARN , but if you use Equals or NotEquals ,
                          the value must exactly match  the  ARN  of  a  valid
                          resource  of the type you've specied in the template
                          as the value  of  resources.type.  For  example,  if
                          resources.type equals AWS::S3::Object , the ARN must
                          be in one of the following formats. To log all  data
                          events  for all objects in a specific S3 bucket, use
                          the StartsWith operator, and include only the bucket
                          ARN  as  the  matching  value. The trailing slash is
                          intentional; do not exclude  it.  Replace  the  text
                          between less than and greater than symbols (<>) with
                          resource-specific information.

                          o arn:<partition>:s3:::<bucket_name>/

                          o arn:<partition>:s3:::<bucket_name>/<object_path>/

                        When resources.type equals AWS::S3::AccessPoint ,  and
                        the  operator  is set to Equals or NotEquals , the ARN
                        must be in one of the following formats. To log events
                        on  all  objects  in  an S3 access point, we recommend
                        that you use only the access point ARN,  dont  include
                        the  object  path,  and  use  the  StartsWith  or Not-
                        StartsWith operators.

                        and  the  operator is set to Equals or NotEquals , the
                        ARN must be in the following format:

                        Blockchain::Node , and the operator is set  to  Equals

                        When     resources.type     equals      AWS::S3Object-
                        Lambda::AccessPoint  ,  and  the  operator  is  set to
                        Equals or NotEquals , the ARN must be in the following

                        When  resources.type  equals  AWS::EC2::Snapshot , and

                        of  Field  .  This is the only valid operator that you
                        can use  with  the  readOnly  ,  eventCategory  ,  and
