VALIDATE-LOGS()                                                VALIDATE-LOGS()



NAME
       validate-logs -

DESCRIPTION
          Validates CloudTrail logs for a given period of time.

          This  command  uses  the digest files delivered to your S3 bucket to
          perform the validation.

          The AWS CLI allows you to detect the following types of changes:

          o Modification or deletion of CloudTrail log files.

          o Modification or deletion of CloudTrail digest files.

          To validate log files with the AWS CLI, the following  preconditions
          must be met:

          o You must have online connectivity to AWS.

          o You  must  have  read  access  to  the S3 bucket that contains the
            digest and log files.

          o The digest and log files must not have been moved from the  origi-
            nal S3 location where CloudTrail delivered them.

          o For organization trails you must have access to describe-organiza-
            tion to validate digest files

          When you disable Log File Validation, the chain of digest  files  is
          broken  after  one  hour.  CloudTrail will not digest log files that
          were delivered during a period in which the Log File Validation fea-
          ture  was  disabled.  For example, if you enable Log File Validation
          on January 1, disable it on January 2, and re-enable it  on  January
          10,  digest  files  will  not be created for the log files delivered
          from January 3 to January 9. The  same  applies  whenever  you  stop
          CloudTrail logging or delete a trail.

          NOTE:
              Log files that have been downloaded to local disk cannot be val-
              idated with the AWS CLI. The CLI will  download  all  log  files
              each time this command is executed.

          NOTE:
              This  command  requires  that the role executing the command has
              permission to call ListObjects, GetObject, and GetBucketLocation
              for each bucket referenced by the trail.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            validate-logs
          --trail-arn <value>
          --start-time <value>
          [--end-time <value>]
          [--s3-bucket <value>]
          [--s3-prefix <value>]
          [--account-id <value>]
          [--verbose]

OPTIONS
       --trail-arn (string) Specifies the ARN of the trail to be validated

       --start-time  (string)  Specifies  that log files delivered on or after
       the  specified  UTC  timestamp  value  will  be   validated.   Example:
       "2015-01-08T05:21:42Z".

       --end-time (string) Optionally specifies that log files delivered on or
       before the specified UTC timestamp value will be validated. The default
       value is the current time. Example: "2015-01-08T12:31:41Z".

       --s3-bucket  (string)  Optionally  specifies  the  S3  bucket where the
       digest files are stored. If a bucket name is  not  specified,  the  CLI
       will retrieve it by calling describe_trails

       --s3-prefix  (string) Optionally specifies the optional S3 prefix where
       the digest files are stored. If not specified, the CLI  will  determine
       the prefix automatically by calling describe_trails.

       --account-id  (string)  Optionally specifies the account for validating
       logs. This parameter is needed for organization trails  for  validating
       logs for specific account inside an organization

       --verbose (boolean) Display verbose log validation information

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To validate a log file

       The following validate-logs command validates the logs for Trail1:

          aws cloudtrail validate-logs --trail-arn arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-1:123456789012:trail/Trail1 --start-time 20160129T19:00:00Z

       Output:

          Validating log files for trail arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-1:123456789012:trail/Trail1 between 2016-01-29T19:00:00Z and 2016-01-29T22:15:43Z
          Results requested for 2016-01-29T19:00:00Z to 2016-01-29T22:15:43Z
          Results found for 2016-01-29T19:24:57Z to 2016-01-29T21:24:57Z:
          3/3 digest files valid
          15/15 log files valid



                                                               VALIDATE-LOGS()
