UPDATE-TRAIL()                                                  UPDATE-TRAIL()



NAME
       update-trail -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  trail  settings  that control what events you are logging, and
       how to handle log files. Changes to a trail do not require stopping the
       CloudTrail service. Use this action to designate an existing bucket for
       log delivery. If the existing bucket has previously been a  target  for
       CloudTrail  log files, an IAM policy exists for the bucket. UpdateTrail
       must be called from the region in which the trail was  created;  other-
       wise, an InvalidHomeRegionException is thrown.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          Specifies  the  name  of  the trail or trail ARN. If Name is a trail
          name, the string must meet the following requirements:

          o Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), periods (.),
            underscores (_), or dashes (-)

          o Start with a letter or number, and end with a letter or number

          o Be between 3 and 128 characters

          o Have  no  adjacent  periods,  underscores  or  dashes.  Names like
            my-_namespace and my--namespace are not valid.

          o Not be in IP address format (for example, 192.168.5.4)

          If Name is a trail ARN, it must be in the following format.
              arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail

       --s3-bucket-name (string)
          Specifies the name of the Amazon S3 bucket designated for publishing
          log files. See Amazon S3 Bucket Naming Requirements .

       --s3-key-prefix (string)
          Specifies  the Amazon S3 key prefix that comes after the name of the
          bucket you have designated for log file delivery. For more  informa-
          tion,  see Finding Your CloudTrail Log Files . The maximum length is
          200 characters.

       --sns-topic-name (string)
          Specifies the name of the Amazon SNS topic defined for  notification
          of log file delivery. The maximum length is 256 characters.

       --include-global-service-events   |  --no-include-global-service-events
       (boolean)
          Specifies whether the trail is publishing events  from  global  ser-
          vices such as IAM to the log files.

       --is-multi-region-trail | --no-is-multi-region-trail (boolean)
          Specifies whether the trail applies only to the current region or to
          all regions. The default is false. If the trail exists only  in  the
          current  region and this value is set to true, shadow trails (repli-
          cations of the trail) will be created in the other regions.  If  the
          trail  exists  in  all  regions  and this value is set to false, the
          trail will remain in the region where it was created, and its shadow
          trails  in  other  regions will be deleted. As a best practice, con-
          sider using trails that log events in all regions.

       --enable-log-file-validation     |      --no-enable-log-file-validation
       (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  log  file  validation is enabled. The default is
          false.

          NOTE:
              When you disable log file integrity  validation,  the  chain  of
              digest  files is broken after one hour. CloudTrail does not cre-
              ate digest files for log files  that  were  delivered  during  a
              period  in which log file integrity validation was disabled. For
              example, if you enable log file integrity validation at noon  on
              January  1, disable it at noon on January 2, and re-enable it at
              noon on January 10, digest files will not be created for the log
              files  delivered  from  noon on January 2 to noon on January 10.
              The same applies whenever you stop CloudTrail logging or  delete
              a trail.

       --cloud-watch-logs-log-group-arn (string)
          Specifies  a  log  group name using an Amazon Resource Name (ARN), a
          unique identifier that represents the log group to which  CloudTrail
          logs   are   delivered.  Not  required  unless  you  specify  Cloud-
          WatchLogsRoleArn .

       --cloud-watch-logs-role-arn (string)
          Specifies the role for the CloudWatch Logs  endpoint  to  assume  to
          write to a user's log group.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          Specifies  the  KMS  key  ID to use to encrypt the logs delivered by
          CloudTrail. The value can be an alias name prefixed by  "alias/",  a
          fully  specified ARN to an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or
          a globally unique identifier.

          CloudTrail also supports KMS multi-Region keys. For more information
          about multi-Region keys, see Using multi-Region keys in the Key Man-
          agement Service Developer Guide .

          Examples:

          o alias/MyAliasName

          o arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName

          o arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

          o 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

       --is-organization-trail | --no-is-organization-trail (boolean)
          Specifies whether the trail is applied to all accounts in an organi-
          zation in Organizations, or only for the current Amazon Web Services
          account. The default is false, and cannot be true unless the call is
          made on behalf of an Amazon Web Services account that is the manage-
          ment  account  for an organization in Organizations. If the trail is
          not an organization trail and this is set to true , the  trail  will
          be  created  in  all Amazon Web Services accounts that belong to the
          organization. If the trail is an organization trail and this is  set
          to  false , the trail will remain in the current Amazon Web Services
          account but be deleted from all member accounts in the organization.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
