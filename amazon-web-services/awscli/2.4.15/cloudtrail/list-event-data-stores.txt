LIST-EVENT-DATA-STORES()                              LIST-EVENT-DATA-STORES()



NAME
       list-event-data-stores -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about all event data stores in the account, in the
       current region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-event-data-stores
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          A token you can use to  get  the  next  page  of  event  data  store
          results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of event data stores to display on a single page.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EventDataStores -> (list)
          Contains information about event data stores in the account, in  the
          current region.

          (structure)
              A  storage  lake of event data against which you can run complex
              SQL-based queries. An event data store can include  events  that
              you  have  logged  on your account from the last 90 to 2555 days
              (about three months to up to seven years). To select events  for
              an event data store, use advanced event selectors .

              EventDataStoreArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the event data store.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the event data store.

              TerminationProtectionEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the event data store is protected from ter-
                 mination.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of an event data store.  Values  are  ENABLED  and
                 PENDING_DELETION .

              AdvancedEventSelectors -> (list)
                 The  advanced event selectors that were used to select events
                 for the data store.

                 (structure)
                     Advanced event  selectors  let  you  create  fine-grained
                     selectors for the following CloudTrail event record elds.
                     They help you control costs by logging only those  events
                     that  are  important  to  you. For more information about
                     advanced event selectors, see  Logging  data  events  for
                     trails in the CloudTrail User Guide .

                     o resources.ARN

                     You  cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event
                     selectors to a trail.

                     Name -> (string)
                        An optional, descriptive name for  an  advanced  event
                        selector,  such  as  "Log  data events for only two S3
                        buckets".

                     FieldSelectors -> (list)
                        Contains all selector statements in an advanced  event
                        selector.

                        (structure)
                            A  single  selector statement in an advanced event
                            selector.

                            Field -> (string)
                               A field in an event record on which  to  filter
                               events  to  be logged. Supported fields include
                               readOnly ,  eventCategory  ,  eventSource  (for
                               management  events), eventName , resources.type
                               , and resources.ARN .

                               o
                                 **
                                 readOnly ** - Optional. Can be set to  Equals
                                 a  value of true or false . If you do not add
                                 this field, CloudTrail logs  both  both  read
                                 and  write  events. A value of true logs only
                                 read events. A value of false logs only write
                                 events.

                               o

                                 events only. This can be set  only  to  NotE-
                                 quals  kms.amazonaws.com .

                               o

                                 eventName  ** - Can use any operator. You can
                                 use it to lter in or lter out any data  event
                                 logged  to  CloudTrail,  such as PutBucket or
                                 GetSnapshotBlock . You can have multiple val-
                                 ues for this eld, separated by commas.

                               o
                                 **
                                 eventCategory  ** - This is required. It must
                                 be set to Equals , and the value must be Man-
                                 agement or Data .

                               o
                                 **
                                 resources.type  **  -  This  eld is required.
                                 resources.type can only use the Equals opera-
                                 tor,  and the value can be one of the follow-
                                 ing:

                                 o AWS::S3::Object

                                 o AWS::Lambda::Function

                                 o AWS::DynamoDB::Table

                                 o AWS::S3Outposts::Object

                                 o AWS::ManagedBlockchain::Node

                                 o AWS::S3ObjectLambda::AccessPoint

                                 o AWS::EC2::Snapshot

                                 o AWS::S3::AccessPoint

                                 o AWS::DynamoDB::Stream

                                 o AWS::Glue::Table

                               You can have only one  resources.type  eld  per
                               selector.  To  log data events on more than one
                               resource type, add another selector.

                               o
                                 **
                                 resources.ARN ** - You can use  any  operator
                                 with resources.ARN , but if you use Equals or
                                 NotEquals , the value must exactly match  the
                                 ARN  of  a  valid resource of the type you've
                                 specied in  the  template  as  the  value  of
                                 resources.type.      For      example,     if
                                 resources.type equals AWS::S3::Object  ,  the
                                 ARN  must be in one of the following formats.
                                 To log all data events for all objects  in  a
                                 specific S3 bucket, use the StartsWith opera-
                                 tor, and include only the bucket ARN  as  the
                                 matching  value. The trailing slash is inten-
                                 tional; do not exclude it. Replace  the  text
                                 between  less  than  and greater than symbols
                                 (<>) with resource-specific information.

                               quals , the ARN must be in one of the following
                               formats. To log events on all objects in an  S3
                               access  point,  we  recommend that you use only
                               the access point ARN, dont include  the  object
                               path,  and  use the StartsWith or NotStartsWith
                               operators.
