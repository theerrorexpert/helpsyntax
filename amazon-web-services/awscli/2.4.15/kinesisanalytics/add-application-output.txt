ADD-APPLICATION-OUTPUT()                              ADD-APPLICATION-OUTPUT()



NAME
       add-application-output -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This  documentation is for version 1 of the Amazon Kinesis Data Ana-
          lytics API, which only supports SQL applications. Version 2  of  the
          API  supports  SQL and Java applications. For more information about
          version 2, see Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics API V2 Documentation  .

       Adds  an external destination to your Amazon Kinesis Analytics applica-
       tion.

       If you want Amazon Kinesis Analytics to deliver data from an  in-appli-
       cation  stream within your application to an external destination (such
       as an Amazon  Kinesis  stream,  an  Amazon  Kinesis  Firehose  delivery
       stream,  or an AWS Lambda function), you add the relevant configuration
       to your application using this operation. You can configure one or more
       outputs  for  your  application.  Each  output  configuration  maps  an
       in-application stream and an external destination.

       You can use one of the output configurations to deliver data from  your
       in-application  error stream to an external destination so that you can
       analyze the errors. For more information, see Understanding Application
       Output (Destination) .

       Any  configuration  update,  including  adding a streaming source using
       this operation, results in a new version of the  application.  You  can
       use  the  DescribeApplication operation to find the current application
       version.

       For the limits on the number of application inputs and outputs you  can
       configure, see Limits .

       This  operation  requires  permissions  to  perform  the kinesisanalyt-
       ics:AddApplicationOutput action.

SYNOPSIS
            add-application-output
          --application-name <value>
          --current-application-version-id <value>
          --application-output <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          Name of the application to which you want to add the output configu-
          ration.

       --current-application-version-id (long)
          Version  of the application to which you want to add the output con-
          figuration. You can use the DescribeApplication operation to get the
          current  application  version.  If  the version specified is not the
          current version, the ConcurrentModificationException is returned.

       --application-output (structure)
          An array of objects, each describing one  output  configuration.  In
          the  output configuration, you specify the name of an in-application
          stream, a destination (that is, an Amazon Kinesis stream, an  Amazon
          Kinesis  Firehose  delivery  stream, or an AWS Lambda function), and
          record the formation to use when writing to the destination.

          Name -> (string)
              Name of the in-application stream.

          KinesisStreamsOutput -> (structure)
              Identifies an Amazon Kinesis stream as the destination.

              ResourceARN -> (string)
                 ARN of the destination Amazon Kinesis stream to write to.

              RoleARN -> (string)
                 ARN of the IAM role that Amazon Kinesis Analytics can  assume
                 to  write  to the destination stream on your behalf. You need
                 to grant the necessary permissions to this role.

          KinesisFirehoseOutput -> (structure)
              Identifies an Amazon Kinesis Firehose  delivery  stream  as  the
              destination.

              ResourceARN -> (string)
                 ARN  of  the  destination  Amazon  Kinesis  Firehose delivery
                 stream to write to.

              RoleARN -> (string)
                 ARN of the IAM role that Amazon Kinesis Analytics can  assume
                 to  write  to the destination stream on your behalf. You need
                 to grant the necessary permissions to this role.

          LambdaOutput -> (structure)
              Identifies an AWS Lambda function as the destination.

              ResourceARN -> (string)
                 Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the destination Lambda function
                 to write to.

                 NOTE:
                     To specify an earlier version of the Lambda function than
                     the latest, include the Lambda function  version  in  the
                     Lambda  function  ARN.  For more information about Lambda
                     ARNs, see Example ARNs: AWS Lambda

              RoleARN -> (string)
                 ARN of the IAM role that Amazon Kinesis Analytics can  assume
                 to write to the destination function on your behalf. You need
                 to grant the necessary permissions to this role.

          DestinationSchema -> (structure)
              Describes the data format when records are written to the desti-
              nation. For more information, see Configuring Application Output
              .

              RecordFormatType -> (string)
                 Specifies the format of the records on the output stream.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,KinesisStreamsOutput={ResourceARN=string,RoleARN=string},KinesisFirehoseOutput={ResourceARN=string,RoleARN=string},LambdaOutput={ResourceARN=string,RoleARN=string},DestinationSchema={RecordFormatType=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Name": "string",
            "KinesisStreamsOutput": {
              "ResourceARN": "string",
              "RoleARN": "string"
            },
            "KinesisFirehoseOutput": {
              "ResourceARN": "string",
              "RoleARN": "string"
            },
            "LambdaOutput": {
              "ResourceARN": "string",
              "RoleARN": "string"
            },
            "DestinationSchema": {
              "RecordFormatType": "JSON"|"CSV"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
