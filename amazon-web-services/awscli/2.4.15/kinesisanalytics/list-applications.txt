NAME
       list-applications -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This  documentation is for version 1 of the Amazon Kinesis Data Ana-
          lytics API, which only supports SQL applications. Version 2  of  the
          API  supports  SQL and Java applications. For more information about
          version 2, see Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics API V2 Documentation  .

       Returns  a  list  of  Amazon  Kinesis  Analytics  applications  in your
       account. For each application, the response  includes  the  application
       name,  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN), and status. If the response returns
       the HasMoreApplications value as true, you can send another request  by
       adding  the  ExclusiveStartApplicationName in the request body, and set
       the value of this to  the  last  application  name  from  the  previous
       response.

       If  you  want  detailed  information  about a specific application, use
       DescribeApplication .

       This operation  requires  permissions  to  perform  the  kinesisanalyt-
       ics:ListApplications action.

SYNOPSIS
            list-applications
          [--limit <value>]
          [--exclusive-start-application-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --limit (integer)
          Maximum number of applications to list.

       --exclusive-start-application-name (string)
          Name  of  the application to start the list with. When using pagina-
          tion to retrieve the list, you don't need to specify this  parameter
          in  the  first request. However, in subsequent requests, you add the
          last application name from the previous response  to  get  the  next
          page of applications.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ApplicationSummaries -> (list)
          List of ApplicationSummary objects.

              NOTE:
                 This  documentation  is  for  version 1 of the Amazon Kinesis

                 Analytics API V2 Documentation .

              ApplicationName -> (string)
                 Name of the application.

              ApplicationARN -> (string)
                 ARN of the application.

              ApplicationStatus -> (string)
                 Status of the application.

       HasMoreApplications -> (boolean)
          Returns true if there are more applications to retrieve.
