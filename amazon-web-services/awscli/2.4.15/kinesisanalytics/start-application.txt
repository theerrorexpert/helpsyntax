NAME
       start-application -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This  documentation is for version 1 of the Amazon Kinesis Data Ana-
          lytics API, which only supports SQL applications. Version 2  of  the
          API  supports  SQL and Java applications. For more information about
          version 2, see Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics API V2 Documentation  .

       Starts the specified Amazon Kinesis Analytics application. After creat-
       ing an application, you must exclusively call this operation  to  start
       your application.

       After  the application starts, it begins consuming the input data, pro-
       cesses it, and writes the output to the configured destination.

       The application status must be READY for you to start  an  application.
       You  can  get  the  application  status  in  the  console  or using the
       DescribeApplication operation.

       After you start the application, you can stop the application from pro-
       cessing the input by calling the StopApplication operation.

       This  operation  requires  permissions  to  perform  the kinesisanalyt-
       ics:StartApplication action.

SYNOPSIS
            start-application
          --application-name <value>
          --input-configurations <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          Name of the application.

       --input-configurations (list)
          Identifies the specific input, by ID, that  the  application  starts
          consuming.  Amazon  Kinesis  Analytics  starts reading the streaming
          source associated with the input. You can also specify where in  the
          streaming source you want Amazon Kinesis Analytics to start reading.

          (structure)
              When you start your application, you provide this configuration,
              which  identifies  the  input  source and the point in the input
              source at which you want the  application  to  start  processing
              records.

              Id -> (string)
                 Input  source  ID.  You  can  get  this  ID  by  calling  the
                 DescribeApplication operation.

              InputStartingPositionConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Point at which you want the application to  start  processing
                 records from the streaming source.

                 InputStartingPosition -> (string)
                     The starting position on the stream.

                     o NOW  -  Start reading just after the most recent record
                       in the stream, start at the request time stamp that the
                       customer issued.

                     o TRIM_HORIZON  -  Start  reading  at  the last untrimmed
                       record in the stream, which is the oldest record avail-
                       able in the stream. This option is not available for an
                       Amazon Kinesis Firehose delivery stream.

                     o LAST_STOPPED_POINT -  Resume  reading  from  where  the
                       application last stopped reading.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Id=string,InputStartingPositionConfiguration={InputStartingPosition=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Id": "string",
              "InputStartingPositionConfiguration": {
                "InputStartingPosition": "NOW"|"TRIM_HORIZON"|"LAST_STOPPED_POINT"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
