DISCOVER-INPUT-SCHEMA()                                DISCOVER-INPUT-SCHEMA()



NAME
       discover-input-schema -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This  documentation is for version 1 of the Amazon Kinesis Data Ana-
          lytics API, which only supports SQL applications. Version 2  of  the
          API  supports  SQL and Java applications. For more information about
          version 2, see Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics API V2 Documentation  .

       Infers a schema by evaluating sample records on the specified streaming
       source (Amazon Kinesis  stream  or  Amazon  Kinesis  Firehose  delivery
       stream)  or  S3  object.  In  the  response,  the operation returns the
       inferred schema and also the sample records that the operation used  to
       infer the schema.

       You can use the inferred schema when configuring a streaming source for
       your application. For conceptual information, see Configuring  Applica-
       tion  Input . Note that when you create an application using the Amazon
       Kinesis Analytics console, the console uses this operation to  infer  a
       schema and show it in the console user interface.

       This  operation  requires  permissions  to  perform  the kinesisanalyt-
       ics:DiscoverInputSchema action.

          [--resource-arn <value>]
          [--role-arn <value>]
          [--input-starting-position-configuration <value>]
          [--s3-configuration <value>]
          [--input-processing-configuration <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the streaming source.

       --role-arn (string)
          ARN of the IAM role that Amazon  Kinesis  Analytics  can  assume  to
          access the stream on your behalf.

       --input-starting-position-configuration (structure)
          Point  at  which  you want Amazon Kinesis Analytics to start reading
          records from the specified streaming source discovery purposes.

          InputStartingPosition -> (string)
              The starting position on the stream.

              o NOW - Start reading just after the most recent record  in  the
                stream,  start  at  the  request  time stamp that the customer
                issued.

              o TRIM_HORIZON - Start reading at the last untrimmed  record  in
                the  stream,  which  is  the  oldest  record  available in the
                stream. This option is not available  for  an  Amazon  Kinesis
                Firehose delivery stream.

              o LAST_STOPPED_POINT - Resume reading from where the application
                last stopped reading.

          }

       --input-processing-configuration (structure)
          The  InputProcessingConfiguration  to  use to preprocess the records
          before discovering the schema of the records.

          InputLambdaProcessor -> (structure)
              The InputLambdaProcessor that is used to preprocess the  records

                 The  ARN  of the AWS Lambda function that operates on records
                 in the stream.

                 NOTE:
                     To specify an earlier version of the Lambda function than
                     the  latest,  include  the Lambda function version in the
                     Lambda function ARN. For more  information  about  Lambda

              RoleARN -> (string)
                 The ARN of the IAM role that is used to access the AWS Lambda
                 function.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          InputLambdaProcessor={ResourceARN=string,RoleARN=string}

       JSON Syntax:

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       InputSchema -> (structure)
          Schema inferred from the streaming source. It identifies the  format
          of  the  data in the streaming source and how each data element maps
          to corresponding columns in the in-application stream that  you  can
          create.

          RecordFormat -> (structure)
              Specifies the format of the records on the streaming source.

              RecordFormatType -> (string)
                 The type of record format.

              MappingParameters -> (structure)
                 When configuring application input at the time of creating or
                 updating an application, provides additional mapping informa-
                 tion  specific  to  the  record format (such as JSON, CSV, or
                 record fields delimited by some delimiter) on  the  streaming
                 source.

                 JSONMappingParameters -> (structure)
                     Provides  additional mapping information when JSON is the
                     record format on the streaming source.

                     RecordRowPath -> (string)
                        Path  to  the  top-level  parent  that  contains   the
                        records.

                 CSVMappingParameters -> (structure)
                     Provides  additional  mapping information when the record

                     RecordRowDelimiter -> (string)
                        Row delimiter. For example, in a CSV  format,  'n'  is

                     RecordColumnDelimiter -> (string)
                        Column  delimiter.  For  example,  in  a CSV format, a
                        comma (",") is the typical column delimiter.

          RecordEncoding -> (string)
              Specifies the encoding of the records in the  streaming  source.
              For example, UTF-8.

          RecordColumns -> (list)
              A list of RecordColumn objects.

              (structure)
                 Describes  the  mapping of each data element in the streaming

                 Mapping -> (string)
                     Reference  to  the data element in the streaming input or
                     the reference data source. This element  is  required  if
                     the RecordFormatType is JSON .

                 SqlType -> (string)
                     Type of column created in the in-application input stream
