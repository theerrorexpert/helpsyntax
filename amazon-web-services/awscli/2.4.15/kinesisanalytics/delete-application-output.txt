DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This  documentation is for version 1 of the Amazon Kinesis Data Ana-
          lytics API, which only supports SQL applications. Version 2  of  the
          API  supports  SQL and Java applications. For more information about
          version 2, see Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics API V2 Documentation  .

       Deletes output destination configuration from your application configu-
       ration. Amazon Kinesis Analytics will no longer  write  data  from  the
       corresponding in-application stream to the external output destination.

       This operation  requires  permissions  to  perform  the  kinesisanalyt-
       ics:DeleteApplicationOutput action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-application-output
          --application-name <value>
          --current-application-version-id <value>
          --output-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          Amazon Kinesis Analytics application name.

       --current-application-version-id (long)
          Amazon  Kinesis  Analytics  application  version.  You  can  use the
          DescribeApplication operation to get the  current  application  ver-
          sion.  If the version specified is not the current version, the Con-
          currentModificationException is returned.

       --output-id (string)
          The ID of the configuration to  delete.  Each  output  configuration
          that  is  added  to  the application, either when the application is
          created or later using the  AddApplicationOutput  operation,  has  a
          unique  ID. You need to provide the ID to uniquely identify the out-
          put configuration that you want to delete from the application  con-
          figuration. You can use the DescribeApplication operation to get the
          specific OutputId .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
