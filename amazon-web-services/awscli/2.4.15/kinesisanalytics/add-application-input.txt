ADD-APPLICATION-INPUT()                                ADD-APPLICATION-INPUT()



NAME
       add-application-input -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This  documentation is for version 1 of the Amazon Kinesis Data Ana-
          lytics API, which only supports SQL applications. Version 2  of  the
          API  supports  SQL and Java applications. For more information about
          version 2, see Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics API V2 Documentation  .

       Adds a streaming source to your Amazon Kinesis application. For concep-
       tual information, see Configuring Application Input .

       You can add a streaming source either when you create an application or
       you  can  use this operation to add a streaming source after you create
       an application. For more information, see CreateApplication .

       Any configuration update, including adding  a  streaming  source  using
       this  operation,  results  in a new version of the application. You can
       use the DescribeApplication operation to find the  current  application
       version.

       This  operation  requires  permissions  to  perform  the kinesisanalyt-
       ics:AddApplicationInput action.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            add-application-input
          --application-name <value>
          --current-application-version-id <value>
          --input <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          Name of your existing Amazon Kinesis Analytics application to  which
          you want to add the streaming source.

       --current-application-version-id (long)
          Current  version  of  your Amazon Kinesis Analytics application. You
          can use the DescribeApplication operation to find the current appli-
          cation version.

       --input (structure)
          The Input to add.

          NamePrefix -> (string)
              Name  prefix to use when creating an in-application stream. Sup-
              pose that you specify a prefix  "MyInApplicationStream."  Amazon
              Kinesis Analytics then creates one or more (as per the InputPar-
              allelism count you specified) in-application streams with  names
              "MyInApplicationStream_001," "MyInApplicationStream_002," and so
              on.

          InputProcessingConfiguration -> (structure)
              The InputProcessingConfiguration for the input. An input proces-
              sor  transforms  records  as  they are received from the stream,
              before the application's SQL code executes. Currently, the  only
              input processing configuration available is InputLambdaProcessor
              .

              InputLambdaProcessor -> (structure)
                 The InputLambdaProcessor  that  is  used  to  preprocess  the
                 records in the stream before being processed by your applica-
                 tion code.

                 ResourceARN -> (string)
                     The ARN of the  AWS  Lambda  function  that  operates  on
                     records in the stream.

                     NOTE:
                        To  specify  an earlier version of the Lambda function
                        than the latest, include the Lambda  function  version
                        in the Lambda function ARN. For more information about
                        Lambda ARNs, see Example ARNs: AWS Lambda

                 RoleARN -> (string)
                     The ARN of the IAM role that is used to  access  the  AWS
                     Lambda function.

          KinesisStreamsInput -> (structure)
              If  the streaming source is an Amazon Kinesis stream, identifies
              the stream's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and  an  IAM  role  that
              enables  Amazon  Kinesis  Analytics to access the stream on your
              behalf.

              Note:  Either  KinesisStreamsInput  or  KinesisFirehoseInput  is
              required.

              ResourceARN -> (string)
                 ARN of the input Amazon Kinesis stream to read.

              RoleARN -> (string)
                 ARN  of the IAM role that Amazon Kinesis Analytics can assume
                 to access the stream on your behalf. You need  to  grant  the
                 necessary permissions to this role.

          KinesisFirehoseInput -> (structure)
              If  the  streaming source is an Amazon Kinesis Firehose delivery
              stream, identifies the delivery stream's ARN  and  an  IAM  role
              that  enables  Amazon  Kinesis Analytics to access the stream on
              your behalf.

              Note:  Either  KinesisStreamsInput  or  KinesisFirehoseInput  is
              required.

              ResourceARN -> (string)
                 ARN of the input delivery stream.

              RoleARN -> (string)
                 ARN  of the IAM role that Amazon Kinesis Analytics can assume
                 to access the stream on your behalf. You need  to  make  sure
                 that  the  role  has  the necessary permissions to access the
                 stream.

          InputParallelism -> (structure)
              Describes the number of in-application streams to create.

              Data from your source is routed to  these  in-application  input
              streams.

          InputSchema -> (structure)
              Describes the format of the data in the  streaming  source,  and
              how  each  data  element  maps  to  corresponding columns in the
              in-application stream that is being created.

              Also used to describe the format of the reference data source.

              RecordFormat -> (structure)
                 Specifies the format of the records on the streaming  source.

                 RecordFormatType -> (string)

                     When  configuring application input at the time of creat-
                     ing or updating an application, provides additional  map-
                     ping  information  specific to the record format (such as
                     JSON, CSV, or record fields delimited by some  delimiter)
                     on the streaming source.

                     JSONMappingParameters -> (structure)
                        Provides  additional  mapping information when JSON is
                        the record format on the streaming source.

                        RecordRowPath -> (string)
                            Path to the top-level  parent  that  contains  the
                            records.

                     CSVMappingParameters -> (structure)
                        Provides   additional  mapping  information  when  the

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
