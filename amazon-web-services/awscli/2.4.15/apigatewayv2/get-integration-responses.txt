NAME
       get-integration-responses -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the IntegrationResponses for an Integration.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-integration-responses  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: Items

SYNOPSIS
            get-integration-responses
          --api-id <value>
          --integration-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --api-id (string)
          The API identifier.

       --integration-id (string)
          The integration ID.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (string)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (string)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Items -> (list)
          The elements from this collection.

          (structure)
              Represents an integration response.

              ContentHandlingStrategy -> (string)
                 Supported  only  for  WebSocket APIs. Specifies how to handle
                 response payload content type conversions.  Supported  values
                 are CONVERT_TO_BINARY and CONVERT_TO_TEXT, with the following
                 behaviors:

                 CONVERT_TO_BINARY:  Converts  a  response  payload   from   a
                 Base64-encoded string to the corresponding binary blob.

                 CONVERT_TO_TEXT:  Converts  a  response payload from a binary
                 blob to a Base64-encoded string.

                 If this property is not defined, the response payload will be
                 passed  through  from  the  integration response to the route
                 response or method response without modification.

              IntegrationResponseId -> (string)
                 The integration response ID.

              IntegrationResponseKey -> (string)
                 The integration response key.

              ResponseParameters -> (map)
                 A key-value  map  specifying  response  parameters  that  are
                 passed  to the method response from the backend. The key is a
                 method response header parameter name and the mapped value is
                 an integration response header value, a static value enclosed
                 within a pair of single quotes, or a JSON expression from the
                 integration  response  body.  The  mapping key must match the
                 pattern of method.response.header.{name},  where  name  is  a
                 valid  and  unique  header  name. The mapped non-static value
                 must match the pattern of  integration.response.header.{name}
                 or integration.response.body.{JSON-expression}, where name is
                 a valid and unique response header name  and  JSON-expression
                 is a valid JSON expression without the $ prefix.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)
                     A string with a length between [1-512].

              ResponseTemplates -> (map)
                 The  collection  of  response  templates  for the integration
                 response  as  a  string-to-string  map  of  key-value  pairs.
                 Response templates are represented as a key/value map, with a
                 content-type as the key and a template as the value.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)
                     A string with a length between [0-32768].

              TemplateSelectionExpression -> (string)
                 The  template  selection  expressions  for  the   integration
                 response.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  next  page  of elements from this collection. Not valid for the
          last element of the collection.
