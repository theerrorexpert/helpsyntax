GET-APIS()                                                          GET-APIS()



NAME
       get-apis -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a collection of Api resources.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-apis  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in
       order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagi-
       nation  by  providing  the --no-paginate argument.  When using --output
       text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: Items

SYNOPSIS
            get-apis
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (string)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (string)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Items -> (list)
          The elements from this collection.

          (structure)
              Represents an API.

              ApiEndpoint -> (string)
                 The   URI   of   the   API,   of   the   form   {api-id}.exe-
                 cute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com. The stage name is  typically
                 appended  to  this  URI to form a complete path to a deployed

              ApiGatewayManaged -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether an API is managed by API Gateway. You can't
                 update  or  delete a managed API by using API Gateway. A man-
                 aged API can be deleted only through the tooling  or  service
                 that created it.

              ApiId -> (string)
                 The API ID.

              ApiKeySelectionExpression -> (string)
                 An API key selection expression. Supported only for WebSocket
                 APIs. See API Key Selection Expressions .

              CorsConfiguration -> (structure)
                 A CORS configuration. Supported only for HTTP APIs.

                 AllowCredentials -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether credentials are included  in  the  CORS
                     request. Supported only for HTTP APIs.

                 AllowHeaders -> (list)
                     Represents  a  collection  of  allowed headers. Supported
                     only for HTTP APIs.

                     (string)

                 AllowMethods -> (list)
                     Represents a collection of  allowed  HTTP  methods.  Sup-
                     ported only for HTTP APIs.

                     (string)
                        A string with a length between [1-64].

                 AllowOrigins -> (list)
                     Represents  a  collection  of  allowed origins. Supported
                     only for HTTP APIs.

                 ExposeHeaders -> (list)
                     Represents a collection  of  exposed  headers.  Supported
                     only for HTTP APIs.

                     (string)

                 MaxAge -> (integer)
                     The  number of seconds that the browser should cache pre-
                     flight request results. Supported only for HTTP APIs.

              CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp when the API was created.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the API.

              DisableSchemaValidation -> (boolean)
                 Avoid validating models when creating a deployment. Supported
                 only for WebSocket APIs.

              DisableExecuteApiEndpoint -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether  clients  can invoke your API by using the
                 default execute-api endpoint. By default, clients can  invoke
                 your          API          with          the          default
                 https://{api_id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com endpoint.
                 To  require  that  clients use a custom domain name to invoke
                 your API, disable the default endpoint.

              ImportInfo -> (list)
                 The  validation  information  during  API  import.  This  may
                 include  particular  properties  of  your  OpenAPI definition
                 which are ignored during  import.  Supported  only  for  HTTP
                 APIs.

                 (string)

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the API.

              RouteSelectionExpression -> (string)
                 The  route  selection  expression for the API. For HTTP APIs,
                 the  routeSelectionExpression   must   be   ${request.method}
                 ${request.path}.  If  not  provided, this will be the default
                 for HTTP APIs. This property is required for WebSocket  APIs.

              Tags -> (map)
                 A collection of tags associated with the API.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)
                     A string with a length between [0-1600].

              Version -> (string)
                 A version identifier for the API.

              Warnings -> (list)
                 The  warning  messages reported when failonwarnings is turned
                 on during API import.

                 (string)
