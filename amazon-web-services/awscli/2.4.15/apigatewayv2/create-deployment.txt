CREATE-DEPLOYMENT()                                        CREATE-DEPLOYMENT()



NAME
       create-deployment -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a Deployment for an API.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-deployment
          --api-id <value>
          [--description <value>]
          [--stage-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --api-id (string)
          The API identifier.

       --description (string)
          The description for the deployment resource.

       --stage-name (string)
          The  name  of the Stage resource for the Deployment resource to cre-
          ate.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a deployment for an API

       The following create-deployment example creates a deployment for an API
       and associates that deployment with the dev stage of the API.

          aws apigatewayv2 create-deployment \
              --api-id a1b2c3d4 \
              --stage-name dev

       Output:

          {
              "AutoDeployed": false,
              "CreatedDate": "2020-04-06T23:38:08Z",
              "DeploymentId": "53lz9l",
              "DeploymentStatus": "DEPLOYED"
          }

       For  more  information,  see  API  deployment in the Amazon API Gateway
