NAME
       get-integration-response -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets an IntegrationResponses.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-integration-response
          --api-id <value>
          --integration-id <value>
          --integration-response-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --api-id (string)
          The API identifier.

       --integration-id (string)
          The integration ID.

       --integration-response-id (string)
          The integration response ID.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ContentHandlingStrategy -> (string)
          Supported  only for WebSocket APIs. Specifies how to handle response
          payload  content  type  conversions.  Supported  values   are   CON-
          VERT_TO_BINARY and CONVERT_TO_TEXT, with the following behaviors:

          CONVERT_TO_BINARY: Converts a response payload from a Base64-encoded
          string to the corresponding binary blob.

          CONVERT_TO_TEXT: Converts a response payload from a binary blob to a
          Base64-encoded string.

          If this property is not defined, the response payload will be passed
          through from the integration  response  to  the  route  response  or
          method response without modification.

       IntegrationResponseId -> (string)
          The integration response ID.

       IntegrationResponseKey -> (string)
          The integration response key.

       ResponseParameters -> (map)
          A  key-value  map  specifying response parameters that are passed to
          the method response from the backend. The key is a  method  response
          header  parameter  name  and  the  mapped  value  is  an integration
          response header value, a static value enclosed within a pair of sin-
          gle quotes, or a JSON expression from the integration response body.
          The    mapping     key     must     match     the     pattern     of
          method.response.header.{name},  where  name  is  a  valid and unique
          header name. The mapped non-static value must match the  pattern  of
          integration.response.header.{name}            or            integra-
          tion.response.body.{JSON-expression}, where  name  is  a  valid  and
          unique  response  header  name  and  JSON-expression is a valid JSON
          expression without the $ prefix.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)
              A string with a length between [1-512].

       ResponseTemplates -> (map)
          The collection of response templates for the integration response as
          a  string-to-string  map  of key-value pairs. Response templates are
          represented as a key/value map, with a content-type as the key and a
          template as the value.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)
              A string with a length between [0-32768].

       TemplateSelectionExpression -> (string)
          The template selection expressions for the integration response.
