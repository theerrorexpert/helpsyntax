GET-DOMAIN-NAMES()                                          GET-DOMAIN-NAMES()



NAME
       get-domain-names -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the domain names for an AWS account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-domain-names  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Items

SYNOPSIS
            get-domain-names
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (string)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (string)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       custom domain names for the current user.

                        it is AVAILABLE, the domain can be updated.

                        security policy for this domain name. The valid values
                        are TLS_1_0 and TLS_1_2.

                     OwnershipVerificationCertificateArn -> (string)
                        The  ARN  of  the  public certificate issued by ACM to
                        validate  ownership  of  your  custom   domain.   Only
                        required  when configuring mutual TLS and using an ACM
                        imported or private CA certificate ARN as the  region-

                     TLS          authentication,         for         example,
                     s3://bucket-name/key-name.  The  truststore  can  contain
                     certificates  from public or private certificate authori-
                     ties. To update the truststore, upload a new  version  to
                     S3,  and  then  update your custom domain name to use the
                     new version. To update the truststore, you must have per-
                     missions to access the S3 object.

                     The  version  of  the S3 object that contains your trust-
                     store. To specify a version,  you  must  have  versioning

                     A  list  of  warnings that API Gateway returns while pro-
                     cessing your  truststore.  Invalid  certificates  produce
                     warnings.  Mutual  TLS is still enabled, but some clients
                     might not be able to access your API.  To  resolve  warn-
                     ings,  upload a new truststore to S3, and then update you
                     domain name to use the new version.

                     (string)

              Tags -> (map)
                 The collection of tags associated with a domain name.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)
                     A string with a length between [0-1600].

       NextToken -> (string)
          The next page of elements from this collection. Not  valid  for  the
          last element of the collection.
