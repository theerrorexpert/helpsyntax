GET-DOMAIN-NAME()                                            GET-DOMAIN-NAME()



NAME
       get-domain-name -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a domain name.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-domain-name
          --domain-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The domain name.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve information about a custom domain name

       The following get-domain-name example displays information about a cus-
       tom domain name.

          aws apigatewayv2 get-domain-name \
              --domain-name api.example.com

       Output:

          {
              "ApiMappingSelectionExpression": "$request.basepath",
              "DomainName": "api.example.com",
              "DomainNameConfigurations": [
                  {
                      "ApiGatewayDomainName": "d-1234.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com",
                      "CertificateArn": "arn:aws:acm:us-west-2:123456789012:certificate/123456789012-1234-1234-1234-12345678",
                      "EndpointType": "REGIONAL",
                      "HostedZoneId": "123456789111",
                      "SecurityPolicy": "TLS_1_2",
                      "DomainNameStatus": "AVAILABLE"
                  }
              ],
              "Tags": {}
          }

              ApiGatewayDomainName -> (string)
                 A domain name for the API.

              CertificateArn -> (string)
                 An   AWS-managed   certificate  that  will  be  used  by  the
                 edge-optimized endpoint for this domain name. AWS Certificate
                 Manager is the only supported source.

              CertificateName -> (string)
                 The  user-friendly  name of the certificate that will be used
                 by the edge-optimized endpoint for this domain name.

              CertificateUploadDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  timestamp  when  the  certificate  that  was   used   by
                 edge-optimized endpoint for this domain name was uploaded.

              DomainNameStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the domain name migration. The valid values are
                 AVAILABLE, UPDATING, PENDING_CERTIFICATE_REIMPORT, and  PEND-
                 ING_OWNERSHIP_VERIFICATION.  If  the  status is UPDATING, the
                 domain cannot be modified further until the  existing  opera-
                 tion  is  complete.  If  it  is  AVAILABLE, the domain can be
                 updated.

              DomainNameStatusMessage -> (string)
                 An optional  text  message  containing  detailed  information

                 policy for this domain name. The valid values are TLS_1_0 and
                 TLS_1_2.

              OwnershipVerificationCertificateArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of the public certificate issued by ACM to validate
                 ownership of your custom domain. Only required when configur-
                 ing  mutual  TLS and using an ACM imported or private CA cer-
                 tificate ARN as the regionalCertificateArn

       MutualTlsAuthentication -> (structure)
          The mutual TLS authentication  configuration  for  a  custom  domain
          name.

          TruststoreUri -> (string)
              An  Amazon  S3  URL that specifies the truststore for mutual TLS
              authentication,  for  example,  s3://bucket-name/key-name.   The
              truststore  can contain certificates from public or private cer-
              tificate authorities. To update the  truststore,  upload  a  new
              version  to  S3,  and then update your custom domain name to use
              the new version. To update the truststore, you must have permis-
              sions to access the S3 object.

          TruststoreVersion -> (string)
              The  version  of the S3 object that contains your truststore. To
              specify a version, you must have versioning enabled for  the  S3
              bucket.

          TruststoreWarnings -> (list)
              A  list  of  warnings  that API Gateway returns while processing
              your truststore. Invalid certificates produce  warnings.  Mutual
              TLS  is  still  enabled,  but  some clients might not be able to
              access your API. To resolve warnings, upload a new truststore to
              S3, and then update you domain name to use the new version.

              (string)

       Tags -> (map)

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)
