GET-INTEGRATIONS()                                          GET-INTEGRATIONS()



NAME
       get-integrations -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the Integrations for an API.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-integrations  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Items

SYNOPSIS
            get-integrations
          --api-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --api-id (string)
          The API identifier.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (string)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (string)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Items -> (list)
          The elements from this collection.

          (structure)
              Represents an integration.

              ApiGatewayManaged -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether an integration is managed by  API  Gateway.
                 If you created an API using using quick create, the resulting
                 integration is managed by API Gateway. You can update a  man-
                 aged integration, but you can't delete it.

              ConnectionId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of the VPC link for a private integration. Supported
                 only for HTTP APIs.

              ConnectionType -> (string)
                 The type of the network connection to  the  integration  end-
                 point.  Specify  INTERNET  for connections through the public
                 routable internet or VPC_LINK for private connections between
                 API  Gateway  and  resources  in  a VPC. The default value is
                 INTERNET.

              ContentHandlingStrategy -> (string)
                 Supported only for WebSocket APIs. Specifies  how  to  handle
                 response  payload  content type conversions. Supported values
                 are CONVERT_TO_BINARY and CONVERT_TO_TEXT, with the following
                 behaviors:

                 CONVERT_TO_BINARY:   Converts   a  response  payload  from  a
                 Base64-encoded string to the corresponding binary blob.

                 CONVERT_TO_TEXT: Converts a response payload  from  a  binary
                 blob to a Base64-encoded string.

                 If this property is not defined, the response payload will be
                 passed through from the integration  response  to  the  route
                 response or method response without modification.

              CredentialsArn -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  credentials  required for the integration, if
                 any. For AWS integrations, three options  are  available.  To
                 specify an IAM Role for API Gateway to assume, use the role's
                 Amazon Resource Name (ARN).  To  require  that  the  caller's
                 identity  be  passed  through  from  the request, specify the
                 string arn:aws:iam:::user/. To use resource-based permissions
                 on supported AWS services, specify null.

              Description -> (string)
                 Represents the description of an integration.

              IntegrationId -> (string)
                 Represents the identifier of an integration.

              IntegrationMethod -> (string)
                 Specifies the integration's HTTP method type.

              IntegrationResponseSelectionExpression -> (string)
                 The  integration  response selection expression for the inte-
                 gration. Supported only for WebSocket APIs.  See  Integration
                 Response Selection Expressions .

              IntegrationSubtype -> (string)
                 Supported only for HTTP API AWS_PROXY integrations. Specifies
                 the  AWS  service  action  to  invoke.  To  learn  more,  see
                 Integration subtype reference .

              IntegrationType -> (string)
                 The integration type of an integration. One of the following:

                 AWS: for integrating the route or method request with an  AWS
                 service   action,   including  the  Lambda  function-invoking
                 action. With the Lambda  function-invoking  action,  this  is
                 referred  to as the Lambda custom integration. With any other
                 AWS service action, this is known as  AWS  integration.  Sup-
                 ported only for WebSocket APIs.

                 AWS_PROXY: for integrating the route or method request with a
                 Lambda function or other AWS service action. This integration
                 is also referred to as a Lambda proxy integration.

                 HTTP:  for  integrating  the  route or method request with an
                 HTTP endpoint. This integration is also referred  to  as  the
                 HTTP custom integration. Supported only for WebSocket APIs.

                 HTTP_PROXY:  for integrating the route or method request with
                 an HTTP endpoint, with  the  client  request  passed  through
                 as-is. This is also referred to as HTTP proxy integration.

                 MOCK:  for  integrating  the route or method request with API
                 Gateway as a "loopback" endpoint without invoking  any  back-
                 end. Supported only for WebSocket APIs.

              IntegrationUri -> (string)
                 For  a  Lambda integration, specify the URI of a Lambda func-
                 tion.

                 For an HTTP integration, specify a fully-qualified URL.

                 For an HTTP API private integration, specify the  ARN  of  an
                 Application  Load  Balancer  listener,  Network Load Balancer
                 listener, or AWS Cloud Map service. If you specify the ARN of
                 an  AWS Cloud Map service, API Gateway uses DiscoverInstances
                 to identify resources. You can use query parameters to target
                 specific  resources.  To  learn more, see DiscoverInstances .
                 For private integrations, all resources must be owned by  the
                 same AWS account.

              PassthroughBehavior -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  pass-through  behavior  for incoming requests
                 based on the Content-Type header  in  the  request,  and  the
                 available mapping templates specified as the requestTemplates
                 property on the Integration resource. There are  three  valid
                 values:  WHEN_NO_MATCH,  WHEN_NO_TEMPLATES,  and  NEVER. Sup-
                 ported only for WebSocket APIs.

                 WHEN_NO_MATCH passes the request body  for  unmapped  content
                 types  through to the integration backend without transforma-
                 tion.

                 NEVER rejects unmapped content types with an HTTP 415  Unsup-
                 ported Media Type response.

                 WHEN_NO_TEMPLATES  allows  pass-through  when the integration
                 has no content types mapped to templates. However,  if  there
                 is  at least one content type defined, unmapped content types
                 will be rejected with the same  HTTP  415  Unsupported  Media
                 Type response.

              PayloadFormatVersion -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  format of the payload sent to an integration.
                 Required for HTTP APIs.

              RequestParameters -> (map)
                 For WebSocket APIs, a key-value map specifying request param-
                 eters that are passed from the method request to the backend.
                 The key is an integration  request  parameter  name  and  the
                 associated  value  is  a  method  request  parameter value or
                 static value that must be enclosed within single  quotes  and
                 pre-encoded  as  required  by the backend. The method request
                 parameter    value    must    match    the     pattern     of
                 method.request.{location}.{name},  where {location}is querys-
                 tring, path, or header; and {name}must be a valid and  unique
                 method request parameter name.

                 For  HTTP  API  integrations with a specified integrationSub-
                 type, request  parameters  are  a  key-value  map  specifying
                 parameters that are passed to AWS_PROXY integrations. You can
                 provide static values, or map request data, stage  variables,
                 or  context variables that are evaluated at runtime. To learn
                 more, see Working with AWS service integrations for HTTP APIs
                 .

                 For HTTP API itegrations, without a specified integrationSub-
                 type request parameters are a key-value map specifying how to
                 transform  HTTP requests before sending them to backend inte-
                 grations.    The    key    should    follow    the    pattern
                 <action>:<header|querystring|path>.<location>. The action can
                 be append, overwrite or remove. For values, you  can  provide
                 static  values, or map request data, stage variables, or con-
                 text variables that are evaluated at runtime. To learn  more,
                 see Transforming API requests and responses .

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)
                     A string with a length between [1-512].

              RequestTemplates -> (map)
                 Represents  a  map  of Velocity templates that are applied on
                 the request payload based on the value  of  the  Content-Type
                 header  sent by the client. The content type value is the key
                 in this map, and the template (as a  String)  is  the  value.
                 Supported only for WebSocket APIs.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)
                     A string with a length between [0-32768].

              ResponseParameters -> (map)
                 Supported  only for HTTP APIs. You use response parameters to
                 transform the HTTP response from a backend integration before
                 returning  the  response  to clients. Specify a key-value map
                 from a selection key to response  parameters.  The  selection
                 key  must  be  a  valid  HTTP status code within the range of
                 200-599. Response parameters are a  key-value  map.  The  key
                 must  match  pattern  <action>:<header>.<location>  or  over-
                 write.statuscode. The action  can  be  append,  overwrite  or
                 remove.  The  value can be a static value, or map to response
                 data, stage variables, or context variables that  are  evalu-
                 ated at runtime. To learn more, see Transforming API requests
                 and responses .

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (map)
                     For WebSocket APIs, a key-value  map  specifying  request
                     parameters that are passed from the method request to the
                     backend. The key is an integration request parameter name
                     and  the  associated  value is a method request parameter
                     value or static value that must be enclosed within single
                     quotes  and  pre-encoded  as required by the backend. The
                     method request parameter value must match the pattern  of
                     method.request.{location}.{name},    where   {location}is
                     querystring, path, or header; and {name}must be  a  valid
                     and unique method request parameter name.

                     For  HTTP  API  integrations  with  a  specified integra-
                     tionSubtype, request parameters are a key-value map spec-
                     ifying  parameters  that are passed to AWS_PROXY integra-
                     tions. You can provide  static  values,  or  map  request
                     data,  stage  variables,  or  context  variables that are
                     evaluated at runtime. To learn more, see Working with AWS
                     service integrations for HTTP APIs .

                     For  HTTP  API  integrations without a specified integra-
                     tionSubtype request parameters are a key-value map speci-
                     fying  how to transform HTTP requests before sending them
                     to  the  backend.  The  key  should  follow  the  pattern
                     <action>:<header|querystring|path>.<location>       where
                     action can be append, overwrite or  remove.  For  values,
                     you can provide static values, or map request data, stage
                     variables, or context variables  that  are  evaluated  at
                     runtime. To learn more, see Transforming API requests and
                     responses .

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)
                        A string with a length between [1-512].

              TemplateSelectionExpression -> (string)
                 The template selection expression for the  integration.  Sup-
                 ported only for WebSocket APIs.

              TimeoutInMillis -> (integer)
                 Custom  timeout  between  50 and 29,000 milliseconds for Web-
                 Socket APIs and between 50 and 30,000 milliseconds  for  HTTP
                 APIs.  The  default  timeout is 29 seconds for WebSocket APIs
                 and 30 seconds for HTTP APIs.

              TlsConfig -> (structure)
                 The TLS configuration for a private integration. If you spec-
                 ify a TLS configuration, private integration traffic uses the
                 HTTPS protocol. Supported only for HTTP APIs.

                 ServerNameToVerify -> (string)
                     If you specify a server name, API Gateway uses it to ver-
