NAME
       import-api -

DESCRIPTION
       Imports an API.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            import-api
          [--basepath <value>]
          --body <value>
          [--fail-on-warnings | --no-fail-on-warnings]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --basepath (string)
          Specifies  how  to interpret the base path of the API during import.
          Valid values are ignore, prepend, and split. The  default  value  is
          ignore.  To learn more, see Set the OpenAPI basePath Property . Sup-
          ported only for HTTP APIs.

       --body (string)
          The OpenAPI definition. Supported only for HTTP APIs.

       --fail-on-warnings | --no-fail-on-warnings (boolean)
          Specifies whether to rollback the API creation  when  a  warning  is
          encountered.  By  default,  API  creation  continues if a warning is
          encountered.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To import an HTTP API

       The following import-api example creates an HTTP API  from  an  OpenAPI
       3.0 definition file named api-definition.yaml.

          aws apigatewayv2 import-api \
              --body file://api-definition.yaml

       Contents of api-definition.yaml:

          openapi: 3.0.1
          info:
              title: My Lambda API
              version: v1.0
          paths:
              /hello:
                  x-amazon-apigateway-any-method:
                      x-amazon-apigateway-integration:
                          payloadFormatVersion: 2.0
                          type: aws_proxy
                          httpMethod: POST
                          uri: arn:aws:apigateway:us-west-2:lambda:path/2015-03-31/functions/arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:hello/invocations
                          connectionType: INTERNET

       Output:

          {
              "ApiEndpoint": "https://a1b2c3d4.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com",
              "ApiId": "a1b2c3d4",
              "ApiKeySelectionExpression": "$request.header.x-api-key",
              "CreatedDate": "2020-04-08T17:19:38+00:00",
              "Name": "My Lambda API",
              "ProtocolType": "HTTP",

          }

       For  more  information,  see  Working with OpenAPI definitions for HTTP
       APIs in the Amazon API Gateway Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       ApiEndpoint -> (string)
          The URI of the API, of the  form  {api-id}.execute-api.{region}.ama-
          zonaws.com. The stage name is typically appended to this URI to form
          a complete path to a deployed API stage.

       ApiGatewayManaged -> (boolean)
          Specifies whether an API is managed by API Gateway. You can't update
          or  delete  a managed API by using API Gateway. A managed API can be
          deleted only through the tooling or service that created it.

       ApiId -> (string)
          The API ID.

       ApiKeySelectionExpression -> (string)
          An API key selection expression. Supported only for WebSocket  APIs.
          See API Key Selection Expressions .

       CorsConfiguration -> (structure)
          A CORS configuration. Supported only for HTTP APIs.

          AllowCredentials -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether credentials are included in the CORS request.
              Supported only for HTTP APIs.

          AllowHeaders -> (list)
              Represents a collection of allowed headers. Supported  only  for
              HTTP APIs.

              (string)

          AllowMethods -> (list)
              Represents  a collection of allowed HTTP methods. Supported only
              for HTTP APIs.

                 A string with a length between [1-64].

          AllowOrigins -> (list)
              Represents a collection of allowed origins. Supported  only  for
              HTTP APIs.

              (string)

          ExposeHeaders -> (list)
              Represents  a  collection of exposed headers. Supported only for
              HTTP APIs.

              (string)

          MaxAge -> (integer)
              The number of seconds that the browser  should  cache  preflight
              request results. Supported only for HTTP APIs.

       CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp when the API was created.

       Description -> (string)
          The description of the API.

       DisableSchemaValidation -> (boolean)
          Avoid  validating  models when creating a deployment. Supported only

       DisableExecuteApiEndpoint -> (boolean)
          Specifies whether clients can invoke your API by using  the  default
          execute-api  endpoint.  By default, clients can invoke your API with
          the default https://{api_id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com end-
          point.  To  require  that clients use a custom domain name to invoke
          your API, disable the default endpoint.

       ImportInfo -> (list)
          The validation information during API import. This may include  par-
          ticular properties of your OpenAPI definition which are ignored dur-

          If not provided, this will be the default for HTTP APIs. This  prop-
          erty is required for WebSocket APIs.

       Tags -> (map)
          A collection of tags associated with the API.

          key -> (string)

          The  warning messages reported when failonwarnings is turned on dur-
          ing API import.

          (string)
