GET-ROUTES()                                                      GET-ROUTES()



NAME
       get-routes -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the Routes for an API.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-routes  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: Items

SYNOPSIS
            get-routes
          --api-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --api-id (string)
          The API identifier.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (string)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (string)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve a list of routes

       The  following  get-routes  example  displays a list of all of an API's
       routes.

          aws apigatewayv2 get-routes \
              --api-id a1b2c3d4

       Output:

          {
              "Items": [
                  {
                      "ApiKeyRequired": false,
                      "AuthorizationType": "NONE",
                      "RouteId": "72jz1wk",
                      "RouteKey": "ANY /admin",
                      "Target": "integrations/a1b2c3"
                  },
                  {
                      "ApiGatewayManaged": true,
                      "ApiKeyRequired": false,
                      "AuthorizationType": "NONE",
                      "RouteId": "go65gqi",
                      "RouteKey": "$default",
                      "Target": "integrations/a1b2c4"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Items -> (list)
          The elements from this collection.

          (structure)
              Represents a route.

              ApiGatewayManaged -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether  a route is managed by API Gateway. If you
                 created an API using quick create, the $default route is man-
                 aged by API Gateway. You can't modify the $default route key.

              ApiKeyRequired -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether an API key is required for this route. Sup-
                 ported only for WebSocket APIs.

              AuthorizationScopes -> (list)
                 A  list  of  authorization  scopes configured on a route. The
                 scopes are used with a JWT authorizer to authorize the method
                 invocation.  The  authorization  works  by matching the route
                 scopes against the scopes parsed from the access token in the
                 incoming  request. The method invocation is authorized if any
                 route scope matches a claimed scope in the access token. Oth-
                 erwise,  the  invocation  is  not  authorized. When the route
                 scope is configured, the client must provide an access  token
                 instead of an identity token for authorization purposes.

                 (string)
                     A string with a length between [1-64].

              AuthorizationType -> (string)
                 The  authorization  type  for  the route. For WebSocket APIs,
                 valid values are NONE for open access, AWS_IAM for using  AWS
                 IAM permissions, and CUSTOM for using a Lambda authorizer For
                 HTTP APIs, valid values are NONE for  open  access,  JWT  for
                 using JSON Web Tokens, AWS_IAM for using AWS IAM permissions,
                 and CUSTOM for using a Lambda authorizer.

              AuthorizerId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the Authorizer resource  to  be  associated
                 with  this  route.  The authorizer identifier is generated by
                 API Gateway when you created the authorizer.

              ModelSelectionExpression -> (string)
                 The model selection expression for the route. Supported  only
                 for WebSocket APIs.

              OperationName -> (string)
                 The operation name for the route.

              RequestModels -> (map)
                 The  request  models  for  the route. Supported only for Web-
                 Socket APIs.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)
                     A string with a length between [1-128].

              RequestParameters -> (map)
                 The request parameters for the route. Supported only for Web-
                 Socket APIs.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     Validation constraints imposed on parameters of a request
                     (path, query string, headers).

                     Required -> (boolean)
                        Whether or not the parameter is required.

              RouteId -> (string)
                 The route ID.

              RouteKey -> (string)
                 The route key for the route.

              RouteResponseSelectionExpression -> (string)
                 The route response selection expression for the  route.  Sup-
                 ported only for WebSocket APIs.

              Target -> (string)
                 The target for the route.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  next  page  of elements from this collection. Not valid for the
          last element of the collection.
