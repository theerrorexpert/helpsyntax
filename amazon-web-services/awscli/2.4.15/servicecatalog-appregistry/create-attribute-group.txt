CREATE-ATTRIBUTE-GROUP()                              CREATE-ATTRIBUTE-GROUP()



NAME
       create-attribute-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates   a  new  attribute  group  as  a  container  for  user-defined
       attributes. This feature enables users to have full control over  their
       cloud  application's  metadata  in  a  rich  machine-readable format to
       facilitate integration with automated workflows and third-party  tools.

SYNOPSIS
            create-attribute-group
          --name <value>
          [--description <value>]
          --attributes <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the attribute group.

       --description (string)
          The description of the attribute group that the user provides.

       --attributes (string)
          A  JSON  string in the form of nested key-value pairs that represent
          the attributes in the group and describes  an  application  and  its
          components.

       --tags (map)
          Key-value pairs you can use to associate with the attribute group.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique  identifier that you provide to ensure idempotency. If you
          retry a request that completed successfully using  the  same  client
          token and the same parameters, the retry succeeds without performing
          any further actions. If you retry a  successful  request  using  the
          same  client token, but one or more of the parameters are different,
          the retry fails.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       attributeGroup -> (structure)
          Information about the attribute group.

          id -> (string)
              The globally unique attribute group identifier of the  attribute
              group.

          arn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  resource  name  (ARN)  that specifies the attribute
              group across services.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the attribute group.

          description -> (string)
              The description of the attribute group that the user provides.

          creationTime -> (timestamp)
              The ISO-8601 formatted timestamp of  the  moment  the  attribute
              group was created.

          lastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
              The  ISO-8601  formatted  timestamp  of the moment the attribute
              group was last updated. This time is the same as  the  creation-
              Time for a newly created attribute group.

          tags -> (map)
              Key-value  pairs  you  can  use  to associate with the attribute
              group.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)
