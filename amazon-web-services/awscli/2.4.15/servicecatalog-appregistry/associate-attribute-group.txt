ASSOCIATE-ATTRIBUTE-GROUP()                        ASSOCIATE-ATTRIBUTE-GROUP()



NAME
       associate-attribute-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates an attribute group with an application to augment the appli-
       cation's metadata with the group's  attributes.  This  feature  enables
       applications  to  be  described  with  user-defined  details  that  are
       machine-readable, such as third-party integrations.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            associate-attribute-group
          --application <value>
          --attribute-group <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application (string)
          The name or ID of the application.

       --attribute-group (string)
          The name or ID of the attribute group that holds the  attributes  to
          describe the application.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       applicationArn -> (string)
          The Amazon resource name (ARN) of the application that was augmented
          with attributes.

       attributeGroupArn -> (string)
          The Amazon resource name (ARN) of the attribute group that  contains
          the application's new attributes.
