OPTIONS
       --input-data-config (structure)
          The input properties for a PII entities detection job.

          S3Uri -> (string)
              The Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The URI must  be  in  same
              region  as  the  API  endpoint that you are calling. The URI can
              point to a single input file or it can provide the prefix for  a
              collection of data files.

              For  example, if you use the URI S3://bucketName/prefix , if the
              prefix is a single file, Amazon Comprehend  uses  that  file  as
              input. If more than one file begins with the prefix, Amazon Com-
              prehend uses all of them as input.

          InputFormat -> (string)
              Specifies how the text in an input file should be processed:

              o ONE_DOC_PER_FILE - Each file is considered  a  separate  docu-
                ment. Use this option when you are processing large documents,
                such as newspaper articles or scientific papers.

              o ONE_DOC_PER_LINE - Each line in a file is considered  a  sepa-
                rate  document.  Use  this option when you are processing many
                short documents, such as text messages.

          DocumentReaderConfig -> (structure)
              The document reader config field applies only for  InputDataCon-
              fig of StartEntitiesDetectionJob.

              Use DocumentReaderConfig to provide specifications about how you
              want your inference documents read. Currently it applies for PDF
              documents in StartEntitiesDetectionJob custom inference.

              DocumentReadAction -> (string)
                 This  enum  field will start with two values which will apply
                 to PDFs:

                 o TEXTRACT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_TEXT - The service  calls  Detect-
                   DocumentText for PDF documents per page.

                 o TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT  - The service calls AnalyzeDocu-
                   ment for PDF documents per page.

              DocumentReadMode -> (string)
                 This enum field provides two values:

                 o SERVICE_DEFAULT - use service defaults for  Document  read-
                   ing. For Digital PDF it would mean using an internal parser
                   instead of Textract APIs

                 o FORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION - Always  use  specified  action
                   for DocumentReadAction, including Digital PDF.

              FeatureTypes -> (list)
                 Specifies how the text in an input file should be processed:

                 (string)
                     A  list  of  the types of analyses to perform. This field
                     specifies what feature types need to  be  extracted  from
                     the document where entity recognition is expected.

                     o TABLES  -  Add TABLES to the list to return information
                       about the tables that are detected in the  input  docu-
                       ment.

                     o FORMS - Add FORMS to return detected form data.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Uri=string,InputFormat=string,DocumentReaderConfig={DocumentReadAction=string,DocumentReadMode=string,FeatureTypes=[string,string]}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Uri": "string",
            "InputFormat": "ONE_DOC_PER_FILE"|"ONE_DOC_PER_LINE",
            "DocumentReaderConfig": {
              "DocumentReadAction": "TEXTRACT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_TEXT"|"TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT",
              "DocumentReadMode": "SERVICE_DEFAULT"|"FORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION",
              "FeatureTypes": ["TABLES"|"FORMS", ...]
            }
          }

       --output-data-config (structure)
          Provides  conguration parameters for the output of PII entity detec-
          tion jobs.

          S3Uri -> (string)
              When you use the OutputDataConfig object with asynchronous oper-
              ations,  you  specify  the  Amazon S3 location where you want to
              write the output data. The URI must be in the same region as the
              API  endpoint  that you are calling. The location is used as the
              prefix for the actual location of the output file.

              When the topic detection job is finished, the service creates an
              output  file in a directory specific to the job. The S3Uri field
              contains the location of the output file, called output.tar.gz .
              It is a compressed archive that contains the ouput of the opera-
              tion.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              ID for the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key that Amazon Com-
              prehend uses to encrypt the output results from an analysis job.
              The KmsKeyId can be one of the following formats:

              o KMS Key ID: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

              o Amazon    Resource    Name    (ARN)    of    a    KMS     Key:
                "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

              o KMS Key Alias: "alias/ExampleAlias"

              o ARN        of         a         KMS         Key         Alias:
                "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias"

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Uri=string,KmsKeyId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Uri": "string",
            "KmsKeyId": "string"
          }

       --mode (string)
          Specifies whether the output provides the locations (offsets) of PII
          entities or a file in which PII entities are redacted.

          Possible values:

          o ONLY_REDACTION

          o ONLY_OFFSETS

       --redaction-config (structure)
          Provides configuration parameters for PII entity redaction.

          This parameter  is  required  if  you  set  the  Mode  parameter  to
          ONLY_REDACTION  .  In  that case, you must provide a RedactionConfig
          definition that includes the PiiEntityTypes parameter.

          PiiEntityTypes -> (list)
              An array of the types of PII  entities  that  Amazon  Comprehend
              detects in the input text for your request.

              (string)

          MaskMode -> (string)
              Specifies whether the PII entity is redacted with the mask char-
              acter or the entity type.

          MaskCharacter -> (string)
              A character that replaces each character  in  the  redacted  PII
              entity.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          PiiEntityTypes=string,string,MaskMode=string,MaskCharacter=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "PiiEntityTypes": ["BANK_ACCOUNT_NUMBER"|"BANK_ROUTING"|"CREDIT_DEBIT_NUMBER"|"CREDIT_DEBIT_CVV"|"CREDIT_DEBIT_EXPIRY"|"PIN"|"EMAIL"|"ADDRESS"|"NAME"|"PHONE"|"SSN"|"DATE_TIME"|"PASSPORT_NUMBER"|"DRIVER_ID"|"URL"|"AGE"|"USERNAME"|"PASSWORD"|"AWS_ACCESS_KEY"|"AWS_SECRET_KEY"|"IP_ADDRESS"|"MAC_ADDRESS"|"ALL", ...],
            "MaskMode": "MASK"|"REPLACE_WITH_PII_ENTITY_TYPE",
            "MaskCharacter": "string"
          }

       --data-access-role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and Access Man-
          agement (IAM) role that grants Amazon Comprehend read access to your
          input data.

       --job-name (string)
          The identifier of the job.

       --language-code (string)

          o zh-TW

       --client-request-token (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for  the request. If you don't set the client
          request token, Amazon Comprehend generates one.

       --tags (list)
          Tags to be associated with the PII entities detection job. A tag  is
          a  key-value  pair  that  adds metadata to a resource used by Amazon
          Comprehend. For example, a tag with "Sales"  as  the  key  might  be
          added to a resource to indicate its use by the sales department.

          (structure)
              A  key-value  pair that adds as a metadata to a resource used by
              Amazon Comprehend. For example, a tag with  the  key-value  pair
              Department:Sales  might  be  added to a resource to indicate its
              use by a particular department.

              Key -> (string)
                 The initial part of a key-value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For instance, if you want to show
                 which resources are used by which departments, you might  use
                 Department as the key portion of the pair, with multiple pos-
                 sible values such as sales, legal, and administration.

              Value -> (string)
                 The second part of a key-value pair that forms a tag  associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For instance, if you want to show
                 which resources are used by which departments, you might  use
                 Department  as  the initial (key) portion of the pair, with a
                 value of sales to indicate the sales department.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          The identifier generated for the job.

       JobArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the PII entity detection  job.  It
          is a unique, fully qualified identifier for the job. It includes the
          AWS account, Region, and the job ID. The format of  the  ARN  is  as
          follows:
