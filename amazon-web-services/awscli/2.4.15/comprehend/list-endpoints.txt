NAME
       list-endpoints -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of all existing endpoints that you've created.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-endpoints
          [--filter <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filter (structure)
          Filters the endpoints that are returned. You can filter endpoints on
          their name, model, status, or the date and time that they were  cre-
          ated. You can only set one filter at a time.

          ModelArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the model to which the end-
              point is attached.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the status of the endpoint  being  returned.  Possible
              values are: Creating, Ready, Updating, Deleting, Failed.

          CreationTimeBefore -> (timestamp)
              Specifies a date before which the returned endpoint or endpoints
              were created.

          CreationTimeAfter -> (timestamp)
              Specifies a date after which the returned endpoint or  endpoints
              were created.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ModelArn=string,Status=string,CreationTimeBefore=timestamp,CreationTimeAfter=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ModelArn": "string",
            "Status": "CREATING"|"DELETING"|"FAILED"|"IN_SERVICE"|"UPDATING",
            "CreationTimeBefore": timestamp,
            "CreationTimeAfter": timestamp
          }

       --next-token (string)
          Identifies the next page of results to return.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return in each page. The default is
          100.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EndpointPropertiesList -> (list)
          Displays a list of endpoint properties being retrieved by  the  ser-
          vice in response to the request.

          (structure)
              Specifies information about the specified endpoint.

              EndpointArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the endpoint.

              Status -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  status  of the endpoint. Because the endpoint
                 updates and creation are asynchronous, so customers will need
                 to  wait  for  the  endpoint to be Ready status before making
                 inference requests.

              Message -> (string)
                 Specifies a reason for failure in cases of Failed status.

              ModelArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the model  to  which  the
                 endpoint is attached.

              DesiredModelArn -> (string)
                 ARN  of  the  new  model to use for updating an existing end-
                 point. This ARN is going to be different from the  model  ARN
                 when the update is in progress

              DesiredInferenceUnits -> (integer)
                 The desired number of inference units to be used by the model
                 using this endpoint. Each  inference  unit  represents  of  a
                 throughput of 100 characters per second.

              CurrentInferenceUnits -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  inference  units currently used by the model
                 using this endpoint.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The creation date and time of the endpoint.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the endpoint was last modified.

              DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS identity and Access
                 Management  (IAM)  role  that  grants  Amazon Comprehend read
                 access to trained custom models  encrypted  with  a  customer
                 managed key (ModelKmsKeyId).

              DesiredDataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 Data  access  role  ARN  to  use  in  case  the  new model is
                 encrypted with a customer KMS key.

       NextToken -> (string)
          Identifies the next page of results to return.
