NAME
       describe-pii-entities-detection-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the  properties associated with a PII entities detection job. For
       example, you can use this operation to get the job status.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-pii-entities-detection-job
          --job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The identifier that Amazon Comprehend generated  for  the  job.  The
          operation returns this identifier in its response.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PiiEntitiesDetectionJobProperties -> (structure)
          Provides information about a PII entities detection job.

          JobId -> (string)
              The identifier assigned to the PII entities detection job.

          JobArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the PII entities detection
              job. It is a unique, fully qualified identifier for the job.  It
              includes  the AWS account, Region, and the job ID. The format of
              the ARN is as follows:
                 arn:<partition>:comprehend:<region>:<account-id>:pii-enti-
                 ties-detection-job/<job-id>

              The following is an example job ARN:
                 arn:aws:comprehend:us-west-2:111122223333:pii-entities-detec-
                 tion-job/1234abcd12ab34cd56ef1234567890ab

          JobName -> (string)
              The name that you assigned the PII entities detection job.

          JobStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the PII entities  detection  job.  If  the
              status  is  FAILED  , the Message field shows the reason for the
              failure.

          Message -> (string)
              A description of the status of a job.

          SubmitTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the PII entities detection job was  submitted  for
              processing.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the PII entities detection job completed.

          InputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The input properties for a PII entities detection job.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The URI must be in same
                 region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The URI  can
                 point to a single input file or it can provide the prefix for
                 a collection of data files.

                 For example, if you use the URI S3://bucketName/prefix  ,  if
                 the prefix is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses that file
                 as input. If more than one file begins with the prefix,  Ama-
                 zon Comprehend uses all of them as input.

              InputFormat -> (string)
                 Specifies how the text in an input file should be processed:

                 o ONE_DOC_PER_FILE - Each file is considered a separate docu-
                   ment. Use this option when you are processing  large  docu-
                   ments, such as newspaper articles or scientific papers.

                 o ONE_DOC_PER_LINE - Each line in a file is considered a sep-
                   arate document. Use this option  when  you  are  processing
                   many short documents, such as text messages.

              DocumentReaderConfig -> (structure)
                 The  document reader config field applies only for InputData-
                 Config of StartEntitiesDetectionJob.

                 Use DocumentReaderConfig to provide specifications about  how
                 you  want your inference documents read. Currently it applies
                 for PDF documents in StartEntitiesDetectionJob custom  infer-
                 ence.

                 DocumentReadAction -> (string)
                     This  enum  field  will  start with two values which will
                     apply to PDFs:

                     o TEXTRACT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_TEXT  -  The   service   calls
                       DetectDocumentText for PDF documents per page.

                     o TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT  - The service calls Analyze-
                       Document for PDF documents per page.

                 DocumentReadMode -> (string)
                     This enum field provides two values:

                     o SERVICE_DEFAULT - use  service  defaults  for  Document
                       reading.  For Digital PDF it would mean using an inter-
                       nal parser instead of Textract APIs

                     o FORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION  -  Always   use   specified
                       action for DocumentReadAction, including Digital PDF.

                 FeatureTypes -> (list)
                     Specifies  how  the  text in an input file should be pro-
                     cessed:

                     (string)
                        A list of the types of analyses to perform. This field
                        specifies what feature types need to be extracted from
                        the document where entity recognition is expected.

                        o TABLES - Add TABLES to the list to  return  informa-
                          tion about the tables that are detected in the input
                          document.

                        o FORMS - Add FORMS to return detected form data.

          OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The output data configuration that you supplied when you created
              the PII entities detection job.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 When you use the PiiOutputDataConfig object with asynchronous
                 operations, you specify the Amazon S3 location where you want
                 to write the output data.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 ID  for  the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key that Amazon
                 Comprehend uses to encrypt the output results from an  analy-
                 sis job.

          RedactionConfig -> (structure)
              Provides configuration parameters for PII entity redaction.

              This  parameter  is  required  if  you set the Mode parameter to
              ONLY_REDACTION . In that case, you must provide a  RedactionCon-
              fig definition that includes the PiiEntityTypes parameter.

              PiiEntityTypes -> (list)
                 An  array of the types of PII entities that Amazon Comprehend
                 detects in the input text for your request.

                 (string)

              MaskMode -> (string)
                 Specifies whether the PII entity is redacted  with  the  mask
                 character or the entity type.

              MaskCharacter -> (string)
                 A  character that replaces each character in the redacted PII
                 entity.

          LanguageCode -> (string)
              The language code of the input documents

          DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that gives Amazon Comprehend read
              access to your input data.

          Mode -> (string)
              Specifies whether the output provides the locations (offsets) of
              PII entities or a file in which PII entities are redacted.
