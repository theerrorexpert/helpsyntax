NAME
       detect-entities -

DESCRIPTION
       Inspects  text  for named entities, and returns information about them.
       For more information, about named entities, see  how-entities .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            detect-entities
          --text <value>
          [--language-code <value>]
          [--endpoint-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --text (string)
          A UTF-8 text string. Each string must contain fewer that 5,000 bytes
          of UTF-8 encoded characters.

       --language-code (string)
          The language of the input documents. You can specify any of the pri-
          mary languages supported by Amazon Comprehend. All documents must be
          in the same language.

          If  your  request includes the endpoint for a custom entity recogni-
          tion model, Amazon Comprehend  uses  the  language  of  your  custom
          model, and it ignores any language code that you specify here.

          Possible values:

          o en

          o es

          o fr

          o de

          o it

          o pt

          o ar

          o hi

          o ja

          o ko

          o zh

          o zh-TW

       --endpoint-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name of an endpoint that is associated with a
          custom entity recognition model. Provide an endpoint if you want  to
          detect  entities  by  using  your  own  custom  model instead of the
          default model that is used by Amazon Comprehend.

          If you specify an endpoint, Amazon Comprehend uses the  language  of
          your custom model, and it ignores any language code that you provide
          in your request.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Entities -> (list)
          A collection of entities identified in  the  input  text.  For  each
          entity,  the  response  provides the entity text, entity type, where
          the entity text begins and ends, and the level  of  confidence  that
          Amazon Comprehend has in the detection.

          If  your request uses a custom entity recognition model, Amazon Com-
          prehend detects the entities that the model is trained to recognize.
          Otherwise,  it  detects  the  default  entity  types.  For a list of
          default entity types, see  how-entities .

          (structure)
              Provides information about an entity.

              Score -> (float)
                 The level of confidence that Amazon  Comprehend  has  in  the
                 accuracy of the detection.

              Type -> (string)
                 The entity's type.

              Text -> (string)
                 The text of the entity.

              BeginOffset -> (integer)
                 A  character  offset  in  the input text that shows where the
                 entity begins (the first character is  at  position  0).  The
                 offset  returns  the position of each UTF-8 code point in the
                 string. A code point is the abstract character from a partic-
                 ular  graphical  representation.  For  example,  a multi-byte
                 UTF-8 character maps to a single code point.

              EndOffset -> (integer)
                 A character offset in the input text  that  shows  where  the
                 entity  ends.  The  offset returns the position of each UTF-8
                 code point in the string. A code point is the abstract  char-
                 acter  from  a particular graphical representation. For exam-
                 ple, a multi-byte UTF-8  character  maps  to  a  single  code
                 point.
