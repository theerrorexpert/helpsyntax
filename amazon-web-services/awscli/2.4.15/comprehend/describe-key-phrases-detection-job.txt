DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the  properties  associated with a key phrases detection job. Use
       this operation to get the status of a detection job.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-key-phrases-detection-job
          --job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The identifier that Amazon Comprehend generated  for  the  job.  The
          operation returns this identifier in its response.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       KeyPhrasesDetectionJobProperties -> (structure)
          An object that contains the properties associated with a key phrases
          detection job.

          JobArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the key phrases detection job.
              It  is  a  unique,  fully  qualified  identifier for the job. It
              includes the AWS account, Region, and the job ID. The format  of
              the ARN is as follows:
                 arn:<partition>:compre-
                 hend:<region>:<account-id>:key-phrases-detection-job/<job-id>

              The following is an example job ARN:
                 arn:aws:comprehend:us-west-2:111122223333:key-phrases-detec-
                 tion-job/1234abcd12ab34cd56ef1234567890ab

          JobName -> (string)
              The name that you assigned the key phrases detection job.

          JobStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the key phrases detection job. If the sta-
              tus is FAILED , the Message field shows the reason for the fail-
              ure.

          Message -> (string)
              A description of the status of a job.

          SubmitTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the key phrases detection job  was  submitted  for
              processing.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the key phrases detection job completed.

          InputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The  input data configuration that you supplied when you created
              the key phrases detection job.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The URI must be in same
                 region  as the API endpoint that you are calling. The URI can
                 point to a single input file or it can provide the prefix for
                 a collection of data files.

                 For  example,  if you use the URI S3://bucketName/prefix , if
                 the prefix is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses that file
                 as  input. If more than one file begins with the prefix, Ama-
                 zon Comprehend uses all of them as input.

              InputFormat -> (string)
                 Specifies how the text in an input file should be processed:

                 o ONE_DOC_PER_FILE - Each file is considered a separate docu-
                   ment.  Use  this option when you are processing large docu-
                   ments, such as newspaper articles or scientific papers.

                 o ONE_DOC_PER_LINE - Each line in a file is considered a sep-
                   arate  document.  Use  this  option when you are processing
                   many short documents, such as text messages.

              DocumentReaderConfig -> (structure)
                 The document reader config field applies only for  InputData-
                 Config of StartEntitiesDetectionJob.

                 Use  DocumentReaderConfig to provide specifications about how
                 you want your inference documents read. Currently it  applies
                 for  PDF documents in StartEntitiesDetectionJob custom infer-
                 ence.

                 DocumentReadAction -> (string)
                     This enum field will start with  two  values  which  will
                     apply to PDFs:

                     o TEXTRACT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_TEXT   -   The  service  calls
                       DetectDocumentText for PDF documents per page.

                     o TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT - The service calls  Analyze-
                       Document for PDF documents per page.

                 DocumentReadMode -> (string)
                     This enum field provides two values:

                     o SERVICE_DEFAULT  -  use  service  defaults for Document
                       reading. For Digital PDF it would mean using an  inter-
                       nal parser instead of Textract APIs

                     o FORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION   -   Always  use  specified
                       action for DocumentReadAction, including Digital PDF.

                 FeatureTypes -> (list)
                     Specifies how the text in an input file  should  be  pro-
                     cessed:

                     (string)
                        A list of the types of analyses to perform. This field
                        specifies what feature types need to be extracted from
                        the document where entity recognition is expected.

                        o TABLES  -  Add TABLES to the list to return informa-
                          tion about the tables that are detected in the input
                          document.

                        o FORMS - Add FORMS to return detected form data.

          OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The output data configuration that you supplied when you created
              the key phrases detection job.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 When you use the OutputDataConfig  object  with  asynchronous
                 operations, you specify the Amazon S3 location where you want
                 to write the output data. The URI must be in the same  region
                 as  the  API  endpoint  that you are calling. The location is
                 used as the prefix for the  actual  location  of  the  output
                 file.

                 When the topic detection job is finished, the service creates
                 an output file in a directory specific to the job. The  S3Uri
                 field  contains  the location of the output file, called out-
                 put.tar.gz . It is a compressed  archive  that  contains  the
                 ouput of the operation.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 ID  for  the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key that Amazon
                 Comprehend uses to encrypt the output results from an  analy-
                 sis job. The KmsKeyId can be one of the following formats:

                 o KMS Key ID: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                 o Amazon    Resource    Name    (ARN)    of    a   KMS   Key:
                   "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                 o KMS Key Alias: "alias/ExampleAlias"

                 o ARN         of        a        KMS        Key        Alias:
                   "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias"
