NAME
       describe-entity-recognizer -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  details about an entity recognizer including status, S3 buck-
       ets containing training data, recognizer metadata, metrics, and so  on.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-entity-recognizer
          --entity-recognizer-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --entity-recognizer-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) that identifies the entity recog-
          nizer.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EntityRecognizerProperties -> (structure)
          Describes information associated with an entity recognizer.

          EntityRecognizerArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the entity recog-
              nizer.

          LanguageCode -> (string)
              The  language  of  the input documents. All documents must be in
              the same language. Only English ("en") is currently supported.

              Provides the status of the entity recognizer.

          Message -> (string)
              A description of the status of the recognizer.

          SubmitTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the recognizer was submitted for processing.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the recognizer creation completed.

          TrainingStartTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that training of the entity recognizer started.

          TrainingEndTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that training of the entity recognizer was completed.

          InputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The input data properties of an entity recognizer.

              DataFormat -> (string)
                 The format of your training data:

                 o COMPREHEND_CSV : A CSV file that supplements your  training
                   documents. The CSV file contains information about the cus-
                   tom entities that  your  trained  model  will  detect.  The
                   required format of the file depends on whether you are pro-
                   viding annotations or an  entity  list.  If  you  use  this
                   value,  you  must provide your CSV file by using either the
                   Annotations or EntityList parameters. You must provide your
                   training documents by using the Documents parameter.

                 o AUGMENTED_MANIFEST  : A labeled dataset that is produced by
                   Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth. This file is in  JSON  lines
                   format. Each line is a complete JSON object that contains a
                   training document and its labels. Each  label  annotates  a
                   named  entity  in  the  training document.  If you use this
                   value, you must provide the AugmentedManifests parameter in
                   your request.

                 If  you don't specify a value, Amazon Comprehend uses COMPRE-
                 HEND_CSV as the default.

              EntityTypes -> (list)
                 The entity types in the labeled  training  data  that  Amazon
                 Comprehend  uses  to  train the custom entity recognizer. Any
                 entity types that you don't specify are ignored.

                 A maximum of 25 entity types can be used at one time to train
                 an  entity recognizer. Entity types must not contain the fol-
                 lowing invalid characters: n (line break), \n  (escaped  line
                 break),  r (carriage return), \r (escaped carriage return), t
                 (tab), \t (escaped tab), space, and , (comma).

                     An entity type within a  labeled  training  dataset  that
                     Amazon  Comprehend  uses  to train a custom entity recog-
                     nizer.

                     Type -> (string)
                        An entity type within a labeled training dataset  that
                        Amazon Comprehend uses to train a custom entity recog-
                        nizer.

                        Entity types must not contain  the  following  invalid
                        characters:  n (line break), \n (escaped line break, r
                        (carriage return), \r  (escaped  carriage  return),  t
                        (tab), \t (escaped tab), space, and , (comma).

              Documents -> (structure)
                 The S3 location of the folder that contains the training doc-
                 uments for your custom entity recognizer.

                 This parameter is required if you set DataFormat  to  COMPRE-
                 HEND_CSV .

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     Specifies the Amazon S3 location where the training docu-
                     ments for an entity recognizer are located. The URI  must
                     be  in  the  same region as the API endpoint that you are

                     Specifies  how  the  text in an input file should be pro-
                     cessed.  This   is   optional,   and   the   default   is
                     ONE_DOC_PER_LINE. ONE_DOC_PER_FILE - Each file is consid-
                     ered a separate document. Use this option  when  you  are
                     processing large documents, such as newspaper articles or
                     scientific papers. ONE_DOC_PER_LINE - Each line in a file
                     is  considered  a separate document. Use this option when
                     you are processing many short  documents,  such  as  text
                     messages.

              Annotations -> (structure)
                 The  S3 location of the CSV file that annotates your training

                 TestS3Uri -> (string)
                     This  specifies  the  Amazon  S3  location where the test
                     annotations for an entity recognizer are located. The URI
                     must  be  in the same AWS Region as the API endpoint that
                     you are calling.

              EntityList -> (structure)
                 The S3 location of the CSV file that has the entity list  for
                 your custom entity recognizer.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     Specifies the Amazon S3 location where the entity list is
                     located. The URI must be in the same region  as  the  API

                 A list of augmented manifest files that provide training data
                 for your custom  model.  An  augmented  manifest  file  is  a
                 labeled  dataset  that is produced by Amazon SageMaker Ground
                 Truth.

                 This parameter is required if  you  set  DataFormat  to  AUG-
                 MENTED_MANIFEST .

                 (structure)
                     An  augmented  manifest  file that provides training data
                     for your custom model. An augmented manifest  file  is  a
                     labeled  dataset  that  is  produced  by Amazon SageMaker
                     Ground Truth.

                     S3Uri -> (string)
                        The Amazon S3 location of the augmented manifest file.

                     Split -> (string)
                        The  purpose  of  the data you've provided in the aug-
                        mented manifest. You can either  train  or  test  this
                        data. If you don't specify, the default is train.

                        TRAIN  -  all of the documents in the manifest will be
                        used for training. If no test documents are  provided,
                        Amazon Comprehend will automatically reserve a portion
                        of the training documents for testing.

                        TEST - all of the documents in the  manifest  will  be
                        used for testing.

                        The  JSON  attribute that contains the annotations for
                        your training documents. The number of attribute names
                        that  you  specify  depends  on whether your augmented
                        manifest file is the output of a single  labeling  job
                        or a chained labeling job.

                        If  your  file is the output of a single labeling job,
                        specify the LabelAttributeName key that was used  when
                        the job was created in Ground Truth.

                        If  your file is the output of a chained labeling job,
                        specify the LabelAttributeName key  for  one  or  more
                        jobs  in  the  chain. Each LabelAttributeName key pro-
                        vides the annotations from an individual job.

                        (string)

                     AnnotationDataS3Uri -> (string)
                        The  S3  prefix  to  the  annotation  files  that  are
                        referred in the augmented manifest file.

                     SourceDocumentsS3Uri -> (string)
                        The  S3  prefix  to  the  source files (PDFs) that are
                        referred to in the augmented manifest file.

                     DocumentType -> (string)
                        The type of augmented manifest.  PlainTextDocument  or
                        SemiStructuredDocument.  If  you  don't  specify,  the
                        default is PlainTextDocument.

                        o PLAIN_TEXT_DOCUMENT A document type that  represents
                          any unicode text that is encoded in UTF-8.

                        o SEMI_STRUCTURED_DOCUMENT  A document type with posi-
                          tional and  structural  context,  like  a  PDF.  For
                          training  with Amazon Comprehend, only PDFs are sup-
                          ported. For  inference,  Amazon  Comprehend  support
                          PDFs, DOCX and TXT.

                 The  number  of documents in the input data that were used to
                 train the entity recognizer. Typically this is 80 to 90  per-
                 cent of the input documents.

              NumberOfTestDocuments -> (integer)
                 The  number  of documents in the input data that were used to
                 test the entity recognizer. Typically this is 10 to  20  per-

                 nizer.

                 Precision -> (double)
                     A measure of the usefulness of the recognizer results  in
                     the  test  data. High precision means that the recognizer
                     returned substantially more relevant results than irrele-
                     vant ones.

                 Recall -> (double)
                     A  measure of how complete the recognizer results are for
                     the test data. High  recall  means  that  the  recognizer
                     returned most of the relevant results.

                 F1Score -> (double)
                     A  measure of how accurate the recognizer results are for
                     the test data. It  is  derived  from  the  Precision  and
                     Recall values. The F1Score is the harmonic average of the
                     two scores. The highest score is 1, and the  worst  score
                     is 0.

              EntityTypes -> (list)

                        Detailed  information about the accuracy of the entity
                        recognizer for a specific item on the list  of  entity
                        types.

                        Precision -> (double)
                            A  measure  of  the  usefulness  of the recognizer
                            results for a specific entity  type  in  the  test
                            data.  High  precision  means  that the recognizer
                            returned substantially more relevant results  than
                            irrelevant ones.

                        Recall -> (double)
                            A  measure  of how complete the recognizer results
                            are for a specific entity type in the  test  data.
                            High  recall  means  that  the recognizer returned
                            most of the relevant results.

                        F1Score -> (double)
                            A measure of how accurate the  recognizer  results
                            are  for  a specific entity type in the test data.
                            It is derived from the Precision and  Recall  val-
                            ues.  The  F1Score  is the harmonic average of the
                            two scores. The highest score is 1, and the  worst
                            score is 0.

                     NumberOfTrainMentions -> (integer)
                        Indicates  the  number  of times the given entity type
                        was seen in the training data.

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity  and  Manage-
              ment  (IAM)  role  that  grants Amazon Comprehend read access to
              your input data.

          VolumeKmsKeyId -> (string)
              ID for the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key that Amazon Com-
              prehend  uses  to encrypt data on the storage volume attached to
              the ML compute instance(s) that process the  analysis  job.  The
              VolumeKmsKeyId can be either of the following formats:
