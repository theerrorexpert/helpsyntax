DETECT-DOMINANT-LANGUAGE()                          DETECT-DOMINANT-LANGUAGE()



NAME
       detect-dominant-language -

DESCRIPTION
       Determines  the dominant language of the input text. For a list of lan-
       guages that Amazon Comprehend can detect, see  Amazon  Comprehend  Sup-
       ported Languages .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            detect-dominant-language
          --text <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --text (string)
          A  UTF-8 text string. Each string should contain at least 20 charac-
          ters and must contain fewer that 5,000 bytes of UTF-8 encoded  char-
          acters.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Languages -> (list)
          The languages that Amazon Comprehend detected in the input text. For
          each language, the response returns the RFC 5646 language  code  and
          the  level  of confidence that Amazon Comprehend has in the accuracy
          of its inference. For more information about RFC 5646, see Tags  for
          Identifying Languages on the IETF Tools web site.

          (structure)
              Returns the code for the dominant language in the input text and
              the level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend has in the  accu-
              racy of the detection.

              LanguageCode -> (string)
                 The  RFC  5646  language  code for the dominant language. For
                 more information about RFC 5646,  see  Tags  for  Identifying
                 Languages on the IETF Tools web site.

              Score -> (float)
                 The  level  of  confidence  that Amazon Comprehend has in the
                 accuracy of the detection.
