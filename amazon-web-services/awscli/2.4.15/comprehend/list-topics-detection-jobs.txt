LIST-TOPICS-DETECTION-JOBS()                      LIST-TOPICS-DETECTION-JOBS()



NAME
       list-topics-detection-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of the topic detection jobs that you have submitted.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-topics-detection-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: TopicsDetectionJobPropertiesList

SYNOPSIS
            list-topics-detection-jobs
          [--filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filter (structure)
          Filters the jobs that are returned. Jobs can be  filtered  on  their
          name, status, or the date and time that they were submitted. You can
          set only one filter at a time.

          JobName -> (string)

          JobStatus -> (string)
              Filters the list of topic detection jobs based  on  job  status.
              Returns only jobs with the specified status.

          SubmitTimeBefore -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of jobs based on the time that the job was sub-
              mitted for processing. Only returns jobs  submitted  before  the
              specified time. Jobs are returned in descending order, newest to
              oldest.

          SubmitTimeAfter -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of jobs based on the time that the job was sub-
              mitted  for  processing.  Only  returns jobs submitted after the
              specified time. Jobs are returned in ascending order, oldest  to
              newest.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          JobName=string,JobStatus=string,SubmitTimeBefore=timestamp,SubmitTimeAfter=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "JobName": "string",
            "JobStatus": "SUBMITTED"|"IN_PROGRESS"|"COMPLETED"|"FAILED"|"STOP_REQUESTED"|"STOPPED",
            "SubmitTimeBefore": timestamp,
            "SubmitTimeAfter": timestamp
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TopicsDetectionJobPropertiesList -> (list)
          A list containing the properties of each job that is returned.

          (structure)
              Provides information about a topic detection job.

              JobId -> (string)
                 The identifier assigned to the topic detection job.

              JobArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the topics  detection  job.
                 It  is  a  unique, fully qualified identifier for the job. It
                 includes the AWS account, Region, and the job ID. The  format
                 of the ARN is as follows:
                     arn:<partition>:comprehend:<region>:<account-id>:top-
                     ics-detection-job/<job-id>

                 The following is an example job ARN:
                     arn:aws:comprehend:us-west-2:111122223333:topics-detec-
                     tion-job/1234abcd12ab34cd56ef1234567890ab

              JobName -> (string)
                 The name of the topic detection job.

              JobStatus -> (string)
                 The  current status of the topic detection job. If the status
                 is Failed , the reason for the failure is shown in  the  Mes-
                 sage field.

              Message -> (string)
                 A description for the status of a job.

              SubmitTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time that the topic detection job was submitted for pro-
                 cessing.

              EndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the topic detection job was completed.

              InputDataConfig -> (structure)
                 The input data configuration supplied when  you  created  the
                 topic detection job.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     The  Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The URI must be in
                     same region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The
                     URI  can  point  to a single input file or it can provide
                     the prefix for a collection of data files.

                     For example, if you use the URI S3://bucketName/prefix  ,
                     if  the  prefix  is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses
                     that file as input. If more than one file begins with the
                     prefix, Amazon Comprehend uses all of them as input.

                 InputFormat -> (string)
                     Specifies  how  the  text in an input file should be pro-
                     cessed:

                     o ONE_DOC_PER_FILE - Each file is considered  a  separate
                       document. Use this option when you are processing large
                       documents, such as  newspaper  articles  or  scientific
                       papers.

                     o ONE_DOC_PER_LINE  - Each line in a file is considered a
                       separate document. Use this option when  you  are  pro-
                       cessing many short documents, such as text messages.

                 DocumentReaderConfig -> (structure)
                     The  document reader config field applies only for Input-
                     DataConfig of StartEntitiesDetectionJob.

                     Use DocumentReaderConfig to provide specifications  about
                     how  you want your inference documents read. Currently it
                     applies for PDF  documents  in  StartEntitiesDetectionJob
                     custom inference.

                     DocumentReadAction -> (string)
                        This  enum field will start with two values which will
                        apply to PDFs:

                        o TEXTRACT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_TEXT -  The  service  calls
                          DetectDocumentText for PDF documents per page.

                        o TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT  -  The service calls Ana-
                          lyzeDocument for PDF documents per page.

                     DocumentReadMode -> (string)
                        This enum field provides two values:

                        o SERVICE_DEFAULT - use service defaults for  Document
                          reading.  For  Digital  PDF  it  would mean using an
                          internal parser instead of Textract APIs

                        o FORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION -  Always  use  specified
                          action  for  DocumentReadAction,  including  Digital
                          PDF.

                     FeatureTypes -> (list)
                        Specifies how the text in an input file should be pro-
                        cessed:

                        (string)
                            A  list  of the types of analyses to perform. This
                            field specifies what  feature  types  need  to  be
                            extracted  from the document where entity recogni-
                            tion is expected.

                            o TABLES - Add TABLES to the list to return infor-
                              mation about the tables that are detected in the
                              input document.

                            o FORMS - Add FORMS to return detected form  data.

              OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
                 The  output  data configuration supplied when you created the
                 topic detection job.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     When you use the OutputDataConfig object  with  asynchro-
                     nous operations, you specify the Amazon S3 location where
                     you want to write the output data. The URI must be in the
                     same region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The
                     location is used as the prefix for the actual location of
                     the output file.

                     When  the  topic  detection  job is finished, the service
                     creates an output file in a  directory  specific  to  the
                     job.  The S3Uri field contains the location of the output
                     file, called output.tar.gz . It is a  compressed  archive
                     that contains the ouput of the operation.

                 KmsKeyId -> (string)
                     ID for the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key that Ama-
                     zon Comprehend uses to encrypt the output results from an
                     analysis  job.  The  KmsKeyId can be one of the following
                     formats:

                     o KMS Key ID: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                     o Amazon   Resource   Name   (ARN)   of   a   KMS    Key:

                 attached to the ML compute instance(s) that process the anal-
                 ysis job. The VolumeKmsKeyId can be either of  the  following
                 formats:

                 o KMS Key ID: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                 o Amazon    Resource    Name    (ARN)    of    a   KMS   Key:
                   "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

              VpcConfig -> (structure)

                 SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                     The ID number for a security group on an instance of your
                     private VPC. Security groups on your VPC  function  serve
                     as  a  virtual  firewall  to control inbound and outbound
                     traffic and provides  security  for  the  resources  that
                     youll be accessing on the VPC. This ID number is preceded
                     by "sg-", for instance: "sg-03b388029b0a285ea". For  more
