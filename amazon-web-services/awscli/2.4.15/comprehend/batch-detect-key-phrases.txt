NAME
       batch-detect-key-phrases -

DESCRIPTION
       Detects the key noun phrases found in a batch of documents.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-detect-key-phrases
          --text-list <value>
          --language-code <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --text-list (list)
          A list containing the text of the input documents. The list can con-
          tain a maximum of 25 documents. Each  document  must  contain  fewer
          that 5,000 bytes of UTF-8 encoded characters.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --language-code (string)
          The language of the input documents. You can specify any of the pri-
          mary languages supported by Amazon Comprehend. All documents must be
          in the same language.

          Possible values:

          o en

          o es

          o fr

          o de

          o it

          o pt

          o ar

          o hi

          o ja

          o ko

          o zh

          o zh-TW

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ResultList -> (list)
          A  list  of  objects  containing  the  results of the operation. The
          results are sorted in ascending order by the Index field  and  match
          the  order  of  the documents in the input list. If all of the docu-
          ments contain an error, the ResultList is empty.

          (structure)
              The result of calling the operation. The operation  returns  one
              object  for  each document that is successfully processed by the
              operation.

              Index -> (integer)
                 The zero-based index of the document in the input list.

              KeyPhrases -> (list)
                 One or more  KeyPhrase  objects,  one  for  each  key  phrase
                 detected in the document.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a key noun phrase.

                     Score -> (float)
                        The  level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend has in
                        the accuracy of the detection.

                     Text -> (string)
                        The text of a key noun phrase.

                     BeginOffset -> (integer)
                        A character offset in the input text that shows  where
                        the key phrase begins (the first character is at posi-
                        tion 0). The offset returns the position of each UTF-8
                        code point in the string. A code point is the abstract
                        character from a particular graphical  representation.
                        For  example,  a  multi-byte UTF-8 character maps to a
                        single code point.

                     EndOffset -> (integer)
                        A character offset in the input  text  where  the  key
                        phrase  ends.  The offset returns the position of each
                        UTF-8 code point in the string. A code  point  is  the
                        abstract  character from a particular graphical repre-
                        sentation. For example, a multi-byte  UTF-8  character
                        maps to a single code point.

       ErrorList -> (list)
          A  list  containing  one  object for each document that contained an
          error. The results are sorted in ascending order by the Index  field
          and match the order of the documents in the input list. If there are
          no errors in the batch, the ErrorList is empty.

          (structure)
              Describes an error that occurred while processing a document  in
              a batch. The operation returns on BatchItemError object for each
              document that contained an error.

              Index -> (integer)
                 The zero-based index of the document in the input list.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 The numeric error code of the error.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 A text description of the error.
