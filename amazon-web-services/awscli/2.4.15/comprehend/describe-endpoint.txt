DESCRIBE-ENDPOINT()                                        DESCRIBE-ENDPOINT()



NAME
       describe-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the properties associated with a specific endpoint. Use this oper-
       ation to get the status of an endpoint.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-endpoint
          --endpoint-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --endpoint-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the endpoint being described.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EndpointProperties -> (structure)
          Describes information associated with the specific endpoint.

          EndpointArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the endpoint.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the status  of  the  endpoint.  Because  the  endpoint
              updates and creation are asynchronous, so customers will need to
              wait for the endpoint to be Ready status before making inference
              requests.

          Message -> (string)
              Specifies a reason for failure in cases of Failed status.

          ModelArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the model to which the end-
              point is attached.

          DesiredModelArn -> (string)
              ARN of the new model to use for updating an  existing  endpoint.
              This  ARN  is  going to be different from the model ARN when the
              update is in progress

          DesiredInferenceUnits -> (integer)
              The desired number of inference units to be used  by  the  model
              using  this  endpoint.  Each  inference  unit  represents  of  a
              throughput of 100 characters per second.

          CurrentInferenceUnits -> (integer)
              The number of inference units currently used by the model  using
              this endpoint.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              The creation date and time of the endpoint.

          LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the endpoint was last modified.

          DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the AWS identity and Access
              Management (IAM) role that grants Amazon Comprehend read  access
              to  trained  custom models encrypted with a customer managed key
              (ModelKmsKeyId).

          DesiredDataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              Data access role ARN to use in case the new model  is  encrypted
              with a customer KMS key.
