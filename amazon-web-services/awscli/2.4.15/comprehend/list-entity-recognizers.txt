LIST-ENTITY-RECOGNIZERS()                            LIST-ENTITY-RECOGNIZERS()



NAME
       list-entity-recognizers -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a  list of the properties of all entity recognizers that you cre-
       ated, including recognizers currently in training. Allows you to filter
       the list of recognizers based on criteria such as status and submission
       time. This call returns up to 500 entity recognizers in the list,  with
       a default number of 100 recognizers in the list.

       The  results  of  this list are not in any particular order. Please get
       the list and sort locally if needed.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-entity-recognizers is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: EntityRecognizerPropertiesList

SYNOPSIS
            list-entity-recognizers
          [--filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filter (structure)
          Filters  the  list  of entities returned. You can filter on Status ,
          SubmitTimeBefore , or SubmitTimeAfter . You can only set one  filter
          at a time.

          Status -> (string)
              The status of an entity recognizer.

          RecognizerName -> (string)
              The name that you assigned the entity recognizer.

          SubmitTimeBefore -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of entities based on the time that the list was
              submitted for processing. Returns only jobs submitted before the
              specified time. Jobs are returned in descending order, newest to
              oldest.

          SubmitTimeAfter -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of entities based on the time that the list was
              submitted  for processing. Returns only jobs submitted after the
              specified time. Jobs are returned in ascending order, oldest  to
              newest.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Status=string,RecognizerName=string,SubmitTimeBefore=timestamp,SubmitTimeAfter=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Status": "SUBMITTED"|"TRAINING"|"DELETING"|"STOP_REQUESTED"|"STOPPED"|"IN_ERROR"|"TRAINED",
            "RecognizerName": "string",
            "SubmitTimeBefore": timestamp,
            "SubmitTimeAfter": timestamp
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EntityRecognizerPropertiesList -> (list)
          The list of properties of an entity recognizer.

          (structure)

              EntityRecognizerArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  that  identifies  the  entity
                 recognizer.

              LanguageCode -> (string)
                 The language of the input documents. All documents must be in
                 the same language. Only  English  ("en")  is  currently  sup-
                 ported.

              Status -> (string)
                 Provides the status of the entity recognizer.

              SubmitTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the recognizer was submitted for processing.

              EndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the recognizer creation completed.

              TrainingStartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that training of the entity recognizer started.

              TrainingEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  that  training  of  the entity recognizer was com-
                 pleted.

              InputDataConfig -> (structure)
                 The input data properties of an entity recognizer.

                 DataFormat -> (string)
                     The format of your training data:

                     o COMPREHEND_CSV :  A  CSV  file  that  supplements  your
                       training  documents.  The CSV file contains information
                       about the custom entities that your trained model  will
                       detect.  The  required  format  of  the file depends on
                       whether you are  providing  annotations  or  an  entity
                       list.  If you use this value, you must provide your CSV
                       file by using  either  the  Annotations  or  EntityList
                       parameters. You must provide your training documents by
                       using the Documents parameter.

                     o AUGMENTED_MANIFEST : A labeled dataset that is produced
                       by  Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth. This file is in JSON
                       lines format. Each line is a complete JSON object  that
                       contains a training document and its labels. Each label
                       annotates a named entity in the training document.   If
                       you use this value, you must provide the AugmentedMani-
                       fests parameter in your request.

                     If you don't specify a value, Amazon Comprehend uses COM-
                     PREHEND_CSV as the default.

                 EntityTypes -> (list)
                     The entity types in the labeled training data that Amazon
                     Comprehend uses to train the  custom  entity  recognizer.
                     Any entity types that you don't specify are ignored.

                     A  maximum  of 25 entity types can be used at one time to
                     train an entity recognizer. Entity types must not contain
                     the  following  invalid  characters:  n  (line break), \n
                     (escaped line break), r (carriage  return),  \r  (escaped
                     carriage return), t (tab), \t (escaped tab), space, and ,
                     (comma).

                     (structure)
                        An entity type within a labeled training dataset  that
                        Amazon Comprehend uses to train a custom entity recog-
                        nizer.

                        Type -> (string)
                            An entity type within a labeled  training  dataset
                            that  Amazon  Comprehend  uses  to  train a custom
                            entity recognizer.

                            Entity  types  must  not  contain  the   following
                            invalid  characters:  n  (line break), \n (escaped
                            line break, r (carriage return), \r (escaped  car-
                            riage  return),  t (tab), \t (escaped tab), space,
                            and , (comma).

                 Documents -> (structure)
                     The S3 location of the folder that contains the  training
                     documents for your custom entity recognizer.

                     This  parameter is required if you set DataFormat to COM-
                     PREHEND_CSV .

                     S3Uri -> (string)
                        Specifies the Amazon S3 location  where  the  training
                        documents  for  an  entity recognizer are located. The
                        URI must be in the same region  as  the  API  endpoint
                        that you are calling.

                     TestS3Uri -> (string)
                        Specifies  the Amazon S3 location where the test docu-
                        ments for an entity recognizer are  located.  The  URI
                        must  be  in  the  same AWS Region as the API endpoint
                        that you are calling.

                     InputFormat -> (string)
                        Specifies how the text in an input file should be pro-
                        cessed.   This   is   optional,  and  the  default  is
                        ONE_DOC_PER_LINE. ONE_DOC_PER_FILE - Each file is con-
                        sidered  a separate document. Use this option when you
                        are processing  large  documents,  such  as  newspaper
                        articles or scientific papers. ONE_DOC_PER_LINE - Each
                        line in a file is considered a separate document.  Use
                        this  option  when you are processing many short docu-
                        ments, such as text messages.

                 Annotations -> (structure)
                     The S3 location of  the  CSV  file  that  annotates  your
                     training documents.

                     S3Uri -> (string)
                        Specifies the Amazon S3 location where the annotations
                        for an entity recognizer are located. The URI must  be
                        in  the  same  region as the API endpoint that you are
                        calling.

                     TestS3Uri -> (string)
                        This specifies the Amazon S3 location where  the  test
                        annotations  for an entity recognizer are located. The
                        URI must be in the same AWS Region as the API endpoint
                        that you are calling.

                 EntityList -> (structure)
                     The  S3 location of the CSV file that has the entity list
                     for your custom entity recognizer.

                     S3Uri -> (string)
                        Specifies the Amazon S3 location where the entity list
                        is  located. The URI must be in the same region as the

                 AugmentedManifests -> (list)
                     A list of augmented manifest files that provide  training
                     data for your custom model. An augmented manifest file is
                     a labeled dataset that is produced  by  Amazon  SageMaker
                     Ground Truth.

                     This  parameter is required if you set DataFormat to AUG-
                     MENTED_MANIFEST .

                     (structure)
                        An augmented manifest file that provides training data
                        for your custom model. An augmented manifest file is a
                        labeled dataset that is produced by  Amazon  SageMaker
                        Ground Truth.

                        S3Uri -> (string)
                            The  Amazon  S3 location of the augmented manifest
                            file.

                        Split -> (string)
                            The purpose of the data  you've  provided  in  the
                            augmented  manifest.  You can either train or test
                            this data. If you don't specify,  the  default  is
                            train.

                            TRAIN  - all of the documents in the manifest will
                            be used for training. If  no  test  documents  are
                            provided,  Amazon  Comprehend  will  automatically
                            reserve a portion of the  training  documents  for
                            testing.

                            TEST  -  all of the documents in the manifest will
                            be used for testing.

                        AttributeNames -> (list)
                            The JSON attribute that contains  the  annotations
                            for   your   training  documents.  The  number  of
                            attribute  names  that  you  specify  depends   on
                            whether your augmented manifest file is the output
                            of a single labeling job  or  a  chained  labeling
                            job.

                            If  your  file  is the output of a single labeling
                            job, specify the LabelAttributeName key  that  was
                            used when the job was created in Ground Truth.

                            If  your  file is the output of a chained labeling
                            job, specify the LabelAttributeName key for one or
                            more  jobs  in  the chain. Each LabelAttributeName
                            key provides the annotations  from  an  individual
                            job.

                            (string)

                        AnnotationDataS3Uri -> (string)
                            The  S3  prefix  to  the annotation files that are
                            referred in the augmented manifest file.

                        SourceDocumentsS3Uri -> (string)
                            The S3 prefix to the source files (PDFs) that  are
                            referred to in the augmented manifest file.

                        DocumentType -> (string)
                            The  type of augmented manifest. PlainTextDocument
                            or SemiStructuredDocument. If you  don't  specify,
                            the default is PlainTextDocument.

                            o PLAIN_TEXT_DOCUMENT  A document type that repre-
                              sents any unicode text that is encoded in UTF-8.

                            o SEMI_STRUCTURED_DOCUMENT  A  document  type with
                              positional and structural context, like  a  PDF.
                              For  training  with Amazon Comprehend, only PDFs
                              are supported. For inference, Amazon  Comprehend
                              support PDFs, DOCX and TXT.

              RecognizerMetadata -> (structure)
                 Provides information about an entity recognizer.

                 NumberOfTrainedDocuments -> (integer)
                     The  number of documents in the input data that were used
                     to train the entity recognizer. Typically this is  80  to
                     90 percent of the input documents.

                 NumberOfTestDocuments -> (integer)
                     The  number of documents in the input data that were used
                     to test the entity recognizer. Typically this is 10 to 20

                 EvaluationMetrics -> (structure)
                     Detailed information about the accuracy of an entity rec-
                     ognizer.

                     Precision -> (double)
                        A measure of the usefulness of the recognizer  results
                        in the test data. High precision means that the recog-
                        nizer returned  substantially  more  relevant  results
                        than irrelevant ones.

                     Recall -> (double)
                        A  measure  of how complete the recognizer results are
                        for the test data. High recall means that  the  recog-
                        nizer returned most of the relevant results.

                     F1Score -> (double)
                        A  measure  of how accurate the recognizer results are
                        for the test data. It is derived  from  the  Precision
                        and Recall values. The F1Score is the harmonic average
                        of the two scores. The highest score  is  1,  and  the
                        worst score is 0.

                        Individual  item  from the list of entity types in the
                        metadata of an entity recognizer.

                        Type -> (string)
                            Type of entity from the list of  entity  types  in
                            the metadata of an entity recognizer.

                        EvaluationMetrics -> (structure)
                            Detailed  information  about  the  accuracy of the
                            entity recognizer for a specific item on the  list
                            of entity types.

                            Precision -> (double)
                               A  measure  of the usefulness of the recognizer
                               results for a specific entity type in the  test
                               data.  High precision means that the recognizer
                               returned substantially  more  relevant  results
                               than irrelevant ones.

                            Recall -> (double)
                               A   measure  of  how  complete  the  recognizer
                               results are for a specific entity type  in  the
                               test  data.  High  recall means that the recog-
                               nizer returned most of the relevant results.

                            F1Score -> (double)
                               A  measure  of  how  accurate  the   recognizer
                               results  are  for a specific entity type in the
                               test data. It is derived from the Precision and
                               Recall  values.  The  F1Score  is  the harmonic
                               average of the two scores. The highest score is
                               1, and the worst score is 0.
