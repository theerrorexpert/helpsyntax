DETECT-PII-ENTITIES()                                    DETECT-PII-ENTITIES()



NAME
       detect-pii-entities -

DESCRIPTION
       Inspects  the input text for entities that contain personally identifi-
       able information (PII) and returns information about them.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            detect-pii-entities
          --text <value>
          --language-code <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --text (string)
          A UTF-8 text string. Each string must contain fewer that 5,000 bytes
          of UTF-8 encoded characters.

       --language-code (string)
          The language of the input documents.

          Possible values:

          o en

          o es

          o fr

          o de

          o it

          o pt

          o ar

          o hi

          o ja

          o ko

          o zh

          o zh-TW

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Entities -> (list)
          A  collection of PII entities identified in the input text. For each
          entity, the response provides the entity type, where the entity text
          begins  and ends, and the level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend
          has in the detection.

          (structure)
              Provides information about a PII entity.

              Score -> (float)
                 The level of confidence that Amazon  Comprehend  has  in  the
                 accuracy of the detection.

              Type -> (string)
                 The entity's type.

              BeginOffset -> (integer)
                 A character offset in the input text that shows where the PII
                 entity begins (the first character is  at  position  0).  The
                 offset  returns  the position of each UTF-8 code point in the
                 string. A code point is the abstract character from a partic-
                 ular  graphical  representation.  For  example,  a multi-byte
                 UTF-8 character maps to a single code point.

              EndOffset -> (integer)
                 A character offset in the input text that shows where the PII
                 entity  ends.  The  offset returns the position of each UTF-8
                 code point in the string. A code point is the abstract  char-
                 acter  from  a particular graphical representation. For exam-
                 ple, a multi-byte UTF-8  character  maps  to  a  single  code
                 point.
