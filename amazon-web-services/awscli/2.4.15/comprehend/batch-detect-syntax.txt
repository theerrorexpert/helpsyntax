NAME
       batch-detect-syntax -

DESCRIPTION
       Inspects  the  text  of a batch of documents for the syntax and part of
       speech of the words in the document and returns information about them.
       For more information, see  how-syntax .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-detect-syntax
          --text-list <value>
          --language-code <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --text-list (list)
          A list containing the text of the input documents. The list can con-
          tain a maximum of 25 documents. Each  document  must  contain  fewer
          that 5,000 bytes of UTF-8 encoded characters.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --language-code (string)
          The language of the input documents. You can specify any of the fol-
          lowing languages supported  by  Amazon  Comprehend:  German  ("de"),
          English  ("en"),  Spanish  ("es"), French ("fr"), Italian ("it"), or
          Portuguese ("pt"). All documents must be in the same language.

          Possible values:

          o en

          o es

          o fr

          o de

          o it

          o pt

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ResultList -> (list)
          A list of objects containing  the  results  of  the  operation.  The
          results  are  sorted in ascending order by the Index field and match
          the order of the documents in the input list. If all  of  the  docu-
          ments contain an error, the ResultList is empty.

          (structure)
              The  result  of calling the operation. The operation returns one
              object that is successfully processed by the operation.

              Index -> (integer)
                 The zero-based index of the document in the input list.

              SyntaxTokens -> (list)
                 The syntax tokens for the words in the  document,  one  token
                 for each word.

                 (structure)
                     Represents  a  work in the input text that was recognized
                     and assigned a part of speech. There is one syntax  token
                     record for each word in the source text.

                     TokenId -> (integer)
                        A unique identifier for a token.

                     Text -> (string)
                        The word that was recognized in the source text.

                     BeginOffset -> (integer)
                        The zero-based offset from the beginning of the source
                        text to the first character in the word.

                     EndOffset -> (integer)
                        The zero-based offset from the beginning of the source
                        text to the last character in the word.

                     PartOfSpeech -> (structure)
                        Provides  the  part of speech label and the confidence
                        level that Amazon Comprehend  has  that  the  part  of
                        speech was correctly identified. For more information,
                        see  how-syntax .

                        Tag -> (string)
                            Identifies the part of speech that the token  rep-
                            resents.

                        Score -> (float)
                            The confidence that Amazon Comprehend has that the
                            part of speech was correctly identified.

       ErrorList -> (list)
          A list containing one object for each  document  that  contained  an
          error.  The results are sorted in ascending order by the Index field
          and match the order of the documents in the input list. If there are
          no errors in the batch, the ErrorList is empty.

          (structure)
              Describes  an error that occurred while processing a document in
              a batch. The operation returns on BatchItemError object for each
              document that contained an error.

              Index -> (integer)
                 The zero-based index of the document in the input list.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 The numeric error code of the error.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 A text description of the error.
