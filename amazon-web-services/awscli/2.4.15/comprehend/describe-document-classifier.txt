NAME
       describe-document-classifier -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the properties associated with a document classifier.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-document-classifier
          --document-classifier-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --document-classifier-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the document classi-
          fier. The operation returns this identifier in its response.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DocumentClassifierProperties -> (structure)
          An object that contains the properties associated  with  a  document
          classifier.

          DocumentClassifierArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  that identifies the document
              classifier.

          LanguageCode -> (string)
              The language code for the language of  the  documents  that  the
              classifier was trained on.

          Status -> (string)
              The  status of the document classifier. If the status is TRAINED
              the classifier is ready to use. If the status is FAILED you  can
              see  additional  information  about  why  the  classifier wasn't
              trained in the Message field.

          Message -> (string)
              Additional information about the status of the classifier.

          SubmitTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the document classifier was submitted  for  train-
              ing.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that training the document classifier completed.

          TrainingStartTime -> (timestamp)
              Indicates  the  time  when  the training starts on documentation
              classifiers. You are billed for the time interval  between  this
              time and the value of TrainingEndTime.

          TrainingEndTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that training of the document classifier was completed.
              Indicates the time when the training completes on  documentation
              classifiers.  You  are billed for the time interval between this
              time and the value of TrainingStartTime.

          InputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The input data configuration that you supplied when you  created
              the document classifier for training.

              DataFormat -> (string)
                 The format of your training data:

                 o COMPREHEND_CSV  :  A  two-column CSV file, where labels are
                   provided in the first column, and documents are provided in
                   the  second.  If  you  use this value, you must provide the
                   S3Uri parameter in your request.

                 o AUGMENTED_MANIFEST : A labeled dataset that is produced  by
                   Amazon  SageMaker  Ground Truth. This file is in JSON lines
                   format. Each line is a complete JSON object that contains a
                   training  document  and  its associated labels.  If you use
                   this value, you must provide the AugmentedManifests parame-
                   ter in your request.

                 If  you don't specify a value, Amazon Comprehend uses COMPRE-
                 HEND_CSV as the default.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The S3 bucket  must  be
                 in  the same region as the API endpoint that you are calling.
                 The URI can point to a single input file or  it  can  provide
                 the prefix for a collection of input files.

                 For  example,  if you use the URI S3://bucketName/prefix , if
                 the prefix is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses that file
                 as  input. If more than one file begins with the prefix, Ama-
                 zon Comprehend uses all of them as input.

                 This parameter is required if you set DataFormat  to  COMPRE-
                 HEND_CSV .

              TestS3Uri -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  S3  URI for the input data. The Amazon S3 bucket
                 must be in the same AWS Region as the API endpoint  that  you
                 are  calling.  The URI can point to a single input file or it
                 can provide the prefix for a collection of input files.

              LabelDelimiter -> (string)
                 Indicates the delimiter  used  to  separate  each  label  for
                 training  a  multi-label  classifier.  The  default delimiter
                 between labels is a pipe (|). You can use a different charac-
                 ter as a delimiter (if it's an allowed character) by specify-
                 ing it under Delimiter for labels. If the training  documents
                 use  a  delimiter other than the default or the delimiter you
                 specify, the labels on that line will be combined to  make  a
                 single unique label, such as LABELLABELLABEL.

              AugmentedManifests -> (list)
                 A list of augmented manifest files that provide training data
                 for your custom  model.  An  augmented  manifest  file  is  a
                 labeled  dataset  that is produced by Amazon SageMaker Ground
                 Truth.

                 This parameter is required if  you  set  DataFormat  to  AUG-
                 MENTED_MANIFEST .

                 (structure)
                     An  augmented  manifest  file that provides training data
                     for your custom model. An augmented manifest  file  is  a
                     labeled  dataset  that  is  produced  by Amazon SageMaker
                     Ground Truth.

                     S3Uri -> (string)
                        The Amazon S3 location of the augmented manifest file.

                     Split -> (string)
                        The  purpose  of  the data you've provided in the aug-
                        mented manifest. You can either  train  or  test  this
                        data. If you don't specify, the default is train.

                        TRAIN  -  all of the documents in the manifest will be
                        used for training. If no test documents are  provided,
                        Amazon Comprehend will automatically reserve a portion
                        of the training documents for testing.

                        TEST - all of the documents in the  manifest  will  be
                        used for testing.

                     AttributeNames -> (list)
                        The  JSON  attribute that contains the annotations for
                        your training documents. The number of attribute names
                        that  you  specify  depends  on whether your augmented
                        manifest file is the output of a single  labeling  job
                        or a chained labeling job.

                        If  your  file is the output of a single labeling job,
                        specify the LabelAttributeName key that was used  when
                        the job was created in Ground Truth.

                        If  your file is the output of a chained labeling job,
                        specify the LabelAttributeName key  for  one  or  more
                        jobs  in  the  chain. Each LabelAttributeName key pro-
                        vides the annotations from an individual job.

                        (string)

                     AnnotationDataS3Uri -> (string)
                        The  S3  prefix  to  the  annotation  files  that  are
                        referred in the augmented manifest file.

                     SourceDocumentsS3Uri -> (string)
                        The  S3  prefix  to  the  source files (PDFs) that are
                        referred to in the augmented manifest file.

                     DocumentType -> (string)
                        The type of augmented manifest.  PlainTextDocument  or
                        SemiStructuredDocument.  If  you  don't  specify,  the
                        default is PlainTextDocument.

                        o PLAIN_TEXT_DOCUMENT A document type that  represents
                          any unicode text that is encoded in UTF-8.

                        o SEMI_STRUCTURED_DOCUMENT  A document type with posi-
                          tional and  structural  context,  like  a  PDF.  For
                          training  with Amazon Comprehend, only PDFs are sup-
                          ported. For  inference,  Amazon  Comprehend  support
                          PDFs, DOCX and TXT.

          OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
              Provides  output  results  configuration  parameters  for custom
              classifier jobs.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 When you use the OutputDataConfig  object  while  creating  a
                 custom  classifier,  you specify the Amazon S3 location where
                 you want to write the confusion matrix. The URI  must  be  in
                 the same region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The
                 location is used as the prefix for  the  actual  location  of
                 this output file.

                 When  the custom classifier job is finished, the service cre-
                 ates the output file in a directory specific to the job.  The
                 S3Uri  field contains the location of the output file, called
                 output.tar.gz . It is a compressed archive that contains  the
                 confusion matrix.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 ID  for  the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key that Amazon
                 Comprehend uses to encrypt the output results from an  analy-
                 sis job. The KmsKeyId can be one of the following formats:

                 o KMS Key ID: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                 o Amazon    Resource    Name    (ARN)    of    a   KMS   Key:
                   "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

                 o KMS Key Alias: "alias/ExampleAlias"

                 o ARN         of        a        KMS        Key        Alias:
                   "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias"

          ClassifierMetadata -> (structure)
              Information about the document classifier, including the  number
              of  documents  used  for  training the classifier, the number of
              documents used for test the classifier, and an accuracy  rating.

              NumberOfLabels -> (integer)
                 The number of labels in the input data.

              NumberOfTrainedDocuments -> (integer)
                 The  number  of documents in the input data that were used to
                 train the classifier. Typically this is 80 to 90  percent  of
                 the input documents.

              NumberOfTestDocuments -> (integer)
                 The  number  of documents in the input data that were used to
                 test the classifier. Typically this is 10 to  20  percent  of
                 the input documents, up to 10,000 documents.

              EvaluationMetrics -> (structure)
                 Describes  the  result  metrics  for the test data associated
                 with an documentation classifier.

                 Accuracy -> (double)
                     The fraction of the labels that were correct  recognized.
                     It  is  computed  by dividing the number of labels in the
                     test documents that  were  correctly  recognized  by  the
                     total number of labels in the test documents.

                 Precision -> (double)
                     A  measure of the usefulness of the classifier results in
                     the test data. High precision means that  the  classifier
                     returned substantially more relevant results than irrele-
                     vant ones.

                 Recall -> (double)
                     A measure of how complete the classifier results are  for
                     the  test  data.  High  recall  means that the classifier
                     returned most of the relevant results.

                 F1Score -> (double)
                     A measure of how accurate the classifier results are  for
                     the  test  data.  It  is  derived  from the Precision and
                     Recall values. The F1Score is the harmonic average of the
                     two  scores.  The highest score is 1, and the worst score
                     is 0.

                 MicroPrecision -> (double)
                     A measure of the usefulness of the recognizer results  in
                     the  test  data. High precision means that the recognizer
                     returned substantially more relevant results than irrele-
                     vant  ones.  Unlike the Precision metric which comes from
                     averaging the precision of all available labels, this  is
                     based  on the overall score of all precision scores added
                     together.

                 MicroRecall -> (double)
                     A measure of how complete the classifier results are  for
                     the  test  data.  High  recall  means that the classifier
                     returned most of the relevant results. Specifically, this
                     indicates  how many of the correct categories in the text
                     that the model can predict. It is a percentage of correct
                     categories in the text that can found. Instead of averag-
                     ing the recall scores of all  labels  (as  with  Recall),
                     micro  Recall is based on the overall score of all recall
                     scores added together.

                 MicroF1Score -> (double)
                     A measure of how accurate the classifier results are  for
                     the test data. It is a combination of the Micro Precision
                     and Micro Recall values. The Micro F1Score  is  the  har-
                     monic mean of the two scores. The highest score is 1, and
                     the worst score is 0.

                 HammingLoss -> (double)
                     Indicates the fraction of  labels  that  are  incorrectly
                     predicted. Also seen as the fraction of wrong labels com-
                     pared to the total number of  labels.  Scores  closer  to
                     zero are better.

          DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and Manage-
              ment (IAM) role that grants Amazon  Comprehend  read  access  to
              your input data.

          VolumeKmsKeyId -> (string)
              ID for the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key that Amazon Com-
              prehend uses to encrypt data on the storage volume  attached  to
              the  ML  compute  instance(s) that process the analysis job. The
              VolumeKmsKeyId can be either of the following formats:

              o KMS Key ID: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

              o Amazon    Resource    Name    (ARN)    of    a    KMS     Key:
                "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

          VpcConfig -> (structure)
              Configuration parameters for a  private  Virtual  Private  Cloud
              (VPC)  containing  the  resources  you are using for your custom
              classifier. For more information, see Amazon VPC .

              SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                 The ID number for a security group on  an  instance  of  your
                 private  VPC. Security groups on your VPC function serve as a
                 virtual firewall to control inbound and outbound traffic  and
                 provides  security  for the resources that youll be accessing
                 on the  VPC.  This  ID  number  is  preceded  by  "sg-",  for
                 instance:  "sg-03b388029b0a285ea".  For more information, see
                 Security Groups for your VPC .

                 (string)

              Subnets -> (list)
                 The ID for each subnet being used in your private  VPC.  This
                 subnet  is  a subset of the a range of IPv4 addresses used by
                 the VPC and is specific to a given availability zone  in  the
                 VPCs  region.  This  ID  number is preceded by "subnet-", for
                 instance: "subnet-04ccf456919e69055". For  more  information,
                 see VPCs and Subnets .

                 (string)

          Mode -> (string)
              Indicates the mode in which the specific classifier was trained.
              This also indicates the format of input documents and the format
              of  the confusion matrix. Each classifier can only be trained in
              one mode and this cannot  be  changed  once  the  classifier  is
              trained.

          ModelKmsKeyId -> (string)
              ID for the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key that Amazon Com-
              prehend uses to encrypt trained custom models. The ModelKmsKeyId
              can be either of the following formats:

              o KMS Key ID: "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

              o Amazon     Resource    Name    (ARN)    of    a    KMS    Key:
                "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"

          VersionName -> (string)
              The version name that you assigned to the document classifier.
