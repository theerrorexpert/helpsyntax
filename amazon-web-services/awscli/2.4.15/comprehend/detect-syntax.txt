DETECT-SYNTAX()                                                DETECT-SYNTAX()



NAME
       detect-syntax -

DESCRIPTION
       Inspects  text  for syntax and the part of speech of words in the docu-
       ment. For more information,  how-syntax .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            detect-syntax
          --text <value>
          --language-code <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --text (string)
          A UTF-8 string. Each string must contain fewer that 5,000  bytes  of
          UTF encoded characters.

       --language-code (string)
          The language code of the input documents. You can specify any of the
          following languages supported by Amazon Comprehend:  German  ("de"),
          English  ("en"),  Spanish  ("es"), French ("fr"), Italian ("it"), or
          Portuguese ("pt").

          Possible values:

          o en

          o es

          o fr

          o de

          o it

          o pt

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SyntaxTokens -> (list)
          A collection of syntax tokens describing the text. For  each  token,
          the  response  provides  the  text,  the  token type, where the text
          begins and ends, and the level of confidence that Amazon  Comprehend
          has  that  the  token  is  correct.  For  a list of token types, see
          how-syntax .

          (structure)
              Represents a work in the input  text  that  was  recognized  and
              assigned  a part of speech. There is one syntax token record for
              each word in the source text.

              TokenId -> (integer)
                 A unique identifier for a token.

              Text -> (string)
                 The word that was recognized in the source text.

              BeginOffset -> (integer)
                 The zero-based offset from the beginning of the  source  text
                 to the first character in the word.

              EndOffset -> (integer)
                 The  zero-based  offset from the beginning of the source text
                 to the last character in the word.

              PartOfSpeech -> (structure)
                 Provides the part of speech label and  the  confidence  level
                 that  Amazon  Comprehend has that the part of speech was cor-
                 rectly identified. For more information, see  how-syntax .

                 Tag -> (string)
                     Identifies the part of speech that the token  represents.

                 Score -> (float)
                     The  confidence  that Amazon Comprehend has that the part
                     of speech was correctly identified.
