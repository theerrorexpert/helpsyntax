CREATE-ENDPOINT()                                            CREATE-ENDPOINT()



NAME
       create-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a model-specific endpoint for synchronous inference for a pre-
       viously trained custom model

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-endpoint
          --endpoint-name <value>
          --model-arn <value>
          --desired-inference-units <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--data-access-role-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --endpoint-name (string)
          This is the descriptive suffix that becomes part of the  EndpointArn
          used for all subsequent requests to this resource.

       --model-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the model to which the endpoint
          will be attached.

       --desired-inference-units (integer)
          The desired number of inference units to be used by the model  using
          this endpoint. Each inference unit represents of a throughput of 100
          characters per second.

       --client-request-token (string)
          An idempotency token provided by the customer. If this token matches
          a  previous  endpoint  creation  request, Amazon Comprehend will not
          return a ResourceInUseException .

       --tags (list)
          Tags associated  with  the  endpoint  being  created.  A  tag  is  a
          key-value  pair  that  adds metadata to the endpoint. For example, a
          tag with "Sales" as the key might be added to an endpoint  to  indi-
          cate its use by the sales department.

          (structure)
              A  key-value  pair that adds as a metadata to a resource used by
              Amazon Comprehend. For example, a tag with  the  key-value  pair
              Department:Sales  might  be  added to a resource to indicate its
              use by a particular department.

              Key -> (string)
                 The initial part of a key-value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For instance, if you want to show
                 which resources are used by which departments, you might  use
                 Department as the key portion of the pair, with multiple pos-
                 sible values such as sales, legal, and administration.

              Value -> (string)
                 The second part of a key-value pair that forms a tag  associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For instance, if you want to show
                 which resources are used by which departments, you might  use
                 Department  as  the initial (key) portion of the pair, with a
                 value of sales to indicate the sales department.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --data-access-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS identity and  Access  Man-
          agement  (IAM)  role  that  grants  Amazon Comprehend read access to
          trained custom models encrypted with a customer  managed  key  (Mod-
          elKmsKeyId).

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EndpointArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the endpoint being created.
