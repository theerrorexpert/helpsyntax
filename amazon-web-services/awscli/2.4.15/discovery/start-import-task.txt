START-IMPORT-TASK()                                        START-IMPORT-TASK()



NAME
       start-import-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  an  import  task,  which  allows  you to import details of your
       on-premises environment directly into AWS Migration Hub without  having
       to  use  the Application Discovery Service (ADS) tools such as the Dis-
       covery Connector or Discovery Agent. This gives you the option to  per-
       form  migration  assessment  and  planning  directly from your imported
       data, including the ability to group your devices as  applications  and
       track their migration status.

       To start an import request, do this:

       o Download  the  specially formatted comma separated value (CSV) import
         template,        which        you        can        find        here:
         https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/templates-7cffcf56-bd96-4b1c-b45b-a5b42f282e46/import_template.csv
         .

       o Fill out the template with your server and application data.

       o Upload your import file to an Amazon S3 bucket, and make  a  note  of
         it's Object URL. Your import file must be in the CSV format.

       o Use  the  console  or the StartImportTask command with the AWS CLI or
         one of the AWS SDKs to import the records from your file.

       For more information, including step-by-step procedures, see  Migration
       Hub Import in the AWS Application Discovery Service User Guide .

       NOTE:
          There  are  limits to the number of import tasks you can create (and
          delete) in an AWS account. For more information, see AWS Application
          Discovery  Service  Limits  in the AWS Application Discovery Service
          User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            start-import-task
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          --name <value>
          --import-url <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-request-token (string)
          Optional. A unique token that you can provide to  prevent  the  same
          import request from occurring more than once. If you don't provide a
          token, a token is automatically generated.

          Sending more than one StartImportTask request with the  same  client
          request token will return information about the original import task
          with that client request token.

       --name (string)
          A descriptive name for this request. You can use this name to filter
          future  requests  related  to  this import task, such as identifying
          applications and servers that were included in this import task.  We
          recommend that you use a meaningful name for each import task.

       --import-url (string)
          The URL for your import file that you've uploaded to Amazon S3.

          NOTE:
              If  you're using the AWS CLI, this URL is structured as follows:
              s3://BucketName/ImportFileName.CSV

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       task -> (structure)
          An array of information related to the import task request including
          status  information,  times,  IDs,  the Amazon S3 Object URL for the
          import file, and more.

          importTaskId -> (string)
              The unique ID for a specific import task. These IDs aren't glob-
              ally unique, but they are unique within an AWS account.

          clientRequestToken -> (string)
              A  unique  token  used  to  prevent the same import request from
              occurring more than once. If you didn't provide a token, a token
              was  automatically  generated  when  the import task request was
              sent.

          name -> (string)
              A descriptive name for an import task. You can use this name  to
              filter  future  requests  related  to  this import task, such as
              identifying applications and servers that were included in  this
              import  task.  We  recommend  that you use a meaningful name for
              each import task.

          importUrl -> (string)
              The URL for your import file that you've uploaded to Amazon  S3.

          status -> (string)
              The  status of the import task. An import can have the status of
              IMPORT_COMPLETE and still have some records fail to import  from
              the  overall request. More information can be found in the down-
              loadable archive defined in the errorsAndFailedEntriesZip field,
              or in the Migration Hub management console.

          importRequestTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the import task request was made, presented in the
              Unix time stamp format.

          importCompletionTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the import task request finished, presented in the
              Unix time stamp format.

          importDeletedTime -> (timestamp)
              The  time that the import task request was deleted, presented in
              the Unix time stamp format.

          serverImportSuccess -> (integer)
              The total number of server records in the import file that  were
              successfully imported.

          serverImportFailure -> (integer)
              The  total  number  of  server  records  in the import file that
              failed to be imported.

          applicationImportSuccess -> (integer)
              The total number of application records in the import file  that
              were successfully imported.

          applicationImportFailure -> (integer)
              The  total number of application records in the import file that
              failed to be imported.

          errorsAndFailedEntriesZip -> (string)
              A link to a compressed archive folder (in the ZIP  format)  that
              contains  an error log and a file of failed records. You can use
              these two files to quickly identify  records  that  failed,  why
              they  failed,  and  correct  those  records.  Afterward, you can
              upload the corrected file to your Amazon S3  bucket  and  create
              another import task request.

              This  field  also  includes authorization information so you can
              confirm the authenticity of the compressed  archive  before  you
              download it.

              If some records failed to be imported we recommend that you cor-
              rect the records in the failed entries  file  and  then  imports
              that  failed entries file. This prevents you from having to cor-
              rect and update the larger original file and  attempt  importing
              it again.
