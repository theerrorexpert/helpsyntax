DESCRIBE-CONTINUOUS-EXPORTS()                    DESCRIBE-CONTINUOUS-EXPORTS()



NAME
       describe-continuous-exports -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  exports  as  specified  by ID. All continuous exports associated
       with your user account can be listed if you call  DescribeContinuousEx-
       ports as is without passing any parameters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-continuous-exports  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: descriptions

SYNOPSIS
            describe-continuous-exports
          [--export-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --export-ids (list)
          The unique IDs assigned to the exports.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       descriptions -> (list)
          A list of continuous export descriptions.

          (structure)
              A list of continuous export descriptions.

              exportId -> (string)
                 The unique ID assigned to this export.

              status -> (string)
                 Describes the status of the export. Can be one of the follow-
                 ing values:

                 o START_IN_PROGRESS - setting up resources to start  continu-

                 o START_FAILED  -  an  error  occurred  setting up continuous
                   export. To recover, call start-continuous-export again.

                 o ACTIVE - data is being exported to the customer bucket.

                 o ERROR - an error occurred during export. To fix the  issue,
                   call stop-continuous-export and start-continuous-export.

                 o STOP_IN_PROGRESS - stopping the export.

                 o STOP_FAILED  -  an  error  occurred stopping the export. To
                   recover, call stop-continuous-export again.

                 o INACTIVE - the continuous export has been stopped. Data  is
                   no longer being exported to the customer bucket.

              statusDetail -> (string)
                 Contains  information  about  any  errors that have occurred.

                 o ACCESS_DENIED - You dont  have  permission  to  start  Data
                   Exploration  in Amazon Athena. Contact your AWS administra-
                   tor for help. For more  information,  see  Setting  Up  AWS
                   Application  Discovery Service in the Application Discovery

                   again.  For more information, see Kinesis Data Streams Lim-
                   its in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide.

                   an  error state because your IAM User is missing the AWSAp-
                   plicationDiscoveryServiceFirehose role. Turn on Data Explo-
                   ration  in  Amazon  Athena and try again. For more informa-

                 o FIREHOSE_STREAM_DOES_NOT_EXIST - The Data Exploration  fea-
                   ture  is in an error state because your IAM User is missing
                   one or more of the Kinesis data delivery streams.

                 o INTERNAL_FAILURE - The Data Exploration feature  is  in  an
                   error  state  because  of  an  internal  failure. Try again
                   later. If this problem persists, contact AWS Support.

                 o S3_BUCKET_LIMIT_FAILURE - You reached the limit for  Amazon
                   S3  buckets.  Reduce  the  number  of  Amazon S3 buckets or
                   request a limit increase and try again. For  more  informa-
