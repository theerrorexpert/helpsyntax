LIST-SERVER-NEIGHBORS()                                LIST-SERVER-NEIGHBORS()



NAME
       list-server-neighbors -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a list of servers that are one network hop away from a speci-
       fied server.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-server-neighbors
          --configuration-id <value>
          [--port-information-needed | --no-port-information-needed]
          [--neighbor-configuration-ids <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --configuration-id (string)
          Configuration ID of the server for which neighbors are being listed.

       --port-information-needed | --no-port-information-needed (boolean)
          Flag  to indicate if port and protocol information is needed as part
          of the response.

       --neighbor-configuration-ids (list)
          List of configuration IDs to test for one-hop-away.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --max-results (integer)
          Maximum number of results to return in a single page of output.

       --next-token (string)
          Token to retrieve the next set of results. For example, if you  pre-
          viously  specified  100 IDs for ListServerNeighborsRequest$neighbor-
          ConfigurationIds but  set  ListServerNeighborsRequest$maxResults  to
          10,  you  received  a set of 10 results along with a token. Use that
          token in this query to get the next set of 10.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       neighbors -> (list)
          List of distinct servers that  are  one  hop  away  from  the  given
          server.

          (structure)
              Details about neighboring servers.

              sourceServerId -> (string)
                 The ID of the server that opened the network connection.

              destinationServerId -> (string)
                 The ID of the server that accepted the network connection.

              destinationPort -> (integer)
                 The destination network port for the connection.

              transportProtocol -> (string)
                 The network protocol used for the connection.

              connectionsCount -> (long)
                 The  number  of open network connections with the neighboring
                 server.

       nextToken -> (string)
          Token to retrieve the next set of results. For example, if you spec-
          ified   100  IDs  for  ListServerNeighborsRequest$neighborConfigura-
          tionIds but set  ListServerNeighborsRequest$maxResults  to  10,  you
          received  a  set of 10 results along with this token. Use this token
          in the next query to retrieve the next set of 10.

       knownDependencyCount -> (long)
          Count of distinct servers that are  one  hop  away  from  the  given
          server.
