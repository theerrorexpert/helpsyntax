BATCH-DELETE-IMPORT-DATA()                          BATCH-DELETE-IMPORT-DATA()



NAME
       batch-delete-import-data -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  one  or more import tasks, each identified by their import ID.
       Each import task has a number of records that can identify  servers  or
       applications.

       AWS Application Discovery Service has built-in matching logic that will
       identify when discovered servers match  existing  entries  that  you've
       previously discovered, the information for the already-existing discov-
       ered server is updated. When you delete an import  task  that  contains
       records  that  were  used  to  match,  the information in those matched
       records that comes from the deleted records will also be deleted.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-delete-import-data
          --import-task-ids <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --import-task-ids (list)
          The IDs for the import tasks that you want to delete.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       errors -> (list)

          (structure)
              Error messages returned for each import task that you deleted as
              a response for this command.

              importTaskId -> (string)
                 The unique import ID associated with the error that occurred.

              errorCode -> (string)
                 The type of error that occurred for a specific import task.

              errorDescription -> (string)
