NAME
       describe-import-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  an  array  of  import tasks for your account, including status
       information, times, IDs, the Amazon S3 Object URL for the import  file,
       and more.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-import-tasks
          [--filters <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          An  array of name-value pairs that you provide to filter the results
          for the DescribeImportTask request to a specific subset of  results.
          Currently, wildcard values aren't supported for filters.

          (structure)
              A name-values pair of elements you can use to filter the results
              when querying your import tasks. Currently,  wildcards  are  not
              supported for filters.

              NOTE:
                 When  filtering by import status, all other filter values are
                 ignored.

              name -> (string)
                 The name, status, or import task ID  for  a  specific  import
                 task.

              values -> (list)
                 An  array  of strings that you can provide to match against a
                 specific name, status,  or  import  task  ID  to  filter  the
                 results for your import task queries.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "IMPORT_TASK_ID"|"STATUS"|"NAME",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of results that you want this request to return,
          up to 100.

       --next-token (string)
          The token to request a specific page of results.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          The token to request the next page of results.

       tasks -> (list)
          A returned array of import tasks that match any applied filters,  up
          to the specified number of maximum results.

          (structure)
              An  array of information related to the import task request that
              includes status information, times, IDs, the  Amazon  S3  Object
              URL for the import file, and more.

              importTaskId -> (string)
                 The  unique  ID  for a specific import task. These IDs aren't
                 globally unique, but they are unique within an AWS account.

              clientRequestToken -> (string)
                 A unique token used to prevent the same import  request  from
                 occurring  more  than  once. If you didn't provide a token, a
                 token  was  automatically  generated  when  the  import  task
                 request was sent.

              name -> (string)
                 A  descriptive name for an import task. You can use this name
                 to filter future requests related to this import  task,  such
                 as identifying applications and servers that were included in
                 this import task. We recommend that you use a meaningful name
                 for each import task.

              importUrl -> (string)
                 The  URL  for your import file that you've uploaded to Amazon
                 S3.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the import task. An import can have the  status
                 of IMPORT_COMPLETE and still have some records fail to import
                 from the overall request. More information can  be  found  in
                 the  downloadable  archive  defined in the errorsAndFailedEn-
                 triesZip field, or in the Migration Hub management console.

              importRequestTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the import task request was made, presented  in
                 the Unix time stamp format.

              importCompletionTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time that the import task request finished, presented in
                 the Unix time stamp format.

              importDeletedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the import task request was deleted,  presented
                 in the Unix time stamp format.

              serverImportSuccess -> (integer)
                 The  total  number  of server records in the import file that
                 were successfully imported.

              serverImportFailure -> (integer)
                 The total number of server records in the  import  file  that
                 failed to be imported.

              applicationImportSuccess -> (integer)
                 The  total  number  of application records in the import file
                 that were successfully imported.

              applicationImportFailure -> (integer)
                 The total number of application records in  the  import  file
                 that failed to be imported.

              errorsAndFailedEntriesZip -> (string)
                 A  link  to  a  compressed archive folder (in the ZIP format)
                 that contains an error log and a file of failed records.  You
                 can  use  these  two  files  to quickly identify records that
                 failed, why they failed, and correct  those  records.  After-
                 ward,  you  can  upload  the corrected file to your Amazon S3
                 bucket and create another import task request.

                 This field also includes authorization information so you can
                 confirm the authenticity of the compressed archive before you
                 download it.

                 If some records failed to be imported we recommend  that  you
                 correct  the  records  in  the  failed  entries file and then
                 imports that failed entries file. This prevents you from hav-
                 ing  to  correct  and  update  the  larger  original file and
                 attempt importing it again.
