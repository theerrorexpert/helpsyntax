DESCRIBE-AGENTS()                                            DESCRIBE-AGENTS()



NAME
       describe-agents -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  agents  or  connectors  as specified by ID or other filters. All
       agents/connectors associated with your user account can  be  listed  if
       you call DescribeAgents as is without passing any parameters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-agents  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: agentsInfo

SYNOPSIS
            describe-agents
          [--agent-ids <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --agent-ids (list)
          The agent or the Connector IDs for which you  want  information.  If
          you  specify  no  IDs,  the  system  returns  information  about all
          agents/Connectors associated with your AWS user account.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          You can filter the request using various logical operators and a key
          -value format. For example:
              {"key": "collectionStatus", "value": "STARTED"}

          (structure)
              A filter that can use conditional operators.

              For more information about filters, see Querying Discovered Con-
              figuration Items in the AWS Application Discovery  Service  User
              Guide .

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

              values -> (list)
                 A string value on which to filter. For example, if you choose
                 the destinationServer.osVersion filter name, you could  spec-
                 ify Ubuntu for the value.

                 (string)

              condition -> (string)
                 A  conditional  operator.  The following operators are valid:
                 EQUALS, NOT_EQUALS, CONTAINS, NOT_CONTAINS.  If  you  specify
                 multiple  filters,  the system utilizes all filters as though
                 concatenated by AND . If you specify multiple  values  for  a
                 particular filter, the system differentiates the values using
                 OR . Calling either DescribeConfigurations or  ListConfigura-
                 tions returns attributes of matching configuration items.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string,condition=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "values": ["string", ...],
              "condition": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
