DESCRIBE-EXPORT-TASKS()                                DESCRIBE-EXPORT-TASKS()



NAME
       describe-export-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieve  status of one or more export tasks. You can retrieve the sta-
       tus of up to 100 export tasks.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-export-tasks is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: exportsInfo

SYNOPSIS
            describe-export-tasks
          [--export-ids <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --export-ids (list)
          One or more unique identifiers used to query the status of an export
          request.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          One or more filters.

          o AgentId - ID of the agent whose collected data will be exported

          (structure)
              Used to select which agent's data is to be  exported.  A  single
              agent  ID  may  be selected for export using the StartExportTask
              action.

              name -> (string)
                 A single ExportFilter name. Supported filters: agentId .

              values -> (list)
                 A single agentId for a Discovery Agent.  An  agentId  can  be
                 found using the DescribeAgents action. Typically an ADS agen-
                 tId is in the form o-0123456789abcdef0 .

                 (string)

              condition -> (string)
                 Supported condition: EQUALS

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string,condition=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "values": ["string", ...],
              "condition": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       exportsInfo -> (list)
          Contains one or more sets of export request details. When the status
          of a request is SUCCEEDED , the response includes a URL for an  Ama-
          zon S3 bucket where you can view the data in a CSV file.

          (structure)
              Information  regarding the export status of discovered data. The
              value is an array of objects.

              exportId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier used to query an export.

              exportStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the data export job.

              statusMessage -> (string)
                 A status message provided for API callers.

              configurationsDownloadUrl -> (string)
                 A URL for an Amazon  S3  bucket  where  you  can  review  the
                 exported  data.  The URL is displayed only if the export suc-
                 ceeded.

              exportRequestTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the data export was initiated.

              isTruncated -> (boolean)
                 If true, the export of agent information  exceeded  the  size
                 limit for a single export and the exported data is incomplete
                 for the requested time  range.  To  address  this,  select  a
                 smaller time range for the export by using startDate and end-
                 Date .

              requestedStartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The value  of  startTime  parameter  in  the  StartExportTask
                 request.  If no startTime was requested, this result does not
                 appear in ExportInfo .

              requestedEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The endTime used in the StartExportTask request. If  no  end-
                 Time was requested, this result does not appear in ExportInfo
                 .

       nextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken value  to  include  in  a  future  DescribeExportTasks
          request.  When  the  results of a DescribeExportTasks request exceed
          maxResults , this value can be used to retrieve  the  next  page  of
          results.  This  value  is  null  when  there  are no more results to
          return.
