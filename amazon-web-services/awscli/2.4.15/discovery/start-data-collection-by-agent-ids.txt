NAME

DESCRIPTION
       Instructs  the specified agents or connectors to start collecting data.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-data-collection-by-agent-ids
          --agent-ids <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --agent-ids (list)
          The IDs of the agents or connectors from which to  start  collecting
          data. If you send a request to an agent/connector ID that you do not
          have permission to contact, according to your AWS account, the  ser-
          vice  does  not throw an exception. Instead, it returns the error in
          the Description field. If you send a request to multiple agents/con-
          nectors  and  you  do  not  have permission to contact some of those
          agents/connectors, the system does not throw an exception.  Instead,
          the system shows Failed in the Description field.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       agentsConfigurationStatus -> (list)
          Information  about  agents  or the connector that were instructed to
          start collecting data. Information includes the agent/connector  ID,
          a description of the operation performed, and whether the agent/con-
          nector configuration was updated.

          (structure)
              Information about agents or connectors that were  instructed  to
              start  collecting data. Information includes the agent/connector
              ID, a description of the operation, and whether  the  agent/con-
              nector configuration was updated.

              agentId -> (string)
                 The agent/connector ID.

              operationSucceeded -> (boolean)
                 Information  about  the status of the StartDataCollection and
                 StopDataCollection operations. The system  has  recorded  the
                 data  collection operation. The agent/connector receives this
                 command the next time it polls for a new command.

              description -> (string)
                 A description of the operation performed.
