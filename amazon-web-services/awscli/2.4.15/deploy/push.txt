PUSH()                                                                  PUSH()



NAME
       push -

DESCRIPTION
       Bundles  and  uploads  to  Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) an
       application revision, which is a zip archive file that contains deploy-
       able  content  and an accompanying Application Specification file (App-
       Spec file). If the upload is successful, a  message  is  returned  that
       describes  how  to  call  the  create-deployment  command to deploy the
       application revision from Amazon S3 to target  Amazon  Elastic  Compute
       Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            push
          --application-name <app-name>
          --s3-location s3://<bucket>/<key>
          [--ignore-hidden-files | --no-ignore-hidden-files]
          [--source <path>]
          [--description <description>]

OPTIONS
       --application-name  (string)  Required.  The name of the AWS CodeDeploy
       application to be associated with the application revision.

       --s3-location (string) Required. Information about the location of  the
       application revision to be uploaded to Amazon S3. You must specify both
       a bucket and a key that represent the Amazon S3  bucket  name  and  the
       object  key name. Content will be zipped before uploading. Use the for-
       mat s3:///

       --ignore-hidden-files |  --no-ignore-hidden-files  (boolean)  Optional.
       Set  the  --ignore-hidden-files  flag  to  not bundle and upload hidden
       files to Amazon S3; otherwise, set  the  --no-ignore-hidden-files  flag
       (the default) to bundle and upload hidden files to Amazon S3.

       --source  (string) Optional. The location of the deployable content and
       the accompanying AppSpec file on the development machine to  be  zipped
       and  uploaded  to Amazon S3. If not specified, the current directory is
       used.

       --description (string) Optional. A comment that summarizes the applica-
       tion  revision.  If  not specified, the default string "Uploaded by AWS
       CLI 'time' UTC" is used, where 'time' is the  current  system  time  in
       Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To  bundle and deploy an AWS CodeDeploy compatible application revision
       to Amazon S3

       The following push example bundles and deploys an application  revision
       to  Amazon  S3  and  then  associates the application revision with the
       specified application.

          aws deploy push \
              --application-name WordPress_App \
              --description "This is my deployment" \
              --ignore-hidden-files \
              --s3-location s3://CodeDeployDemoBucket/WordPressApp.zip \
              --source /tmp/MyLocalDeploymentFolder/

       The output describes how to use the create-deployment command to create
       a deployment that uses the uploaded application revision.

          To deploy with this revision, run:
          aws deploy create-deployment --application-name WordPress_App --deployment-config-name <deployment-config-name> --deployment-group-name <deployment-group-name> --s3-location bucket=CodeDeployDemoBucket,key=WordPressApp.zip,bundleType=zip,eTag="cecc9b8EXAMPLE50a6e71fdb88EXAMPLE",version=LFsJAUdEXAMPLEfvKtvi79L8EXAMPLE
