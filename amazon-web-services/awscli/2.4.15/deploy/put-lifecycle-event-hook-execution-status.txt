PUT-LIFECYCLE-EVENT-HOOK-EXECUTION-PUT-LIFECYCLE-EVENT-HOOK-EXECUTION-STATUS()



NAME
       put-lifecycle-event-hook-execution-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets the result of a Lambda validation function. The function validates
       lifecycle hooks during a deployment that uses the AWS Lambda or  Amazon
       ECS compute platform. For AWS Lambda deployments, the available lifecy-
       cle hooks are BeforeAllowTraffic and AfterAllowTraffic . For Amazon ECS
       deployments, the available lifecycle hooks are BeforeInstall , AfterIn-
       stall , AfterAllowTestTraffic , BeforeAllowTraffic  ,  and  AfterAllow-
       Traffic  . Lambda validation functions return Succeeded or Failed . For
       more information, see AppSpec 'hooks' Section for an AWS Lambda Deploy-
       ment and AppSpec 'hooks' Section for an Amazon ECS Deployment .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-lifecycle-event-hook-execution-status
          [--deployment-id <value>]
          [--lifecycle-event-hook-execution-id <value>]
          [--status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --deployment-id (string)
          The  unique  ID  of  a deployment. Pass this ID to a Lambda function
          that validates a deployment lifecycle event.

       --lifecycle-event-hook-execution-id (string)
          The execution ID of a  deployment's  lifecycle  hook.  A  deployment
          lifecycle  hook  is  specified  in  the hooks section of the AppSpec
          file.

       --status (string)
          The result of a Lambda function that validates a deployment  lifecy-
          cle event. Succeeded and Failed are the only valid values for status
          .

          Possible values:

          o Pending

          o InProgress

          o Succeeded

          o Failed

          o Skipped

          o Unknown

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       lifecycleEventHookExecutionId -> (string)
          The execution ID of the lifecycle event hook. A hook is specified in
          the hooks section of the deployment's AppSpec file.
