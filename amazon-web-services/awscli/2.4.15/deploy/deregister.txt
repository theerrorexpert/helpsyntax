EXAMPLES
       To deregister an on-premises instance

       The  following  deregister  example deregisters an on-premises instance
       with AWS CodeDeploy. It does not delete the IAM user that is associated
       with  the  instance. It disassociates in AWS CodeDeploy the on-premises
       tags from the instance. It does not uninstall the AWS CodeDeploy  Agent
       from  the  instance  nor remove the on-premises configuration file from
       the instance.

          aws deploy deregister \
              --instance-name AssetTag12010298EX \
              --no-delete-iam-user \
              --region us-west-2
