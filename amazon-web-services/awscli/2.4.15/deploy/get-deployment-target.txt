GET-DEPLOYMENT-TARGET()                                GET-DEPLOYMENT-TARGET()



NAME
       get-deployment-target -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about a deployment target.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-deployment-target
          [--deployment-id <value>]
          [--target-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --deployment-id (string)
          The unique ID of a deployment.

       --target-id (string)
          The unique ID of a deployment target.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To return information about a deployment target

       The following get-deployment-target example returns information about a
       deployment target that is associated with the specified deployment.

          aws deploy get-deployment-target \
              --deployment-id "d-A1B2C3111" \
              --target-id "i-a1b2c3d4e5f611111"

          such as its status, lifecycle events, and when it was last  updated.
          It  also  contains metadata about the deployment target. The deploy-
          ment  target  metadata  depends  on  the  deployment  target's  type
          (instanceTarget , lambdaTarget , or ecsTarget ).

          deploymentTargetType -> (string)
              The deployment type that is specific to the deployment's compute
              platform or deployments  initiated  by  a  CloudFormation  stack
              update.

          instanceTarget -> (structure)
              Information  about  the  target  for  a deployment that uses the

                 instanceTarget .

                 (structure)
                     Information about a set of Amazon ECS  tasks  in  an  AWS
                     CodeDeploy  deployment.  An  Amazon ECS task set includes
                     details such as the desired number  of  tasks,  how  many
                     tasks  are  running, and whether the task set serves pro-
                     duction traffic. An AWS CodeDeploy application that  uses
                     the  Amazon  ECS compute platform deploys a containerized
                     application in an Amazon ECS service as a task set.

                     identifer -> (string)
                        A unique ID of an ECSTaskSet .

                     desiredCount -> (long)
                        The number of tasks in a task set. During a deployment
                        that  uses  the  Amazon  ECS  compute type, CodeDeploy
                        instructs Amazon ECS to create a new task set and uses
                        this  value  to  determine  how  many tasks to create.
                        After the updated  task  set  is  created,  CodeDeploy
                        shifts traffic to the new task set.

                     pendingCount -> (long)
                        The  number  of  tasks in the task set that are in the
                        PENDING status during an Amazon ECS deployment. A task
                        in the PENDING state is preparing to enter the RUNNING
                        state. A task set enters the PENDING  status  when  it
                        launches  for  the first time, or when it is restarted
                        after being in the STOPPED state.

                     runningCount -> (long)
                        The number of tasks in the task set that  are  in  the
                        RUNNING status during an Amazon ECS deployment. A task
                        in the RUNNING state is running and ready for use.

                     status -> (string)
                        The status of the task set. There are three valid task
                        set statuses:

                        o PRIMARY  : Indicates the task set is serving produc-
                          tion traffic.

                        o ACTIVE : Indicates the task set is not serving  pro-
                          duction traffic.

                        o DRAINING  :  Indicates the tasks in the task set are
                          being stopped and their  corresponding  targets  are
                          being deregistered from their target group.

                     trafficWeight -> (double)
                        The percentage of traffic served by this task set.

                     targetGroup -> (structure)
                        The  target  group  associated  with the task set. The
                        target group is used by AWS CodeDeploy to manage traf-
                        fic to a task set.

                        name -> (string)
                            For blue/green deployments, the name of the target
                            group that instances in the  original  environment
                            are   deregistered  from,  and  instances  in  the
                            replacement environment are registered  with.  For
                            in-place deployments, the name of the target group
                            that instances are deregistered from, so they  are
                            not  serving traffic during a deployment, and then
                            re-registered with after the  deployment  is  com-
                            plete.

                     taskSetLabel -> (string)
                        A label that identifies whether the ECS task set is an
                        original target (BLUE ) or a replacement target (GREEN
                        ).

          cloudFormationTarget -> (structure)
              Information about the target to be updated by an AWS CloudForma-
              tion blue/green deployment. This target type  is  used  for  all
              deployments initiated by a CloudFormation stack update.

              deploymentId -> (string)
                 The unique ID of an AWS CloudFormation blue/green deployment.

              targetId -> (string)
                 The unique ID of a deployment  target  that  has  a  type  of
                 CloudFormationTarget .

              lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  date and time when the target application was updated by
                 an AWS CloudFormation blue/green deployment.

              lifecycleEvents -> (list)
