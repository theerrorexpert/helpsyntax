LIST-DEPLOYMENTS()                                          LIST-DEPLOYMENTS()



NAME
       list-deployments -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  deployments in a deployment group for an application regis-
       tered with the IAM user or AWS account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-deployments is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: deployments

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          The  name  of  an AWS CodeDeploy application associated with the IAM
          user or AWS account.

          NOTE:
              If applicationName is specified, then  deploymentGroupName  must
              be  specified.  If it is not specified, then deploymentGroupName
              must not be specified.

       --deployment-group-name (string)
          The name of a deployment group for the specified application.

          NOTE:
              If deploymentGroupName is specified, then  applicationName  must
              be  specified. If it is not specified, then applicationName must
              not be specified.

       --external-id (string)
          The unique ID of an  external  resource  for  returning  deployments
          linked to the external resource.

       --include-only-statuses (list)
          A subset of deployments to list by status:

          o Created : Include created deployments in the resulting list.

          o Queued : Include queued deployments in the resulting list.

          o In  Progress  :  Include  in-progress deployments in the resulting
            list.

          o Succeeded : Include successful deployments in the resulting  list.

          o Failed : Include failed deployments in the resulting list.

          o Stopped : Include stopped deployments in the resulting list.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            Created
            Queued
            InProgress
            Baking
            Succeeded
            Failed
            Stopped
            Ready

       --create-time-range (structure)
          A  time  range (start and end) for returning a subset of the list of
          deployments.

          start -> (timestamp)
              The start time of the time range.

              NOTE:
                 Specify null to leave the start time open-ended.

          end -> (timestamp)
              The end time of the time range.

              NOTE:
                 Specify null to leave the end time open-ended.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          start=timestamp,end=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "start": timestamp,
            "end": timestamp
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about deployments

       The follwoing list-deployments example displays information  about  all
       deployments  that  are  associated  with  the specified application and
       deployment group.

          aws deploy list-deployments \
              --application-name WordPress_App \
              --create-time-range start=2014-08-19T00:00:00,end=2014-08-20T00:00:00 \
              --deployment-group-name WordPress_DG \
              --include-only-statuses Failed

       Output:

          {
              "deployments": [
                  "d-EXAMPLE11",
                  "d-EXAMPLE22",
                  "d-EXAMPLE33"
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       deployments -> (list)
          A list of deployment IDs.

          (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          If a large amount of information is returned, an identifier is  also
          returned.  It  can  be used in a subsequent list deployments call to
          return the next set of deployments in the list.
