LIST-DEPLOYMENT-GROUPS()                              LIST-DEPLOYMENT-GROUPS()



NAME
       list-deployment-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the deployment groups for an application registered with the IAM
       user or AWS account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-deployment-groups is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: deploymentGroups

SYNOPSIS
            list-deployment-groups
          --application-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          The  name  of  an AWS CodeDeploy application associated with the IAM
          user or AWS account.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about deployment groups

       The following list-deployment-groups example displays information about
       all  deployment  groups that are associated with the specified applica-
       tion.

          aws deploy list-deployment-groups --application-name WordPress_App

       Output:

          {
              "applicationName": "WordPress_App",
              "deploymentGroups": [
                  "WordPress_DG",
                  "WordPress_Beta_DG"
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       applicationName -> (string)
          The application name.

       deploymentGroups -> (list)
          A list of deployment group names.

          (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          If a large amount of information is returned, an identifier is  also
          returned. It can be used in a subsequent list deployment groups call
          to return the next set of deployment groups in the list.
