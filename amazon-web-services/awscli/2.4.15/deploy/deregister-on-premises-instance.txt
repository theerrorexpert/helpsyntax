NAME
       deregister-on-premises-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Deregisters an on-premises instance.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            deregister-on-premises-instance
          --instance-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-name (string)
          The name of the on-premises instance to deregister.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To deregister an on-premises instance

       The  following  deregister-on-premises-instance  example deregisters an
       on-premises instance with AWS CodeDeploy, but it does  not  delete  the
       IAM  user associated with the instance, nor does it disassociate in AWS
       CodeDeploy the on-premises instance tags from  the  instance.  It  also
       does  not  uninstall  the  AWS  CodeDeploy  Agent from the instance nor
       remove the on-premises configuration file from the instance.

          aws deploy deregister-on-premises-instance --instance-name AssetTag12010298EX

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       None
