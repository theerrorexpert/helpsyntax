NAME
       batch-get-deployment-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This  method works, but is deprecated. Use BatchGetDeploymentTargets
          instead.

       Returns an array of one or more instances associated with a deployment.
       This  method  works  with  EC2/On-premises and AWS Lambda compute plat-
       forms. The newer BatchGetDeploymentTargets works with all compute plat-
       forms. The maximum number of instances that can be returned is 25.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-get-deployment-instances
          --deployment-id <value>
          --instance-ids <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --deployment-id (string)
          The unique ID of a deployment.

       --instance-ids (list)
          The unique IDs of instances used in the deployment. The maximum num-
          ber of instance IDs you can specify is 25.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
