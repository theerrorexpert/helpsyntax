LIST-DEPLOYMENT-TARGETS()                            LIST-DEPLOYMENT-TARGETS()



NAME
       list-deployment-targets -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns an array of target IDs that are associated a deployment.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-deployment-targets  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: targetIds

SYNOPSIS
            list-deployment-targets
          [--deployment-id <value>]
          [--target-filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --deployment-id (string)
          The unique ID of a deployment.

       --target-filters (map)
          A key used to filter the returned targets. The two valid values are:

          o TargetStatus  -  A  TargetStatus  filter  string  can  be Failed ,
            InProgress , Pending , Ready , Skipped , Succeeded , or Unknown  .

          o ServerInstanceLabel  -  A ServerInstanceLabel filter string can be
            Blue or Green .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

            KeyName1=string,string,KeyName2=string,string

          Where valid key names are:
            TargetStatus
            ServerInstanceLabel

       JSON Syntax:

          {"TargetStatus"|"ServerInstanceLabel": ["string", ...]
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve a list of target IDs that are associated with a deployment

       The following list-deployment-targets example retrieves a list of  tar-
       get  IDs  associated with deployments that have a status of "Failed" or
       "InProgress."

          aws deploy list-deployment-targets \
              --deployment-id "d-A1B2C3111" \
              --target-filters "{\"TargetStatus\":[\"Failed\",\"InProgress\"]}"

       Output:

          {
              "targetIds": [
                  "i-0f1558aaf90e5f1f9"
              ]
          }

       For more information, see ListDeploymentTargets in the  AWS  CodeDeploy
       API Reference.

OUTPUT
       targetIds -> (list)
          The unique IDs of deployment targets.

          (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          If  a large amount of information is returned, a token identifier is
          also returned. It can be used in a subsequent  ListDeploymentTargets
          call to return the next set of deployment targets in the list.
