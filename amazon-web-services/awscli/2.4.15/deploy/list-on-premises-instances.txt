LIST-ON-PREMISES-INSTANCES()                      LIST-ON-PREMISES-INSTANCES()



NAME
       list-on-premises-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of names for one or more on-premises instances.

       Unless   otherwise   specified,   both   registered   and  deregistered
       on-premises instance names are  listed.  To  list  only  registered  or
       deregistered  on-premises  instance  names, use the registration status
       parameter.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-on-premises-instances is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: instanceNames

SYNOPSIS
            list-on-premises-instances
          [--registration-status <value>]
          [--tag-filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --registration-status (string)
          The registration status of the on-premises instances:

          o Deregistered  :  Include deregistered on-premises instances in the
            resulting list.

          o Registered :  Include  registered  on-premises  instances  in  the
            resulting list.

          Possible values:

          o Registered

          o Deregistered

       --tag-filters (list)
          The  on-premises  instance  tags  that  are  used  to  restrict  the
          on-premises instance names returned.

          (structure)
              Information about an on-premises instance tag filter.

              Key -> (string)
                 The on-premises instance tag filter key.

              Value -> (string)
                 The on-premises instance tag filter value.

              Type -> (string)
                 The on-premises instance tag filter type:

                 o KEY_ONLY: Key only.

                 o VALUE_ONLY: Value only.

                 o KEY_AND_VALUE: Key and value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string,Type=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string",
              "Type": "KEY_ONLY"|"VALUE_ONLY"|"KEY_AND_VALUE"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about one or more on-premises instances

       The following list-on-premises-instances example retrieves  a  list  of
       available  on-premises instance names for instances that are registered
       in AWS CodeDeploy and also have the specified on-premises instance  tag
       associated in AWS CodeDeploy with the instance.

          aws deploy list-on-premises-instances \
              --registration-status Registered \
              --tag-filters Key=Name,Value=CodeDeployDemo-OnPrem,Type=KEY_AND_VALUE

       Output:

          {
              "instanceNames": [
                  "AssetTag12010298EX"
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       instanceNames -> (list)
          The list of matching on-premises instance names.

          (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          If  a large amount of information is returned, an identifier is also
          returned. It can be used in a subsequent list on-premises  instances
          call to return the next set of on-premises instances in the list.
