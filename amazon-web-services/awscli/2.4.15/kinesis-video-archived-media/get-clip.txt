GET-CLIP()                                                          GET-CLIP()



NAME
       get-clip -

DESCRIPTION
       Downloads  an  MP4 file (clip) containing the archived, on-demand media
       from the specified video stream over the specified time range.

       Both the StreamName and the StreamARN parameters are optional, but  you
       must  specify either the StreamName or the StreamARN when invoking this
       API operation.

       As a prerequisite to using GetCLip API, you  must  obtain  an  endpoint
       using GetDataEndpoint , specifying GET_CLIP forthe APIName parameter.

       An  Amazon Kinesis video stream has the following requirements for pro-
       viding data through MP4:

       o The media must contain h.264 or h.265 encoded video and,  optionally,
         AAC  or  G.711  encoded  audio. Specifically, the codec ID of track 1
         should be V_MPEG/ISO/AVC (for h.264) or V_MPEGH/ISO/HEVC (for H.265).
         Optionally,  the  codec  ID  of  track 2 should be A_AAC (for AAC) or
         A_MS/ACM (for G.711).

       o Data retention must be greater than 0.

       o The video track of each fragment must contain codec private  data  in
         the  Advanced  Video Coding (AVC) for H.264 format and HEVC for H.265
         format.  For  more  information,  see  MPEG-4  specification  ISO/IEC
         14496-15 . For information about adapting stream data to a given for-
         mat, see NAL Adaptation Flags .

       o The audio track (if present) of each fragment must contain codec pri-
         vate  data  in the AAC format (AAC specification ISO/IEC 13818-7 ) or
         the MS Wave format .

       You can monitor the amount of outgoing  data  by  monitoring  the  Get-
       Clip.OutgoingBytes  Amazon  CloudWatch  metric.  For  information about
       using CloudWatch to monitor Kinesis Video Streams, see Monitoring Kine-
       sis  Video  Streams . For pricing information, see Amazon Kinesis Video
       Streams Pricing and AWS Pricing . Charges for outgoing AWS data  apply.

SYNOPSIS
            get-clip
          [--stream-name <value>]
          [--stream-arn <value>]
          --clip-fragment-selector <value>
          <outfile>

OPTIONS
       --stream-name (string)
          The name of the stream for which to retrieve the media clip.

          You must specify either the StreamName or the StreamARN.

       --stream-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the stream for which to retrieve
          the media clip.

          You must specify either the StreamName or the StreamARN.

       --clip-fragment-selector (structure)
          The time range of the requested clip and the  source  of  the  time-
          stamps.

          FragmentSelectorType -> (string)
              The origin of the timestamps to use (Server or Producer).

          TimestampRange -> (structure)
              The range of timestamps to return.

              StartTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The  starting  timestamp in the range of timestamps for which
                 to return fragments.

                 Only fragments that start exactly at or after  StartTimestamp
                 are  included  in  the  session.  Fragments that start before
                 StartTimestamp and continue past it aren't  included  in  the
                 session.  If  FragmentSelectorType  is SERVER_TIMESTAMP , the
                 StartTimestamp must be later than the stream head.

              EndTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The end of the timestamp range for the requested media.

                 This value must be within 24 hours of  the  specified  Start-
                 Timestamp  ,  and  it  must  be later than the StartTimestamp
                 value.   If   FragmentSelectorType   for   the   request   is
                 SERVER_TIMESTAMP , this value must be in the past.

                 This  value is inclusive. The EndTimestamp is compared to the
                 (starting) timestamp of the fragment.  Fragments  that  start
                 before  the  EndTimestamp  value  and  continue  past  it are
                 included in the session.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FragmentSelectorType=string,TimestampRange={StartTimestamp=timestamp,EndTimestamp=timestamp}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "FragmentSelectorType": "PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP"|"SERVER_TIMESTAMP",
            "TimestampRange": {
              "StartTimestamp": timestamp,
              "EndTimestamp": timestamp
            }
          }

       outfile (string) Filename where the content will be saved

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ContentType -> (string)
          The content type of the media in the requested clip.

       Payload -> (blob)
          Traditional MP4 file that contains the media clip from the specified
          video  stream. The output will contain the first 100 MB or the first
          200 fragments from the specified start timestamp. For more  informa-
          tion, see Kinesis Video Streams Limits .
