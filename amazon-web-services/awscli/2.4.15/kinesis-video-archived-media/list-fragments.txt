LIST-FRAGMENTS()                                              LIST-FRAGMENTS()



NAME
       list-fragments -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of  Fragment objects from the specified stream and time-
       stamp range within the archived data.

       Listing fragments is eventually consistent. This means that even if the
       producer  receives  an acknowledgment that a fragment is persisted, the
       result might not be returned immediately from a  request  to  ListFrag-
       ments  . However, results are typically available in less than one sec-
       ond.

       NOTE:
          You must first call the GetDataEndpoint API to get an endpoint. Then
          send   the   ListFragments  requests  to  this  endpoint  using  the
          --endpoint-url parameter .

       WARNING:
          If an error  is  thrown  after  invoking  a  Kinesis  Video  Streams
          archived  media  API,  in  addition  to the HTTP status code and the
          response body, it includes the following pieces of information:

          o x-amz-ErrorType HTTP header  contains a more specific  error  type
            in addition to what the HTTP status code provides.

          o x-amz-RequestId  HTTP  header   if  you want to report an issue to
            AWS, the support team can better diagnose the problem if given the
            Request Id.

          Both  the  HTTP status code and the ErrorType header can be utilized
          to make programmatic decisions about whether errors  are  retry-able
          and  under  what  conditions, as well as provide information on what
          actions the client programmer might need to take in  order  to  suc-
          cessfully try again.

          For  more  information, see the Errors section at the bottom of this
          topic, as well as Common Errors .

       list-fragments is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Fragments

SYNOPSIS
            list-fragments
          [--stream-name <value>]
          [--stream-arn <value>]
          [--fragment-selector <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stream-name (string)
          The name of the stream from which to retrieve a fragment list. Spec-
          ify either this parameter or the StreamARN parameter.

       --stream-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the stream from which to  retrieve
          a  fragment  list.  Specify  either this parameter or the StreamName
          parameter.

       --fragment-selector (structure)
          Describes the timestamp range and timestamp origin for the range  of
          fragments to return.

          FragmentSelectorType -> (string)
              The origin of the timestamps to use (Server or Producer).

          TimestampRange -> (structure)
              The range of timestamps to return.

              StartTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The  starting  timestamp in the range of timestamps for which
                 to return fragments.

              EndTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The ending timestamp in the range of timestamps for which  to
                 return fragments.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FragmentSelectorType=string,TimestampRange={StartTimestamp=timestamp,EndTimestamp=timestamp}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "FragmentSelectorType": "PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP"|"SERVER_TIMESTAMP",
            "TimestampRange": {
              "StartTimestamp": timestamp,
              "EndTimestamp": timestamp
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (long)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (long)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Fragments -> (list)
          A list of archived  Fragment objects from the stream that  meet  the
          selector  criteria.  Results  are  in no specific order, even across
          pages.

          (structure)
              Represents a segment of video or other time-delimited data.

              FragmentNumber -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the fragment. This  value  monotoni-
                 cally increases based on the ingestion order.

              FragmentSizeInBytes -> (long)
                 The  total  fragment  size,  including  information about the
                 fragment and contained media data.

              ProducerTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp from the producer corresponding  to  the  frag-
                 ment.

              ServerTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The  timestamp from the AWS server corresponding to the frag-
                 ment.

              FragmentLengthInMilliseconds -> (long)
                 The playback duration or other time value associated with the
                 fragment.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the returned list is truncated, the operation returns this token
          to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is null when
          there are no more results to return.
