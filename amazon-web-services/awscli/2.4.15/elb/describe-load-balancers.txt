DESCRIBE-LOAD-BALANCERS()                            DESCRIBE-LOAD-BALANCERS()



NAME
       describe-load-balancers -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  specified  the load balancers. If no load balancers are
       specified, the call describes all of your load balancers.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-load-balancers is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: LoadBalancerDescriptions

SYNOPSIS
            describe-load-balancers
          [--load-balancer-names <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --load-balancer-names (list)
          The names of the load balancers.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

                        Protocol -> (string)
                            The  load  balancer  transport protocol to use for
                            routing: HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, or SSL.

                        LoadBalancerPort -> (integer)
                            The port on which the load balancer is  listening.
                            On  EC2-VPC,  you  can  specify  any port from the
                            range 1-65535. On EC2-Classic, you can specify any
                            port  from  the  following list: 25, 80, 443, 465,
                            587, 1024-65535.

                            front-end  protocol is HTTP or HTTPS, the back-end
                            protocol must be HTTP or HTTPS.

                            If there is another listener with the same Instan-
                            cePort whose InstanceProtocol is secure, (HTTPS or
                            SSL), the listener's InstanceProtocol must also be
                            secure.

                            If there is another listener with the same Instan-
                            cePort whose InstanceProtocol is HTTP or TCP,  the
                            listener's InstanceProtocol must be HTTP or TCP.

                            tificate.

                     PolicyNames -> (list)
                        The policies. If there are no  policies  enabled,  the
                        list is empty.

                            The time  period,  in  seconds,  after  which  the
                            cookie should be considered stale. If this parame-
                            ter is not specified, the stickiness session lasts
                            for the duration of the browser session.

                 OtherPolicies -> (list)

                 The IDs of the instances for the load balancer.

                 (structure)
                     The ID of an EC2 instance.

                     InstanceId -> (string)
                        The instance ID.

              HealthCheck -> (structure)
                 Information about the health checks  conducted  on  the  load
                 balancer.

                 Target -> (string)
                     The  instance  being checked. The protocol is either TCP,
                     HTTP, HTTPS, or SSL. The range of valid ports is one  (1)
                     through 65535.

                     TCP  is  the  default, specified as a TCP: port pair, for
                     example "TCP:5000". In this case, a health  check  simply
                     attempts  to open a TCP connection to the instance on the
                     specified port. Failure to connect within the  configured
                     timeout is considered unhealthy.

                     SSL  is  also  specified  as SSL: port pair, for example,
                     SSL:5000.

                     For HTTP/HTTPS, you must  include  a  ping  path  in  the
                     string.  HTTP  is  specified as a HTTP:port;/;PathToPing;
                     grouping, for example "HTTP:80/weather/us/wa/seattle". In
                     this  case,  a HTTP GET request is issued to the instance
                     on the given port and path. Any answer  other  than  "200
                     OK" within the timeout period is considered unhealthy.

                     The  total  length  of  the HTTP ping target must be 1024

                     The  amount of time, in seconds, during which no response
                     means a failed health check.

                     This value must be less than the Interval value.

                 UnhealthyThreshold -> (integer)
                     The number of consecutive health check failures  required
                     before moving the instance to the Unhealthy state.

                 HealthyThreshold -> (integer)
                     The   number   of  consecutive  health  checks  successes

              SourceSecurityGroup -> (structure)
                 The  security  group for the load balancer, which you can use
                 as part of your inbound rules for your registered  instances.
                 To  only  allow  traffic  from load balancers, add a security
                 group rule that specifies this source security group  as  the
                 inbound source.

                 OwnerAlias -> (string)
                     The owner of the security group.

                 GroupName -> (string)
                     The name of the security group.

              SecurityGroups -> (list)
                 The  security  groups  for  the load balancer. Valid only for
                 load balancers in a VPC.

                 (string)

              CreatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the load balancer was created.

              Scheme -> (string)
                 The type of load balancer. Valid only for load balancers in a
                 VPC.

                 If Scheme is internet-facing , the load balancer has a public
                 DNS name that resolves to a public IP address.

                 If Scheme is internal , the load balancer has  a  public  DNS
                 name that resolves to a private IP address.

       NextMarker -> (string)
          The  marker to use when requesting the next set of results. If there
          are no additional results, the string is empty.
