       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            configure-health-check
          --load-balancer-name <value>
          --health-check <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --load-balancer-name (string)
          The name of the load balancer.

       --health-check (structure)
          The configuration information.

          Target -> (string)
              The  instance  being  checked. The protocol is either TCP, HTTP,
              HTTPS, or SSL. The range of  valid  ports  is  one  (1)  through
              65535.

              TCP  is  the default, specified as a TCP: port pair, for example
              "TCP:5000". In this case, a health check simply attempts to open
              a  TCP connection to the instance on the specified port. Failure
              to  connect  within  the  configured   timeout   is   considered
              unhealthy.

              SSL  is also specified as SSL: port pair, for example, SSL:5000.

              For HTTP/HTTPS, you must include a ping path in the string. HTTP
              is  specified as a HTTP:port;/;PathToPing; grouping, for example
              "HTTP:80/weather/us/wa/seattle".  In  this  case,  a  HTTP   GET
              request  is  issued  to the instance on the given port and path.
              Any answer other than "200 OK" within the timeout period is con-
              sidered unhealthy.

              The  total  length  of  the HTTP ping target must be 1024 16-bit
              Unicode characters or less.

          Interval -> (integer)
              The approximate interval, in seconds, between health  checks  of
              an individual instance.

          Timeout -> (integer)
              The amount of time, in seconds, during which no response means a
              failed health check.

              This value must be less than the Interval value.

          UnhealthyThreshold -> (integer)
              The number of consecutive health check failures required  before
              moving the instance to the Unhealthy state.

          HealthyThreshold -> (integer)
              The  number  of  consecutive  health  checks  successes required
              before moving the instance to the Healthy state.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Target=string,Interval=integer,Timeout=integer,UnhealthyThreshold=integer,HealthyThreshold=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Target": "string",
            "Interval": integer,
            "Timeout": integer,
            "UnhealthyThreshold": integer,
            "HealthyThreshold": integer
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To specify the health check settings for your backend EC2 instances

       This example specifies the health check settings used to  evaluate  the
       health of your backend EC2 instances.

       Command:

          aws elb configure-health-check --load-balancer-name my-load-balancer --health-check Target=HTTP:80/png,Interval=30,UnhealthyThreshold=2,HealthyThreshold=2,Timeout=3

       Output:

          {
             "HealthCheck": {
                 "HealthyThreshold": 2,
                 "Interval": 30,
                 "Target": "HTTP:80/png",
                 "Timeout": 3,
                 "UnhealthyThreshold": 2
             }
          }

       HealthCheck -> (structure)

          Target -> (string)

              an individual instance.

          Timeout -> (integer)

              failed health check.

              This value must be less than the Interval value.

          UnhealthyThreshold -> (integer)
              The number of consecutive health check failures required  before
