DELETE-LOAD-BALANCER()                                  DELETE-LOAD-BALANCER()



NAME
       delete-load-balancer -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the specified load balancer.

       If you are attempting to recreate a load balancer, you must reconfigure
       all settings. The DNS name associated with a deleted load balancer  are
       no  longer  usable.  The  name and associated DNS record of the deleted
       load balancer no longer exist  and  traffic  sent  to  any  of  its  IP
       addresses is no longer delivered to your instances.

       If  the  load  balancer does not exist or has already been deleted, the
       call to DeleteLoadBalancer still succeeds.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-load-balancer
          --load-balancer-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --load-balancer-name (string)
          The name of the load balancer.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
