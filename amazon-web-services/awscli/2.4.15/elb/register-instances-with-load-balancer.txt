NAME
       register-instances-with-load-balancer -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds the specified instances to the specified load balancer.

       The instance must be a running instance in the same network as the load
       balancer (EC2-Classic  or  the  same  VPC).  If  you  have  EC2-Classic
       instances  and  a  load balancer in a VPC with ClassicLink enabled, you
       can link the EC2-Classic instances to that VPC and  then  register  the
       linked EC2-Classic instances with the load balancer in the VPC.

       Note  that  RegisterInstanceWithLoadBalancer completes when the request
       has been registered. Instance registration takes a little time to  com-
       plete.   To   check   the   state  of  the  registered  instances,  use
       DescribeLoadBalancers or  DescribeInstanceHealth .

       After the instance is  registered,  it  starts  receiving  traffic  and
       requests from the load balancer. Any instance that is not in one of the
       Availability Zones registered for the load balancer  is  moved  to  the
       OutOfService  state.  If an Availability Zone is added to the load bal-
       ancer later, any instances registered with the load  balancer  move  to
       the InService state.

       To deregister instances from a load balancer, use  DeregisterInstances-
       FromLoadBalancer .

       For more information, see Register or De-Register EC2 Instances in  the
       Classic Load Balancers Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            register-instances-with-load-balancer
          --load-balancer-name <value>
          --instances <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --load-balancer-name (string)
          The name of the load balancer.

       --instances (list)
          The IDs of the instances.

          (structure)
              The ID of an EC2 instance.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The instance ID.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          --instances InstanceId1 InstanceId2 InstanceId3

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "InstanceId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To register instances with a load balancer

       This  example  registers the specified instance with the specified load
       balancer.

       Command:

          aws elb register-instances-with-load-balancer --load-balancer-name my-load-balancer --instances i-d6f6fae3

       Output:

          {
             "Instances": [
                 {
                     "InstanceId": "i-d6f6fae3"
                 },
                 {
                     "InstanceId": "i-207d9717"
                 },
                 {
                     "InstanceId": "i-afefb49b"
                 }
             ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Instances -> (list)
          The updated list of instances for the load balancer.

          (structure)
              The ID of an EC2 instance.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The instance ID.
