NAME
       configservice -

DESCRIPTION
       Config  provides  a  way to keep track of the configurations of all the
       Amazon Web Services resources associated with your Amazon Web  Services
       account.  You can use Config to get the current and historical configu-
       rations of each Amazon Web Services resource and also to  get  informa-
       tion  about  the relationship between the resources. An Amazon Web Ser-
       vices resource can be an Amazon Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, an
       Elastic  Block  Store (EBS) volume, an elastic network Interface (ENI),
       or a security group. For a complete list of  resources  currently  sup-
       ported by Config, see Supported Amazon Web Services resources .

       You  can  access and manage Config through the Amazon Web Services Man-
       agement Console, the Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface (Amazon
       Web  Services CLI), the Config API, or the Amazon Web Services SDKs for
       Config. This reference guide contains documentation for the Config  API
       and  the  Amazon  Web  Services CLI commands that you can use to manage
       Config. The Config API uses the Signature Version 4 protocol for  sign-
       ing  requests.  For  more  information about how to sign a request with
       this protocol, see Signature Version 4 Signing Process .  For  detailed
       information  about Config features and their associated actions or com-
       mands, as well as how to work with Amazon Web Services Management  Con-
       sole, see What Is Config in the Config Developer Guide .
