            create-cluster
          [--backup-retention-policy <value>]
          --hsm-type <value>
          [--source-backup-id <value>]
          --subnet-ids <value>
          [--tag-list <value>]

OPTIONS
       --backup-retention-policy (structure)
          A policy that defines how the service retains backups.

          Type -> (string)
              The  type  of  backup  retention  policy. For the DAYS type, the
              value is the number of days to retain backups.

          Value -> (string)
              Use a value between 7 - 379.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string,Value=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Type": "DAYS",
            "Value": "string"
          }

       --hsm-type (string)
          The type of HSM to use in the cluster. Currently  the  only  allowed
          value is hsm1.medium .

       --source-backup-id (string)
          The identifier (ID) of the cluster backup to restore. Use this value
          to restore the cluster from a backup instead of creating a new clus-
          ter. To find the backup ID, use  DescribeBackups .

       --subnet-ids (list)
          The  identifiers  (IDs)  of  the  subnets where you are creating the
          cluster. You must specify at least one subnet. If you specify multi-
          ple subnets, they must meet the following criteria:

          o All subnets must be in the same virtual private cloud (VPC).

          o You can specify only one subnet per Availability Zone.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tag-list (list)
          Tags to apply to the CloudHSM cluster during creation.

          (structure)
              Contains a tag. A tag is a key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
