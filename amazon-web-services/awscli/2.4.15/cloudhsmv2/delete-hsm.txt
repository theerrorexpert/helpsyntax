DELETE-HSM()                                                      DELETE-HSM()



NAME
       delete-hsm -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the  specified HSM. To specify an HSM, you can use its identi-
       fier (ID), the IP address of the HSM's elastic network interface (ENI),
       or  the ID of the HSM's ENI. You need to specify only one of these val-
       ues. To find these values, use  DescribeClusters .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-hsm
          --cluster-id <value>
          [--hsm-id <value>]
          [--eni-id <value>]
          [--eni-ip <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-id (string)
          The identifier (ID) of the cluster that contains the  HSM  that  you
          are deleting.

       --hsm-id (string)
          The identifier (ID) of the HSM that you are deleting.

       --eni-id (string)
          The  identifier  (ID)  of the elastic network interface (ENI) of the
          HSM that you are deleting.

       --eni-ip (string)
          The IP address of the elastic network interface  (ENI)  of  the  HSM
          that you are deleting.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       HsmId -> (string)
          The identifier (ID) of the HSM that was deleted.
