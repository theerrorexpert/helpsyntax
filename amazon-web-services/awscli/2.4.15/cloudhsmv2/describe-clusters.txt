DESCRIBE-CLUSTERS()                                        DESCRIBE-CLUSTERS()



NAME
       describe-clusters -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about AWS CloudHSM clusters.

       This  is  a  paginated  operation, which means that each response might
       contain only a subset of all the clusters. When the  response  contains
       only  a  subset  of  clusters,  it includes a NextToken value. Use this
       value in a subsequent DescribeClusters request to  get  more  clusters.
       When  you  receive  a  response  with no NextToken (or an empty or null
       value), that means there are no more clusters to get.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-clusters is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Clusters

SYNOPSIS
            describe-clusters
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (map)
          One or more filters to limit the items returned in the response.

          Use  the  clusterIds  filter  to return only the specified clusters.
          Specify clusters by their cluster identifier (ID).

          Use the vpcIds filter to return only the clusters in  the  specified
          virtual  private clouds (VPCs). Specify VPCs by their VPC identifier
          (ID).

          Use the states filter to return only clusters that match the  speci-
          fied state.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,string,KeyName2=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": ["string", ...]
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
