IOT-DATA()                                                          IOT-DATA()



NAME
       iot-data -

DESCRIPTION
       IoT  data  enables  secure, bi-directional communication between Inter-
       net-connected things (such as sensors, actuators, embedded devices,  or
       smart  appliances)  and  the Amazon Web Services cloud. It implements a
       broker for applications and things to publish messages over HTTP  (Pub-
       lish)  and  retrieve, update, and delete shadows. A shadow is a persis-
       tent representation of your things and their state in  the  Amazon  Web
       Services cloud.

       Find  the  endpoint address for actions in IoT data by running this CLI
       command:
          aws iot describe-endpoint --endpoint-type iot:Data-ATS

       The service name used by Amazon Web ServicesSignature Version 4 to sign
       requests is: iotdevicegateway .

       NOTE:
          The default endpoint data.iot.[region].amazonaws.com is intended for
          testing purposes only. For production code  it  is  strongly  recom-
          mended to use the custom endpoint for your account  (retrievable via
          the iot describe-endpoint command) to ensure best  availability  and
          reachability of the service.
