CREATE-CANARY()                                                CREATE-CANARY()



NAME
       create-canary -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a canary. Canaries are scripts that monitor your endpoints and
       APIs from the outside-in. Canaries help you check the availability  and
       latency  of your web services and troubleshoot anomalies by investigat-
       ing load time data, screenshots of the UI, logs, and metrics.  You  can
       set up a canary to run continuously or just once.

       Do  not use CreateCanary to modify an existing canary. Use UpdateCanary
       instead.

       To create canaries, you must  have  the  CloudWatchSyntheticsFullAccess
       policy.  If  you  are  creating a new IAM role for the canary, you also
       need the the iam:CreateRole , iam:CreatePolicy and iam:AttachRolePolicy
       permissions.  For more information, see Necessary Roles and Permissions
       .

       Do not include secrets or proprietary information in your canary names.
       The canary name makes up part of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the
       canary, and the ARN is included in outbound calls  over  the  internet.
       For  more  information,  see  Security  Considerations  for  Synthetics
       Canaries .

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name for this canary. Be sure to give it a descriptive name that
          distinguishes it from other canaries in your account.

          Do  not  include  secrets  or proprietary information in your canary
          names. The canary name makes up part of the canary ARN, and the  ARN
          is  included  in outbound calls over the internet. For more informa-
          tion, see Security Considerations for Synthetics Canaries .

       --code (structure)
          A structure that includes the entry  point  from  which  the  canary
          should  start  running your script. If the script is stored in an S3
          bucket, the bucket name, key, and version are also included.

          S3Bucket -> (string)
              If your canary script is located in S3, specify the bucket  name
              here. Do not include s3:// as the start of the bucket name.

          S3Key -> (string)
              The  S3  key  of  your script. For more information, see Working
              with Amazon S3 Objects .

          S3Version -> (string)
              The S3 version ID of your script.

          ZipFile -> (blob)
              If you input your canary script directly into the canary instead
              of  referring  to an S3 location, the value of this parameter is
              the base64-encoded contents of the .zip file that  contains  the
              script. It must be smaller than 256 Kb.

          Handler -> (string)
              The  entry  point  to  use  for the source code when running the
              canary. This value must end  with  the  string  .handler  .  The
              string is limited to 29 characters or fewer.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Bucket=string,S3Key=string,S3Version=string,ZipFile=blob,Handler=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Bucket": "string",
            "S3Key": "string",
            "S3Version": "string",
            "ZipFile": blob,
            "Handler": "string"
          }

       --artifact-s3-location (string)
          The location in Amazon S3 where Synthetics stores artifacts from the
          test runs of this canary. Artifacts include the  log  file,  screen-
          shots,  and  HAR  files.  The  name of the S3 bucket can't include a
          period (.).

       --execution-role-arn (string)
          The ARN of the IAM role to be used to run the canary. This role must
          already  exist, and must include lambda.amazonaws.com as a principal
          in the trust policy. The role must also have the  following  permis-
          sions:

          o s3:PutObject

          o s3:GetBucketLocation

          o s3:ListAllMyBuckets

          o cloudwatch:PutMetricData

          o logs:CreateLogGroup

          o logs:CreateLogStream

          o logs:PutLogEvents

       --schedule (structure)
          A  structure that contains information about how often the canary is
          to run and when these test runs are to stop.

          Expression -> (string)
              A rate expression or a cron expression that  defines  how  often
              the canary is to run.

              For a rate expression, The syntax is rate(*number unit* ) . unit
              can be minute , minutes , or hour .

              For example, rate(1 minute)  runs  the  canary  once  a  minute,
              rate(10 minutes) runs it once every 10 minutes, and rate(1 hour)
              runs it once every hour. You can  specify  a  frequency  between
              rate(1 minute) and rate(1 hour) .

              Specifying  rate(0  minute)  or  rate(0 hour) is a special value
              that causes the canary to run only once when it is started.

              Use cron(*expression* ) to specify a cron expression. You  can't
              schedule  a  canary to wait for more than a year before running.
              For information about  the  syntax  for  cron  expressions,  see
              Scheduling canary runs using cron .

          DurationInSeconds -> (long)
              How  long, in seconds, for the canary to continue making regular
              runs according to the schedule in the Expression value.  If  you
              specify  0,  the canary continues making runs until you stop it.
              If you omit this field, the default of 0 is used.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Expression=string,DurationInSeconds=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Expression": "string",
            "DurationInSeconds": long
          }

       --run-config (structure)
          A structure that contains the configuration  for  individual  canary
          runs, such as timeout value.

          TimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
              How  long  the canary is allowed to run before it must stop. You
              can't set this time to be longer than the frequency of the  runs
              of this canary.

              If  you  omit this field, the frequency of the canary is used as
              this value, up to a maximum of 14 minutes.

          MemoryInMB -> (integer)
              The maximum amount of memory available to the canary while it is
              running, in MB. This value must be a multiple of 64.

          ActiveTracing -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  this  canary  is to use active X-Ray tracing
              when it runs. Active tracing enables this canary run to be  dis-
              played  in  the  ServiceLens  and X-Ray service maps even if the
              canary does not hit an endpoint that has X-Ray tracing  enabled.
              Using  X-Ray  tracing  incurs charges. For more information, see
              Canaries and X-Ray tracing .

              You can enable active tracing only for canaries that use version
              syn-nodejs-2.0 or later for their canary runtime.

          EnvironmentVariables -> (map)
              Specifies  the  keys and values to use for any environment vari-
              ables used in the canary script. Use the following format:

              { "key1" : "value1", "key2" : "value2", ...}

              Keys must start with a letter and be at  least  two  characters.
              The total size of your environment variables cannot exceed 4 KB.
              You can't specify any Lambda reserved environment  variables  as
              the  keys  for  your environment variables. For more information
              about reserved keys, see Runtime environment variables .

              key -> (string)

            "EnvironmentVariables": {"string": "string"
              ...}
          }

       --success-retention-period-in-days (integer)
          The number of days to retain data  about  successful  runs  of  this
          canary.  If you omit this field, the default of 31 days is used. The
          valid range is 1 to 455 days.

       --failure-retention-period-in-days (integer)
          The number of days to retain data about failed runs of this  canary.
          If  you  omit  this field, the default of 31 days is used. The valid
          range is 1 to 455 days.

       --runtime-version (string)
          Specifies the runtime version to use for the canary. For a  list  of
          valid  runtime versions and more information about runtime versions,
          see Canary Runtime Versions .

       --vpc-config (structure)
          If this canary is to test an endpoint in a VPC, this structure  con-
          tains  information  about  the subnet and security groups of the VPC
          endpoint. For more information, see Running a Canary in a VPC .

          SubnetIds -> (list)

          }

       --tags (map)
          A list of key-value pairs to associate with the canary. You can  as-
          sociate as many as 50 tags with a canary.

          Tags  can  help  you organize and categorize your resources. You can
          also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user  permis-
          sion  to  access  or change only the resources that have certain tag
          values.

          key -> (string)

              "KmsKeyArn": "string"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

                 The IDs of the security groups for this canary.

                 (string)

          VisualReference -> (structure)
              If  this  canary performs visual monitoring by comparing screen-
              shots, this structure contains the ID of the canary run  to  use
              as  the  baseline  for  screenshots,  and the coordinates of any
              parts of the screen to ignore during the visual monitoring  com-
              parison.

              BaseScreenshots -> (list)
                 An  array  of  screenshots  that are used as the baseline for
                 comparisons during visual monitoring.

                 (structure)
                     A structure representing a screenshot that is used  as  a
                     baseline during visual monitoring comparisons made by the
                     canary.

                     ScreenshotName -> (string)
                        The name of the  screenshot.  This  is  generated  the
                        first  time  the  canary is run after the UpdateCanary
                        operation that specified for this  canary  to  perform
                        visual monitoring.

                     IgnoreCoordinates -> (list)
                        Coordinates that define the part of a screen to ignore
                        during screenshot comparisons. To obtain  the  coordi-
                        nates  to use here, use the CloudWatch Logs console to
                        draw the boundaries on the screen. For  more  informa-

                        (string)

              BaseCanaryRunId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of the canary run that produced the screenshots that
                 are used as the baseline for  visual  monitoring  comparisons
                 during future runs of this canary.

          Tags -> (map)
              The list of key-value pairs that are associated with the canary.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          ArtifactConfig -> (structure)
              A structure that contains the  configuration  for  canary  arti-
              facts,  including  the encryption-at-rest settings for artifacts
              that the canary uploads to Amazon S3.

              S3Encryption -> (structure)
                 A structure that contains  the  configuration  of  encryption
                 settings for canary artifacts that are stored in Amazon S3.

                 EncryptionMode -> (string)
                     The  encryption  method  to  use for artifacts created by
                     this canary. Specify SSE_S3 to use server-side encryption
                     (SSE)  with  an Amazon S3-managed key. Specify SSE-KMS to
                     use server-side encryption with  a  customer-managed  KMS
                     key.

                     If  you  omit this parameter, an Amazon Web Services-man-
                     aged KMS key is used.

                 KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                     The ARN of the customer-managed KMS key to  use,  if  you
                     specify SSE-KMS for EncryptionMode
