DESCRIBE-CANARIES-LAST-RUN()                      DESCRIBE-CANARIES-LAST-RUN()



NAME
       describe-canaries-last-run -

DESCRIPTION
       Use  this operation to see information from the most recent run of each
       canary that you have created.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-canaries-last-run
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          A token that indicates that there is more data  available.  You  can
          use  this  token  in  a  subsequent  DescribeCanaries  operation  to
          retrieve the next set of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          Specify this parameter to limit how many runs are returned each time
          you  use  the DescribeLastRun operation. If you omit this parameter,
          the default of 100 is used.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CanariesLastRun -> (list)
          An array that contains the information from the most recent  run  of
          each canary.

          (structure)
              This structure contains information about the most recent run of
              a single canary.

              CanaryName -> (string)
                 The name of the canary.

              LastRun -> (structure)
                 The results from this canary's most recent run.

                 Id -> (string)
                     A unique ID that identifies this canary run.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name of the canary.

                 Status -> (structure)
                     The status of this run.

                     State -> (string)
                        The current state of the run.

                     StateReason -> (string)
                        If run of the canary failed, this field  contains  the
                        reason for the error.

                     StateReasonCode -> (string)
                        If   this  value  is  CANARY_FAILURE  ,  an  exception
                        occurred in the canary code. If this value  is  EXECU-
                        TION_FAILURE  ,  an  exception  occurred in CloudWatch
                        Synthetics.

                 Timeline -> (structure)
                     A structure that contains the start and end times of this
                     run.

                     Started -> (timestamp)
                        The start time of the run.

                     Completed -> (timestamp)
                        The end time of the run.

                 ArtifactS3Location -> (string)
                     The  location  where the canary stored artifacts from the
                     run. Artifacts include the log file, screenshots, and HAR
                     files.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates that there is more data available. You can
          use this token in a subsequent DescribeCanariesLastRun operation  to
          retrieve the next set of results.
