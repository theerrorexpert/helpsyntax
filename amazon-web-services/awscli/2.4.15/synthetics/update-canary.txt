OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the canary that you want to update. To find the names of
          your canaries, use DescribeCanaries .

          You cannot change the name of a canary that has  already  been  cre-
          ated.

       --code (structure)
          A  structure  that  includes  the  entry point from which the canary
          should start running your script. If the script is stored in  an  S3
          bucket, the bucket name, key, and version are also included.

          S3Bucket -> (string)
              If  your canary script is located in S3, specify the bucket name
              here. Do not include s3:// as the start of the bucket name.

          S3Key -> (string)
              The S3 key of your script. For  more  information,  see  Working
              with Amazon S3 Objects .

          S3Version -> (string)
              The S3 version ID of your script.

          ZipFile -> (blob)
              If you input your canary script directly into the canary instead
              of referring to an S3 location, the value of this  parameter  is
              the  base64-encoded  contents of the .zip file that contains the
              script. It must be smaller than 256 Kb.

          Handler -> (string)
              The entry point to use for the  source  code  when  running  the
              canary.  This  value  must  end  with  the string .handler . The
              string is limited to 29 characters or fewer.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Bucket=string,S3Key=string,S3Version=string,ZipFile=blob,Handler=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Bucket": "string",
            "S3Key": "string",
            "S3Version": "string",
            "ZipFile": blob,
            "Handler": "string"
          }

       --execution-role-arn (string)
          The ARN of the IAM role to be used to run the canary. This role must
          already  exist, and must include lambda.amazonaws.com as a principal
          in the trust policy. The role must also have the  following  permis-
          sions:

          o s3:PutObject

          o s3:GetBucketLocation

          o s3:ListAllMyBuckets

          o cloudwatch:PutMetricData

          o logs:CreateLogGroup

          o logs:CreateLogStream

          o logs:CreateLogStream

       --runtime-version (string)
          Specifies  the  runtime version to use for the canary. For a list of
          valid runtime versions and for more information about  runtime  ver-
          sions, see Canary Runtime Versions .

       --schedule (structure)
          A  structure that contains information about how often the canary is
          to run, and when these runs are to stop.

          Expression -> (string)
              A rate expression or a cron expression that  defines  how  often
              the canary is to run.

              For a rate expression, The syntax is rate(*number unit* ) . unit
              can be minute , minutes , or hour .

              For example, rate(1 minute)  runs  the  canary  once  a  minute,
              rate(10 minutes) runs it once every 10 minutes, and rate(1 hour)
              runs it once every hour. You can  specify  a  frequency  between
              rate(1 minute) and rate(1 hour) .

              Specifying  rate(0  minute)  or  rate(0 hour) is a special value
              that causes the canary to run only once when it is started.

              Use cron(*expression* ) to specify a cron expression. You  can't
              schedule  a  canary to wait for more than a year before running.
              For information about  the  syntax  for  cron  expressions,  see
              Scheduling canary runs using cron .

          DurationInSeconds -> (long)
              How  long, in seconds, for the canary to continue making regular
              runs according to the schedule in the Expression value.  If  you
              specify  0,  the canary continues making runs until you stop it.
              If you omit this field, the default of 0 is used.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Expression=string,DurationInSeconds=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Expression": "string",
            "DurationInSeconds": long
          }

       --run-config (structure)
          A structure that contains the timeout value that is  used  for  each
          individual run of the canary.

          TimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
              How  long  the canary is allowed to run before it must stop. You
              can't set this time to be longer than the frequency of the  runs
              of this canary.

              If  you  omit this field, the frequency of the canary is used as
              this value, up to a maximum of 14 minutes.

          MemoryInMB -> (integer)
              The maximum amount of memory available to the canary while it is
              running, in MB. This value must be a multiple of 64.

          ActiveTracing -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  this  canary  is to use active X-Ray tracing
              when it runs. Active tracing enables this canary run to be  dis-
              played  in  the  ServiceLens  and X-Ray service maps even if the
              canary does not hit an endpoint that has X-Ray tracing  enabled.
              Using  X-Ray  tracing  incurs charges. For more information, see
              Canaries and X-Ray tracing .

              You can enable active tracing only for canaries that use version
              syn-nodejs-2.0 or later for their canary runtime.

          EnvironmentVariables -> (map)
              Specifies  the  keys and values to use for any environment vari-
              ables used in the canary script. Use the following format:

              { "key1" : "value1", "key2" : "value2", ...}

              Keys must start with a letter and be at  least  two  characters.
              The total size of your environment variables cannot exceed 4 KB.
              You can't specify any Lambda reserved environment  variables  as
              the  keys  for  your environment variables. For more information
              about reserved keys, see Runtime environment variables .

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TimeoutInSeconds=integer,MemoryInMB=integer,ActiveTracing=boolean,EnvironmentVariables={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "TimeoutInSeconds": integer,
            "MemoryInMB": integer,
            "ActiveTracing": true|false,
            "EnvironmentVariables": {"string": "string"
              ...}
          }

       --success-retention-period-in-days (integer)
          The number of days to retain data  about  successful  runs  of  this
          canary.

       --failure-retention-period-in-days (integer)
          The  number of days to retain data about failed runs of this canary.

       --vpc-config (structure)
          If this canary is to test an endpoint in a VPC, this structure  con-
          tains  information  about  the subnet and security groups of the VPC
          endpoint. For more information, see Running a Canary in a VPC .

          SubnetIds -> (list)
              The IDs of the subnets where this canary is to run.

              (string)

            "SecurityGroupIds": ["string", ...]
          }

       --visual-reference (structure)
          Defines the screenshots to use as the baseline for comparisons  dur-
          ing visual monitoring comparisons during future runs of this canary.
          If you omit this parameter, no changes  are  made  to  any  baseline
          screenshots that the canary might be using already.

          Visual monitoring is supported only on canaries running the syn-pup-
          peteer-node-3.2 runtime or later. For more information,  see  Visual
          monitoring and Visual monitoring blueprint

          BaseScreenshots -> (list)
              An  array  of  screenshots that will be used as the baseline for
              visual monitoring in future runs of this canary. If there  is  a
              screenshot that you don't want to be used for visual monitoring,
              remove it from this array.

              (structure)
                 A structure representing a screenshot that is used as a base-
                 line during visual monitoring comparisons made by the canary.

                 ScreenshotName -> (string)
                     The name of the screenshot. This is generated  the  first
                     time  the  canary is run after the UpdateCanary operation
                     that specified for this canary to perform visual monitor-
                     ing.

                 IgnoreCoordinates -> (list)
                     Coordinates  that  define  the part of a screen to ignore
                     during screenshot comparisons. To obtain the  coordinates
                     to  use here, use the CloudWatch Logs console to draw the
                     boundaries on  the  screen.  For  more  information,  see

              Specifies  which  canary  run to use the screenshots from as the
              baseline for future visual monitoring with  this  canary.  Valid
              values  are  nextrun  to  use  the screenshots from the next run
              after this update is made, lastrun to use the  screenshots  from
              the most recent run before this update was made, or the value of
              Id in the CanaryRun from any past run of this canary.

       JSON Syntax:

            "BaseScreenshots": [
              {
                "ScreenshotName": "string",
                "IgnoreCoordinates": ["string", ...]
              }
              ...
            ],
            "BaseCanaryRunId": "string"
          }

       --artifact-s3-location (string)
          The location in Amazon S3 where Synthetics stores artifacts from the
          test  runs  of  this canary. Artifacts include the log file, screen-
          shots, and HAR files. The name of the  S3  bucket  can't  include  a
          period (.).

       --artifact-config (structure)
          A  structure  that  contains the configuration for canary artifacts,
          including the encryption-at-rest settings  for  artifacts  that  the
          canary uploads to Amazon S3.

          S3Encryption -> (structure)
              A  structure  that  contains  the  configuration  of the encryp-
              tion-at-rest settings for artifacts that the canary  uploads  to
              Amazon  S3.  Artifact encryption functionality is available only
              for canaries that use Synthetics runtime version syn-nodejs-pup-
              peteer-3.3 or later. For more information, see Encrypting canary
              artifacts

              EncryptionMode -> (string)
                 The encryption method to use for artifacts  created  by  this
                 canary.  Specify  SSE_S3  to use server-side encryption (SSE)
                 with  an  Amazon  S3-managed  key.  Specify  SSE-KMS  to  use
                 server-side encryption with a customer-managed KMS key.

                 If  you  omit  this parameter, an Amazon Web Services-managed
                 KMS key is used.

              KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the customer-managed KMS key to use, if you  spec-
                 ify SSE-KMS for EncryptionMode

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Encryption={EncryptionMode=string,KmsKeyArn=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Encryption": {
              "EncryptionMode": "SSE_S3"|"SSE_KMS",
              "KmsKeyArn": "string"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.
