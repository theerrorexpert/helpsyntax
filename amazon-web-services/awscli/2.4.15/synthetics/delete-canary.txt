DELETE-CANARY()                                                DELETE-CANARY()



NAME
       delete-canary -

DESCRIPTION
       Permanently deletes the specified canary.

       When  you delete a canary, resources used and created by the canary are
       not automatically deleted. After you delete a canary that  you  do  not
       intend to use again, you should also delete the following:

       o The  Lambda  functions and layers used by this canary. These have the
         prefix
         ``
         cwsyn-MyCanaryName `` .

       o The CloudWatch alarms created for this canary. These  alarms  have  a
         name of
         ``
         Synthetics-SharpDrop-Alarm-MyCanaryName `` .

       o Amazon  S3  objects  and buckets, such as the canary's artifact loca-
         tion.

       o IAM roles created for the canary. If they were created  in  the  con-
         sole, these roles have the name
         ``
         role/service-role/CloudWatchSyntheticsRole-MyCanaryName `` .

       o CloudWatch  Logs log groups created for the canary. These logs groups
         have the name
         ``
         /aws/lambda/cwsyn-MyCanaryName `` .

       Before you delete a canary, you might want to use GetCanary to  display
       the  information  about  this  canary.  Make  note  of  the information
       returned by this operation so that you can delete these resources after
       you delete the canary.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-canary
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the canary that you want to delete. To find the names of
          your canaries, use DescribeCanaries .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
