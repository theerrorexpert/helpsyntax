LIST-IP-ROUTES()                                              LIST-IP-ROUTES()



NAME
       list-ip-routes -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the address blocks that you have added to a directory.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-ip-routes  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: IpRoutesInfo

SYNOPSIS
            list-ip-routes
          --directory-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-id (string)
          Identifier (ID) of the directory for which you want to retrieve  the
          IP addresses.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       IpRoutesInfo -> (list)
          A list of  IpRoute s.

          (structure)
              Information about one or more IP address blocks.

              DirectoryId -> (string)
                 Identifier (ID) of  the  directory  associated  with  the  IP
                 addresses.

              CidrIp -> (string)
                 IP address block in the  IpRoute .

              IpRouteStatusMsg -> (string)
                 The status of the IP address block.

              AddedDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and time the address block was added to the direc-
                 tory.

              IpRouteStatusReason -> (string)
                 The reason for the IpRouteStatusMsg.

              Description -> (string)
                 Description of the  IpRouteInfo .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If not null, more results are available. Pass  this  value  for  the
          NextToken  parameter  in  a  subsequent  call  to   ListIpRoutes  to
          retrieve the next set of items.
