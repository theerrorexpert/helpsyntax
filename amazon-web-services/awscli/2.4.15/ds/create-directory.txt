CREATE-DIRECTORY()                                          CREATE-DIRECTORY()



NAME
       create-directory -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a Simple AD directory. For more information, see Simple Active
       Directory in the Directory Service Admin Guide .

       Before you call CreateDirectory , ensure that all of the required  per-
       missions  have  been  explicitly  granted through a policy. For details
       about what permissions are required to run the  CreateDirectory  opera-
       tion,  see  Directory  Service API Permissions: Actions, Resources, and
       Conditions Reference .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-directory
          --name <value>
          [--short-name <value>]
          --password <value>
          [--description <value>]
          --size <value>
          [--vpc-settings <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The fully qualified name for the directory, such as corp.example.com
          .

       --short-name (string)
          The NetBIOS name of the directory, such as CORP .

       --password (string)
          The password for the directory administrator. The directory creation
          process creates a directory administrator account with the user name
          Administrator and this password.

          If  you  need  to change the password for the administrator account,
          you can use the  ResetUserPassword API call.

          The regex pattern for this string is made up of the following condi-
          tions:

          o Length (?=^.{8,64}$)  Must be between 8 and 64 characters

          AND  any  3  of  the following password complexity rules required by
          Active Directory:

          o Numbers and upper case and lowercase (?=.*d)(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[a-z])

          o Numbers     and     special     characters    and    lower    case
            (?=.*d)(?=.*[^A-Za-z0-9s])(?=.*[a-z])

          o Special   characters   and   upper    case    and    lower    case
            (?=.*[^A-Za-z0-9s])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[a-z])

          o Numbers     and     upper     case    and    special    characters
            (?=.*d)(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[^A-Za-z0-9s])

          For additional information about how Active Directory passwords  are
          enforced,  see  Password  must  meet  complexity requirements on the
          Microsoft website.

       --description (string)
          A description for the directory.

       --size (string)
          The size of the directory.

          Possible values:

          o Small

          o Large

       --vpc-settings (structure)
          A  DirectoryVpcSettings object that contains additional  information
          for the operation.

          VpcId -> (string)
              The identifier of the VPC in which to create the directory.

          SubnetIds -> (list)
              The  identifiers  of  the subnets for the directory servers. The
              two subnets must be in different Availability  Zones.  Directory
              Service  creates  a directory server and a DNS server in each of
              these subnets.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          VpcId=string,SubnetIds=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "VpcId": "string",
            "SubnetIds": ["string", ...]
          }

       --tags (list)
          The tags to be assigned to the Simple AD directory.

          (structure)
              Metadata assigned to a directory consisting of a key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 Required  name  of  the  tag. The string value can be Unicode
                 characters and cannot be prefixed with "aws:". The string can
                 contain only the set of Unicode letters, digits, white-space,
                 '_',   '.',    '/',    '=',    '+',    '-'    (Java    regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 The  optional  value of the tag. The string value can be Uni-
                 code characters. The string can contain only the set of  Uni-
                 code  letters,  digits, white-space, '_', '.', '/', '=', '+',
                 '-' (Java regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DirectoryId -> (string)
          The identifier of the directory that was created.
