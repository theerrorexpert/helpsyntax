NAME
       describe-client-authentication-settings -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information  about the type of client authentication for the
       specified directory, if the type is specified. If no type is specified,
       information  about  all  client authentication types that are supported
       for the specified directory is retrieved. Currently, only SmartCard  is
       supported.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-client-authentication-settings
          --directory-id <value>
          [--type <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-id (string)
          The identifier of the directory for which to retrieve information.

       --type (string)
          The type of client authentication for which to retrieve information.
          If no type is specified, a list of all client  authentication  types
          that are supported for the specified directory is retrieved.

          Possible values:

          o SmartCard

       --next-token (string)
          The  DescribeClientAuthenticationSettingsResult.NextToken value from
          a previous call to  DescribeClientAuthenticationSettings . Pass null
          if this is the first call.

       --limit (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of items to return. If this value is zero, the
          maximum number of items is specified by the limitations of the oper-
          ation.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ClientAuthenticationSettingsInfo -> (list)
          Information  about  the type of client authentication for the speci-
          fied directory. The following information is retrieved: The date and
          time  when  the  status  of  the client authentication type was last
          updated, whether the client authentication type is enabled  or  dis-
          abled, and the type of client authentication.

          (structure)
              Contains  information about a client authentication method for a
              directory.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of client authentication for  the  specified  direc-
                 tory. If no type is specified, a list of all client authenti-
                 cation  types  that  are  supported  for  the  directory   is
                 retrieved.

              Status -> (string)
                 Whether the client authentication type is enabled or disabled
                 for the specified directory.

              LastUpdatedDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the status of the  client  authentica-
                 tion type was last updated.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  next  token used to retrieve the client authentication settings
          if the number of setting types  exceeds  page  limit  and  there  is
          another page.
