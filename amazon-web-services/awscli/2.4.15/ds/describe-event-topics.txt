DESCRIPTION
       Obtains  information  about which Amazon SNS topics receive status mes-

       this request describes all of the associations in the account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-event-topics
          [--directory-id <value>]
          [--topic-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-id (string)
          The  Directory ID for which to get the list of associated Amazon SNS
          topics. If this member is null, associations for all  Directory  IDs
          are returned.

       --topic-names (list)
          A  list  of  Amazon SNS topic names for which to obtain the informa-
          tion. If this member is null, all  associations  for  the  specified
          Directory ID are returned.

          An  empty list results in an InvalidParameterException being thrown.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
