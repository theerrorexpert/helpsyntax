NAME
       list-certificates -

DESCRIPTION
       For  the specified directory, lists all the certificates registered for
       a secure LDAP or client certificate authentication.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-certificates
          --directory-id <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-id (string)
          The identifier of the directory.

       --next-token (string)
          A token for requesting another page of certificates if the NextToken
          response element indicates that more certificates are available. Use
          the value of the returned NextToken element in  your  request  until
          the  token comes back as null . Pass null if this is the first call.

       --limit (integer)
          The number of items that should show up on one page

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          Indicates whether another page of certificates is available when the
          number of available certificates exceeds the page limit.

       CertificatesInfo -> (list)
          A  list of certificates with basic details including certificate ID,
          certificate common name, certificate state.

          (structure)
              Contains general information about a certificate.

              CertificateId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the certificate.

              CommonName -> (string)
                 The common name for the certificate.

              State -> (string)
                 The state of the certificate.

              ExpiryDateTime -> (timestamp)

                 The function that the registered certificate performs.  Valid
