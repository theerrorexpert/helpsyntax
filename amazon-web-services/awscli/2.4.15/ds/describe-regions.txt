DESCRIBE-REGIONS()                                          DESCRIBE-REGIONS()



NAME
       describe-regions -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides   information  about  the  Regions  that  are  configured  for
       multi-Region replication.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-regions
          --directory-id <value>
          [--region-name <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-id (string)
          The identifier of the directory.

       --region-name (string)
          The name of the Region. For example, us-east-1 .

       --next-token (string)
          The DescribeRegionsResult.NextToken value from a  previous  call  to
          DescribeRegions . Pass null if this is the first call.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RegionsDescription -> (list)
          List  of Region information related to the directory for each repli-
          cated Region.

          (structure)
              The replicated Region information for a directory.

              DirectoryId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the directory.

              RegionName -> (string)
                 The name of the Region. For example, us-east-1 .

              RegionType -> (string)
                 Specifies whether the Region is  the  primary  Region  or  an
                 additional Region.

              Status -> (string)
                 The  status  of  the  replication  process  for the specified
                 Region.

              VpcSettings -> (structure)
                 Contains VPC information for the   CreateDirectory  or   Cre-
                 ateMicrosoftAD operation.

                 VpcId -> (string)
                     The  identifier  of the VPC in which to create the direc-
                     tory.

                 SubnetIds -> (list)
                     The identifiers of the subnets for the directory servers.
                     The  two subnets must be in different Availability Zones.
                     Directory Service creates a directory server  and  a  DNS
                     server in each of these subnets.

                     (string)

              DesiredNumberOfDomainControllers -> (integer)
                 The  desired  number  of  domain controllers in the specified
                 Region for the specified directory.

              LaunchTime -> (timestamp)
                 Specifies when the Region replication began.

              StatusLastUpdatedDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the Region status was last updated.

              LastUpdatedDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and  time  that  the  Region  description  was  last
                 updated.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  not  null,  more  results are available. Pass this value for the
          NextToken parameter in a  subsequent  call  to   DescribeRegions  to
          retrieve the next set of items.
