NAME
       describe-domain-controllers -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides information about any domain controllers in your directory.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-domain-controllers  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: DomainControllers

SYNOPSIS
            describe-domain-controllers
          --directory-id <value>
          [--domain-controller-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-id (string)
          Identifier of the directory for which to retrieve  the  domain  con-
          troller information.

       --domain-controller-ids (list)
          A  list  of identifiers for the domain controllers whose information
          will be provided.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DomainControllers -> (list)
          List of the  DomainController objects that were retrieved.

          (structure)
              Contains  information  about the domain controllers for a speci-
              fied directory.

              DirectoryId -> (string)
                 Identifier of  the  directory  where  the  domain  controller
                 resides.

              DomainControllerId -> (string)
                 Identifies a specific domain controller in the directory.

              DnsIpAddr -> (string)
                 The IP address of the domain controller.

              VpcId -> (string)
                 The  identifier  of  the  VPC  that  contains the domain con-
                 troller.

              SubnetId -> (string)
                 Identifier of the subnet in the VPC that contains the  domain
                 controller.

              AvailabilityZone -> (string)
                 The Availability Zone where the domain controller is located.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the domain controller.

              StatusReason -> (string)
                 A description of the domain controller state.

              LaunchTime -> (timestamp)
                 Specifies when the domain controller was created.

              StatusLastUpdatedDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the status was last updated.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If not null, more results are available. Pass  this  value  for  the
          NextToken  parameter  in  a  subsequent  call to  DescribeDomainCon-
          trollers retrieve the next set of items.
