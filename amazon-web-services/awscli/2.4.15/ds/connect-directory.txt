       Shorthand Syntax:

          VpcId=string,SubnetIds=string,string,CustomerDnsIps=string,string,CustomerUserName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "VpcId": "string",
            "SubnetIds": ["string", ...],
            "CustomerDnsIps": ["string", ...],

          The tags to be assigned to AD Connector.

          (structure)
              Metadata assigned to a directory consisting of a key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 Required  name  of  the  tag. The string value can be Unicode
                 characters and cannot be prefixed with "aws:". The string can
                 contain only the set of Unicode letters, digits, white-space,
                 '_',   '.',    '/',    '=',    '+',    '-'    (Java    regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 The  optional  value of the tag. The string value can be Uni-

                 '-' (Java regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DirectoryId -> (string)
          The identifier of the new directory.
