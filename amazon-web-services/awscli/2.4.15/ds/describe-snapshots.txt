DESCRIBE-SNAPSHOTS()                                      DESCRIBE-SNAPSHOTS()



NAME
       describe-snapshots -

DESCRIPTION
       Obtains  information  about the directory snapshots that belong to this
       account.

       This operation supports  pagination  with  the  use  of  the  NextToken
       request  and  response  parameters.  If more results are available, the
       DescribeSnapshots.NextToken member contains a token that  you  pass  in
       the  next call to  DescribeSnapshots to retrieve the next set of items.

       You can also specify a maximum number of return results with the  Limit
       parameter.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-snapshots  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Snapshots

SYNOPSIS
            describe-snapshots
          [--directory-id <value>]
          [--snapshot-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-id (string)
          The identifier of the  directory  for  which  to  retrieve  snapshot
          information.

       --snapshot-ids (list)
          A  list  of  identifiers  of the snapshots to obtain the information
          for. If this member is null or empty,  all  snapshots  are  returned
          using the Limit and NextToken members.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Snapshots -> (list)
          The list of  Snapshot objects that were retrieved.

          It is possible that this list contains less than the number of items
          specified  in  the Limit member of the request. This occurs if there
          are less than the requested number of items left to retrieve, or  if
          the limitations of the operation have been exceeded.

          (structure)
              Describes a directory snapshot.

              DirectoryId -> (string)
                 The directory identifier.

              SnapshotId -> (string)
                 The snapshot identifier.

              Type -> (string)
                 The snapshot type.

              Name -> (string)
                 The descriptive name of the snapshot.

              Status -> (string)
                 The snapshot status.

              StartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the snapshot was taken.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  not  null,  more  results  are available. Pass this value in the
          NextToken member of a subsequent call to  DescribeSnapshots .
