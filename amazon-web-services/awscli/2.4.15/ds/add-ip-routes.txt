ADD-IP-ROUTES()                                                ADD-IP-ROUTES()



NAME
       add-ip-routes -

DESCRIPTION
       If the DNS server for your self-managed domain uses a publicly address-
       able IP address, you must add a CIDR address block to  correctly  route
       traffic  to  and  from  your  Microsoft  AD  on  Amazon  Web  Services.
       AddIpRoutes adds this address block. You can also  use  AddIpRoutes  to
       facilitate  routing  traffic  that  uses  public  IP  ranges  from your
       Microsoft AD on Amazon Web Services to a peer VPC.

       Before you call AddIpRoutes , ensure that all of the  required  permis-
       sions  have been explicitly granted through a policy. For details about
       what permissions are required to run  the  AddIpRoutes  operation,  see
       Directory  Service  API Permissions: Actions, Resources, and Conditions
       Reference .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            add-ip-routes
          --directory-id <value>
          --ip-routes <value>
          [--update-security-group-for-directory-controllers | --no-update-security-group-for-directory-controllers]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-id (string)
          Identifier (ID) of the directory to which to add the address  block.

       --ip-routes (list)
          IP  address blocks, using CIDR format, of the traffic to route. This
          is often the IP address block  of  the  DNS  server  used  for  your
          self-managed domain.

          (structure)
              IP  address  block.  This  is often the address block of the DNS
              server used for your self-managed domain.

              CidrIp -> (string)
                 IP address block using CIDR format, for example  10.0.0.0/24.
                 This  is  often  the address block of the DNS server used for
                 your self-managed domain. For a single IP address use a  CIDR
                 address block with /32. For example 10.0.0.0/32.

              Description -> (string)
                 Description of the address block.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CidrIp=string,Description=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "CidrIp": "string",
              "Description": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --update-security-group-for-directory-controllers  |  --no-update-secu-
       rity-group-for-directory-controllers (boolean)
          If set to true, updates the inbound and outbound rules of the  secu-
          rity  group  that  has the description: "Amazon Web Services created
          security group for directory ID  directory  controllers."  Following
          are the new rules:

          These  security  rules  impact an internal network interface that is
          not exposed publicly.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
