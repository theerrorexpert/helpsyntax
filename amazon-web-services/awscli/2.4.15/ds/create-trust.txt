CREATE-TRUST()                                                  CREATE-TRUST()



NAME
       create-trust -

DESCRIPTION
       Directory  Service for Microsoft Active Directory allows you to config-
       ure trust relationships. For example, you can establish a trust between
       your  Managed  Microsoft  AD  directory, and your existing self-managed
       Microsoft Active Directory. This would allow you to provide  users  and
       groups  access to resources in either domain, with a single set of cre-
       dentials.

       This action initiates the creation of the Amazon Web Services side of a
       trust  relationship  between  an  Managed Microsoft AD directory and an
       external domain. You can create either a forest trust  or  an  external
       trust.

SYNOPSIS
            create-trust
          --directory-id <value>
          --remote-domain-name <value>
          --trust-password <value>
          --trust-direction <value>
          [--trust-type <value>]
          [--conditional-forwarder-ip-addrs <value>]
          [--selective-auth <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-id (string)
          The  Directory ID of the Managed Microsoft AD directory for which to
          establish the trust relationship.

       --remote-domain-name (string)
          The Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the  external  domain  for
          which to create the trust relationship.

       --trust-password (string)
          The trust password. The must be the same password that was used when
          creating the trust relationship on the external domain.

       --trust-direction (string)
          The direction of the trust relationship.

          Possible values:

          o One-Way: Outgoing

          o One-Way: Incoming

          o Two-Way

       --trust-type (string)
          The trust relationship type. Forest is the default.

          Possible values:

          o Forest

          o External

       --conditional-forwarder-ip-addrs (list)
          The IP addresses of the remote DNS server associated with  RemoteDo-
          mainName.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --selective-auth (string)
          Optional parameter to enable selective authentication for the trust.

          Possible values:

          o Enabled

          o Disabled

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TrustId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the trust relationship that was created.
