NAME
       describe-conditional-forwarders -

DESCRIPTION
       Obtains  information about the conditional forwarders for this account.

       If no input parameters are provided for RemoteDomainNames, this request
       describes all conditional forwarders for the specified directory ID.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-conditional-forwarders
          --directory-id <value>
          [--remote-domain-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-id (string)
          The directory ID for which to get the list of associated conditional
          forwarders.

       --remote-domain-names (list)
          The fully qualified domain names (FQDN) of the  remote  domains  for
          which  to get the list of associated conditional forwarders. If this
          member is null, all conditional forwarders are returned.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ConditionalForwarders -> (list)
          The list of conditional forwarders that have been created.

          (structure)
              Points to a remote domain with which you are setting up a  trust
              relationship.  Conditional  forwarders  are required in order to
              set up a trust relationship with another domain.

              RemoteDomainName -> (string)
                 The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the remote  domains
                 pointed to by the conditional forwarder.

              DnsIpAddrs -> (list)
                 The  IP  addresses  of  the remote DNS server associated with
                 RemoteDomainName. This is the IP address of  the  DNS  server
                 that your conditional forwarder points to.

                 (string)

              ReplicationScope -> (string)
                 The  replication scope of the conditional forwarder. The only
                 allowed value is Domain , which  will  replicate  the  condi-
                 tional  forwarder  to  all of the domain controllers for your
                 Amazon Web Services directory.
