LIST-SPEECH-SYNTHESIS-TASKS()                    LIST-SPEECH-SYNTHESIS-TASKS()



NAME
       list-speech-synthesis-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of SpeechSynthesisTask objects ordered by their creation
       date. This operation can filter the tasks by their status, for example,
       allowing users to list only tasks that are completed.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-speech-synthesis-tasks  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: SynthesisTasks

SYNOPSIS
            list-speech-synthesis-tasks
          [--status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --status (string)
          Status of the speech synthesis tasks returned in a List operation

          Possible values:

          o scheduled

          o inProgress

          o completed

          o failed

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          An opaque pagination token returned from the previous List operation
          in this request. If present, this indicates where  to  continue  the
          listing.

       SynthesisTasks -> (list)
          List  of  SynthesisTask  objects  that provides information from the
          specified task in the list request, including  output  format,  cre-
          ation time, task status, and so on.

          (structure)
              SynthesisTask  object  that  provides information about a speech
              synthesis task.

              Engine -> (string)
                 Specifies the engine (standard or neural ) for  Amazon  Polly
                 to use when processing input text for speech synthesis. Using
                 a voice that is not supported for the  engine  selected  will
                 result in an error.

              TaskId -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Polly generated identifier for a speech synthesis
                 task.

              TaskStatus -> (string)
                 Current status of the individual speech synthesis task.

              TaskStatusReason -> (string)
                 Reason for the current status of a specific speech  synthesis
                 task, including errors if the task has failed.

              OutputUri -> (string)
                 Pathway for the output speech file.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 Timestamp for the time the synthesis task was started.

              RequestCharacters -> (integer)
                 Number of billable characters synthesized.

              SnsTopicArn -> (string)
                 ARN  for  the  SNS topic optionally used for providing status
                 notification for a speech synthesis task.

              LexiconNames -> (list)
                 List of one or more pronunciation lexicon names you want  the
                 service  to apply during synthesis. Lexicons are applied only
                 if the language of the lexicon is the same as the language of
                 the voice.

                 (string)

              OutputFormat -> (string)
                 The  format in which the returned output will be encoded. For
                 audio stream, this will  be  mp3,  ogg_vorbis,  or  pcm.  For
                 speech marks, this will be json.

              SampleRate -> (string)
                 The audio frequency specified in Hz.

                 The  valid values for mp3 and ogg_vorbis are "8000", "16000",
                 "22050", and "24000". The default value for  standard  voices
                 is "22050". The default value for neural voices is "24000".

                 Valid values for pcm are "8000" and "16000" The default value
                 is "16000".

              SpeechMarkTypes -> (list)
                 The type of speech marks returned for the input text.

                 (string)

              TextType -> (string)
                 Specifies whether the input text is plain text or  SSML.  The
                 default value is plain text.

              VoiceId -> (string)
                 Voice ID to use for the synthesis.

              LanguageCode -> (string)
                 Optional  language  code  for  a synthesis task. This is only
                 necessary if using a bilingual voice, such  as  Aditi,  which
                 can  be  used  for  either  Indian  English  (en-IN) or Hindi
                 (hi-IN).

                 If a bilingual voice is used and no language code  is  speci-
                 fied, Amazon Polly uses the default language of the bilingual
                 voice. The default language for any voice is the one returned
                 by  the DescribeVoices operation for the LanguageCode parame-
                 ter. For example, if no language  code  is  specified,  Aditi
                 will use Indian English rather than Hindi.
