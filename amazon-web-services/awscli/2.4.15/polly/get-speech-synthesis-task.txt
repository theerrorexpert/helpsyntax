GET-SPEECH-SYNTHESIS-TASK()                        GET-SPEECH-SYNTHESIS-TASK()



NAME
       get-speech-synthesis-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  specific  SpeechSynthesisTask object based on its TaskID.
       This object contains information about the given speech synthesis task,
       including  the status of the task, and a link to the S3 bucket contain-
       ing the output of the task.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-speech-synthesis-task
          --task-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --task-id (string)
          The Amazon Polly generated identifier for a speech synthesis task.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about a speech synthesis task

       The following get-speech-synthesis-task example  retrieves  information
       about the specified speech synthesis task.

          aws polly get-speech-synthesis-task \
              --task-id 70b61c0f-57ce-4715-a247-cae8729dcce9

       Output:

          {
              "SynthesisTask": {
                  "TaskId": "70b61c0f-57ce-4715-a247-cae8729dcce9",
                  "TaskStatus": "completed",
                  "OutputUri": "https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/my-s3-bucket/70b61c0f-57ce-4715-a247-cae8729dcce9.mp3",
                  "CreationTime": 1603911042.689,
                  "RequestCharacters": 1311,
                  "OutputFormat": "mp3",
                  "TextType": "text",
                  "VoiceId": "Joanna"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       SynthesisTask -> (structure)
          SynthesisTask object that provides information  from  the  requested
          task,  including  output  format, creation time, task status, and so
          on.

          Engine -> (string)
              Specifies the engine (standard or neural ) for Amazon  Polly  to
              use  when  processing  input  text for speech synthesis. Using a
              voice that is not supported for the engine selected will  result
              in an error.

          TaskId -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Polly  generated  identifier for a speech synthesis
              task.

          TaskStatus -> (string)
              Current status of the individual speech synthesis task.

          TaskStatusReason -> (string)
              Reason for the current status of  a  specific  speech  synthesis
              task, including errors if the task has failed.

          OutputUri -> (string)
              Pathway for the output speech file.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              Timestamp for the time the synthesis task was started.

          RequestCharacters -> (integer)
              Number of billable characters synthesized.

          SnsTopicArn -> (string)
              ARN for the SNS topic optionally used for providing status noti-
              fication for a speech synthesis task.

          LexiconNames -> (list)
              List of one or more pronunciation lexicon  names  you  want  the
              service  to apply during synthesis. Lexicons are applied only if
              the language of the lexicon is the same as the language  of  the
              voice.

              (string)

          OutputFormat -> (string)
              The  format  in  which  the returned output will be encoded. For
              audio stream, this will be mp3, ogg_vorbis, or pcm.  For  speech
              marks, this will be json.

          SampleRate -> (string)
              The audio frequency specified in Hz.

              The  valid  values  for  mp3 and ogg_vorbis are "8000", "16000",
              "22050", and "24000". The default value for standard  voices  is
              "22050". The default value for neural voices is "24000".

              Valid values for pcm are "8000" and "16000" The default value is
              "16000".

          SpeechMarkTypes -> (list)
              The type of speech marks returned for the input text.

              (string)

          TextType -> (string)
              Specifies whether the input text is  plain  text  or  SSML.  The
              default value is plain text.

          VoiceId -> (string)
              Voice ID to use for the synthesis.

          LanguageCode -> (string)
              Optional language code for a synthesis task. This is only neces-
              sary if using a bilingual voice, such as  Aditi,  which  can  be
              used for either Indian English (en-IN) or Hindi (hi-IN).

              If  a bilingual voice is used and no language code is specified,
              Amazon Polly uses the default language of the  bilingual  voice.
              The  default  language  for any voice is the one returned by the
              DescribeVoices operation for  the  LanguageCode  parameter.  For
              example, if no language code is specified, Aditi will use Indian
              English rather than Hindi.
