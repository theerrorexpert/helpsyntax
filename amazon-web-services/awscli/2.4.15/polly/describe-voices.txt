DESCRIBE-VOICES()                                            DESCRIBE-VOICES()



NAME
       describe-voices -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  list of voices that are available for use when requesting
       speech synthesis. Each voice speaks a  specified  language,  is  either
       male  or female, and is identified by an ID, which is the ASCII version
       of the voice name.

       When synthesizing speech ( SynthesizeSpeech ), you provide the voice ID
       for   the   voice  you  want  from  the  list  of  voices  returned  by
       DescribeVoices .

       For example, you want your news reader application to read  news  in  a
       specific  language,  but  giving a user the option to choose the voice.
       Using the DescribeVoices operation you can provide the user with a list
       of available voices to select from.

       You  can  optionally  specify  a  language code to filter the available
       voices. For example, if you specify en-US ,  the  operation  returns  a
       list of all available US English voices.

       This operation requires permissions to perform the polly:DescribeVoices
       action.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-voices is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Voices

       --include-additional-language-codes    |   --no-include-additional-lan-
       guage-codes (boolean)
          Boolean value indicating whether to return any bilingual voices that
          use  the specified language as an additional language. For instance,
          if you request all languages that use US English (es-US), and  there
          is an Italian voice that speaks both Italian (it-IT) and US English,
          that voice will be included if you specify yes but not if you  spec-
          ify no .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Voices -> (list)
          A list of voices with their properties.

          (structure)
              Description of the voice.

              Gender -> (string)
                 Gender of the voice.

              Id -> (string)
                 Amazon Polly assigned voice ID. This is the ID that you spec-
                 ify when calling the SynthesizeSpeech operation.

              LanguageCode -> (string)
                 Language code of the voice.

              LanguageName -> (string)
                 Human readable name of the language in English.

              Name -> (string)
                 Name of the voice (for example, Salli,  Kendra,  etc.).  This
                 provides  a  human readable voice name that you might display
                 in your application.

              AdditionalLanguageCodes -> (list)
                 Additional codes for languages available  for  the  specified
                 voice in addition to its default language.

                 For example, the default language for Aditi is Indian English
                 (en-IN) because it was first used for  that  language.  Since
                 Aditi  is  bilingual  and  fluent  in both Indian English and
                 Hindi, this parameter would show the code hi-IN .

                 (string)

              SupportedEngines -> (list)
                 Specifies which engines (standard or neural ) that  are  sup-
                 ported by a given voice.

                 (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  pagination  token  to  use  in the next request to continue the
          listing of voices. NextToken is returned only  if  the  response  is
          truncated.
