NAME
       dax -

DESCRIPTION
       DAX  is  a  managed caching service engineered for Amazon DynamoDB. DAX
       dramatically speeds up database reads  by  caching  frequently-accessed
       data  from DynamoDB, so applications can access that data with sub-mil-
       lisecond latency. You can create a DAX cluster easily,  using  the  AWS
       Management  Console. With a few simple modifications to your code, your
       application can begin taking advantage of the DAX cluster  and  realize
       significant improvements in read performance.
