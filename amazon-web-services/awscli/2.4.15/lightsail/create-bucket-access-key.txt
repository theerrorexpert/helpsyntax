CREATE-BUCKET-ACCESS-KEY()                          CREATE-BUCKET-ACCESS-KEY()



NAME
       create-bucket-access-key -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new  access  key for the specified Amazon Lightsail bucket.
       Access keys consist of an access key ID and corresponding secret access
       key.

       Access  keys grant full programmatic access to the specified bucket and
       its objects. You can have a maximum of two access keys per bucket.  Use
       the   GetBucketAccessKeys  action  to get a list of current access keys
       for a specific bucket. For more  information  about  access  keys,  see
       Creating  access  keys  for  a bucket in Amazon Lightsail in the Amazon
       Lightsail Developer Guide .

       WARNING:
          The secretAccessKey value is returned only in response to  the  Cre-
          ateBucketAccessKey action. You can get a secret access key only when
          you first create an access key; you cannot get the secret access key
          later.  If  you  lose  the  secret access key, you must create a new
          access key.

SYNOPSIS
            create-bucket-access-key
          --bucket-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket-name (string)
          The name of the bucket that the new access key will belong  to,  and
          grant access to.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       accessKey -> (structure)
          An object that describes the access key that is created.

          accessKeyId -> (string)
              The ID of the access key.

          secretAccessKey -> (string)
              The secret access key used to sign requests.

              You  should  store  the secret access key in a safe location. We
              recommend that you delete the access key if  the  secret  access
              key is compromised.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the access key.

              A  status  of Active means that the key is valid, while Inactive
              means it is not.

          createdAt -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp when the access key was created.

          lastUsed -> (structure)
              An object that describes the last time the access key was  used.

              NOTE:
                 This  object does not include data in the response of a  Cre-
                 ateBucketAccessKey action. If the access  key  has  not  been
                 used,  the  region  and  serviceName values are N/A , and the
                 lastUsedDate value is null.

              lastUsedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the access key was most recently used.

                 This value is null if the access key has not been used.

              region -> (string)
                 The  AWS Region where this access key was most recently used.

                 This value is N/A if the access key has not been used.

              serviceName -> (string)
                 The name of the AWS service with which this  access  key  was
                 most recently used.

                 This value is N/A if the access key has not been used.

       operations -> (list)
          An  array of objects that describe the result of the action, such as
          the status of the request, the timestamp of  the  request,  and  the
          resources affected by the request.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
