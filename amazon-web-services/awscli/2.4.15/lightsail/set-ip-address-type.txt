SET-IP-ADDRESS-TYPE()                                    SET-IP-ADDRESS-TYPE()



NAME
       set-ip-address-type -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets the IP address type for an Amazon Lightsail resource.

       Use this action to enable dual-stack for a resource, which enables IPv4
       and IPv6 for the specified resource.  Alternately,  you  can  use  this
       action to disable dual-stack, and enable IPv4 only.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       --resource-name (string)
          The name of the resource for which to set the IP address type.

       --ip-address-type (string)
          The IP address type to set for the specified resource.

          The possible values are ipv4 for IPv4 only, and dualstack  for  IPv4
          and IPv6.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
