CREATE-CERTIFICATE()                                      CREATE-CERTIFICATE()



NAME
       create-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an SSL/TLS certificate for an Amazon Lightsail content delivery
       network (CDN) distribution and a container service.

       After the certificate is valid, use the AttachCertificateToDistribution
       action  to  use the certificate and its domains with your distribution.
       Or use the UpdateContainerService action to use the certificate and its
       domains with your container service.

       WARNING:
          Only  certificates  created  in  the  us-east-1  AWS  Region  can be
          attached to Lightsail  distributions.  Lightsail  distributions  are
          global resources that can reference an origin in any AWS Region, and
          distribute its content  globally.  However,  all  distributions  are
          located in the us-east-1 Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-name (string)
          The name for the certificate.

       --domain-name (string)
          The domain name (e.g., example.com ) for the certificate.

       --subject-alternative-names (list)
          An  array of strings that specify the alternate domains (e.g., exam-
          ple2.com ) and subdomains (e.g., blog.example.com ) for the certifi-
          cate.

          You  can specify a maximum of nine alternate domains (in addition to
          the primary domain name).

          Wildcard domain entries (e.g., *.example.com ) are not supported.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          The tag keys and optional values to add to  the  certificate  during
          create.

          Use the TagResource action to tag a resource after it's created.

          (structure)
              Describes  a  tag  key  and optional value assigned to an Amazon
              Lightsail resource.

              For more information about tags in  Lightsail,  see  the  Amazon
              Lightsail Developer Guide .

              key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

                 Constraints:  Tag  keys accept a maximum of 128 letters, num-
                 bers, spaces in UTF-8, or the following characters: + - = . _
                 : / @

              value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

                 Constraints: Tag values accept a maximum of 256 letters, num-
                 bers, spaces in UTF-8, or the following characters: + - = . _
                 : / @

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 o
                   **
                   NO_AVAILABLE_CONTACTS ** - This failure  applies  to  email
                   validation,  which  is not available for Lightsail certifi-
                   cates.

                 o
                   **
                   ADDITIONAL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED **  -  Lightsail  requires
                   additional information to process this certificate request.
                   This can happen as a fraud-protection measure, such as when
                   the  domain  ranks  within  the Alexa top 1000 websites. To
                   provide the required information, use the AWS Support  Cen-
                   ter to contact AWS Support.

                 NOTE:
                     You  cannot request a certificate for Amazon-owned domain
                     names such  as  those  ending  in  amazonaws.com,  cloud-
                     front.net, or elasticbeanstalk.com.

                 o
                   **
                   DOMAIN_NOT_ALLOWED  ** - One or more of the domain names in
                   the certificate request was reported as an unsafe domain by
                   VirusTotal . To correct the problem, search for your domain
                   name on the VirusTotal website. If your domain is  reported
                   as suspicious, see Google Help for Hacked Websites to learn
                   what you can do. If you believe that the result is a  false
                   positive,  notify  the  organization  that is reporting the
                   domain. VirusTotal is an aggregate of several antivirus and
                   URL  scanners  and  cannot  remove your domain from a block
                   list itself. After you correct the problem and the VirusTo-
                   tal  registry  has been updated, request a new certificate.
                   If you see this error and your domain is  not  included  in
                   the  VirusTotal list, visit the AWS Support Center and cre-
                   ate a case.

                 o
                   **
                   INVALID_PUBLIC_DOMAIN ** - One or more of the domain  names
                   in the certificate request is not valid. Typically, this is
                   because a domain  name  in  the  request  is  not  a  valid
                   top-level  domain. Try to request a certificate again, cor-
                   recting any spelling errors  or  typos  that  were  in  the
                   failed  request,  and  ensure  that all domain names in the
                   request are for valid top-level domains. For  example,  you
                   cannot  request  a certificate for example.invalidpublicdo-
                   main because invalidpublicdomain is not a  valid  top-level
                   domain.

                 o
                   **
                   OTHER  **  - Typically, this failure occurs when there is a
                   typographical error in one or more of the domain  names  in
                   the  certificate  request.  Try  to  request  a certificate
                   again, correcting any spelling errors or typos that were in
                   the failed request.

              inUseResourceCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  Lightsail  resources that the certificate is
                 attached to.

              keyAlgorithm -> (string)
                 The algorithm used to generate the key pair (the  public  and
                 private key) of the certificate.

                       **
                       PendingAutoRenewal **  -  Lightsail  is  attempting  to
                       automatically validate the domain names of the certifi-
                       cate. No further action is required.

                     o
                       **
                       PendingValidation ** - Lightsail couldn't automatically
                       validate  one  or more domain names of the certificate.
                       You must take action to validate these domain names  or
                       the  certificate  won't  be renewed. Check to make sure
                       your certificate's domain validation records  exist  in
                       your domain's DNS, and that your certificate remains in
                       use.

                     o
                       **
                       Success ** - All domain names in  the  certificate  are
                       validated,  and  Lightsail  renewed the certificate. No
                       further action is required.

                     o
                       **
                       Failed ** - One or more domain names were not validated
                       before  the  certificate expired, and Lightsail did not
                       renew the certificate. You can request a  new  certifi-
