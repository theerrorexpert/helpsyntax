GET-DOMAIN()                                                      GET-DOMAIN()



NAME
       get-domain -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about a specific domain recordset.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-domain
          --domain-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The domain name for which your want to return information about.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about a domain

       The  following  get-domain  example  displays  details about the domain
       example.com.

       Note: Lightsail's domain-related API operations are available  in  only
       the  us-east-1  AWS  Region. If your CLI profile is configured to use a
       different Region, you must include the`` --region us-east-1`` parameter
       or the command fails.

          aws lightsail get-domain \
              --domain-name example.com \
              --region us-east-1

                     include an alias (A type) record in your  request,  which
                     points  to a load balancer DNS name and routes traffic to
                     your load balancer.

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of domain entry, such as address for  IPv4  (A),

                     o A

                     o AAAA

                     o CNAME

                     o MX

                     o NS

                     NOTE:
                        In releases prior to November 29, 2017, this parameter
                        was not included in the API response. It is now depre-
                        cated.
