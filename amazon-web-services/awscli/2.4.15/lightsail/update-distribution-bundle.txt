UPDATE-DISTRIBUTION-BUNDLE()                      UPDATE-DISTRIBUTION-BUNDLE()



NAME
       update-distribution-bundle -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the  bundle  of your Amazon Lightsail content delivery network
       (CDN) distribution.

       A distribution bundle specifies the monthly network transfer quota  and
       monthly cost of your dsitribution.

       Update  your  distribution's  bundle if your distribution is going over
       its monthly network transfer quota and is incurring an overage fee.

       You can update your distribution's bundle only  one  time  within  your
       monthly  AWS billing cycle. To determine if you can update your distri-
       bution's bundle, use the GetDistributions action. The  ableToUpdateBun-
       dle  parameter  in  the  result will indicate whether you can currently
       update your distribution's bundle.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-distribution-bundle
          [--distribution-name <value>]
          [--bundle-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --distribution-name (string)
          The name of the distribution for which to update the bundle.

          Use the GetDistributions action to get a list of distribution  names
          that you can specify.

       --bundle-id (string)
          The bundle ID of the new bundle to apply to your distribution.

          Use  the GetDistributionBundles action to get a list of distribution
          bundle IDs that you can specify.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
