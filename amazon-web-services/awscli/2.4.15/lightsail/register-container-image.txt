DESCRIPTION
       Registers a container image to your Amazon Lightsail container service.

       NOTE:
          This action is not required if you install  and  use  the  Lightsail
          Control  (lightsailctl)  plugin  to  push  container  images to your
          Lightsail container service. For more information, see  Pushing  and
          managing  container  images  on your Amazon Lightsail container ser-
          vices in the Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            register-container-image
          --service-name <value>
          --label <value>
          --digest <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --service-name (string)
          The name of the container service for which to register a  container
          image.

       --label (string)
          The  label  for the container image when it's registered to the con-
          tainer service.

          Use a descriptive label that you can use to track the different ver-
          sions of your registered container images.

          Use  the  GetContainerImages  action  to return the container images
          registered to a  Lightsail  container  service.  The  label  is  the
          <imagelabel> portion of the following image name example:

          o :container-service-1.<imagelabel>.1

          If  the  name  of your container service is mycontainerservice , and
          the label that you specify is mystaticwebsite , then the name of the
          registered  container image will be :mycontainerservice.mystaticweb-
          site.1 .

          The number at the end of these image name  examples  represents  the
          version  of the registered container image. If you push and register
          another container image to the  same  Lightsail  container  service,
          with  the same label, then the version number for the new registered
          container image will be 2 . If you push and  register  another  con-
          tainer image, the version number will be 3 , and so on.

       --digest (string)
          The digest of the container image to be registered.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
