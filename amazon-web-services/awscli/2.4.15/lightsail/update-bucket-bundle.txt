UPDATE-BUCKET-BUNDLE()                                  UPDATE-BUCKET-BUNDLE()



NAME
       update-bucket-bundle -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the  bundle,  or storage plan, of an existing Amazon Lightsail
       bucket.

       A bucket bundle specifies the monthly cost,  storage  space,  and  data
       transfer  quota for a bucket. You can update a bucket's bundle only one
       time within a monthly AWS billing cycle. To determine if you can update
       a  bucket's  bundle, use the  GetBuckets action. The ableToUpdateBundle
       parameter in the response  will  indicate  whether  you  can  currently
       update a bucket's bundle.

       Update  a  bucket's  bundle if it's consistently going over its storage
       space or data transfer quota, or if a bucket's usage is consistently in
       the lower range of its storage space or data transfer quota. Due to the
       unpredictable usage fluctuations that a  bucket  might  experience,  we
       strongly  recommend  that  you  update  a  bucket's  bundle  only  as a
       long-term strategy, instead of as a  short-term,  monthly  cost-cutting
       measure. Choose a bucket bundle that will provide the bucket with ample
       storage space and data transfer for a long time to come.

SYNOPSIS
            update-bucket-bundle
          --bucket-name <value>
          --bundle-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket-name (string)
          The name of the bucket for which to update the bundle.

       --bundle-id (string)
          The ID of the new bundle to apply to the bucket.

          Use the  GetBucketBundles action to get a list of  bundle  IDs  that
          you can specify.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
