ATTACH-LOAD-BALANCER-TLS-CERTIFICATE()  ATTACH-LOAD-BALANCER-TLS-CERTIFICATE()



NAME
       attach-load-balancer-tls-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Attaches a Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate to your load bal-
       ancer. TLS is just an updated, more secure  version  of  Secure  Socket
       Layer (SSL).

       Once  you  create  and  validate your certificate, you can attach it to
       your load balancer. You can also use this API to  rotate  the  certifi-
       cates  on your account. Use the AttachLoadBalancerTlsCertificate action
       with the non-attached certificate, and it will replace the existing one
       and become the attached certificate.

       The   AttachLoadBalancerTlsCertificate   operation  supports  tag-based
       access control via resource tags applied to the resource identified  by
       load  balancer  name  .  For more information, see the Amazon Lightsail
       Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            attach-load-balancer-tls-certificate
          --load-balancer-name <value>
          --certificate-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --load-balancer-name (string)
          The name of the load balancer to which you  want  to  associate  the
          SSL/TLS certificate.

       --certificate-name (string)
          The name of your SSL/TLS certificate.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To attach a TLS certificate to a load balancer

       The following attach-load-balancer-tls-certificate example attaches the
       load balancer TLS certificate Certificate2 to the load  balancer  Load-
       Balancer-1.

          aws lightsail attach-load-balancer-tls-certificate \
              --certificate-name Certificate2 \
              --load-balancer-name LoadBalancer-1

OUTPUT
       operations -> (list)
          An  array of objects that describe the result of the action, such as
          the status of the request, the timestamp of  the  request,  and  the
          resources affected by the request.

          These  SSL/TLS  certificates  are only usable by Lightsail load bal-
          ancers. You can't get the certificate and use it  for  another  pur-
          pose.
