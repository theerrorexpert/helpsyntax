TEST-ALARM()                                                      TEST-ALARM()



NAME
       test-alarm -

DESCRIPTION
       Tests  an alarm by displaying a banner on the Amazon Lightsail console.
       If a notification trigger is configured for the  specified  alarm,  the
       test  also  sends  a  notification  to the notification protocol (Email
       and/or SMS ) configured for the alarm.

       An alarm is used to monitor a single metric for one of your  resources.
       When  a metric condition is met, the alarm can notify you by email, SMS
       text message, and a banner displayed on the Amazon  Lightsail  console.
       For more information, see Alarms in Amazon Lightsail .

SYNOPSIS
            test-alarm
          --alarm-name <value>
          --state <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --alarm-name (string)
          The name of the alarm to test.

       --state (string)
          The alarm state to test.

          An alarm has the following possible states that can be tested:

          o ALARM - The metric is outside of the defined threshold.

          o INSUFFICIENT_DATA  - The alarm has just started, the metric is not
            available, or not enough data  is  available  for  the  metric  to
            determine the alarm state.

          o OK - The metric is within the defined threshold.

          Possible values:

          o OK

          o ALARM

          o INSUFFICIENT_DATA

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
