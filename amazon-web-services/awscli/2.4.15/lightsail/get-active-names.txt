GET-ACTIVE-NAMES()                                          GET-ACTIVE-NAMES()



NAME
       get-active-names -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the names of all active (not deleted) resources.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-active-names  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: activeNames

SYNOPSIS
            get-active-names
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get active resource names

       The following get-active-names  example  returns  the  active  resource
       names in the configured AWS Region.

          aws lightsail get-active-names

       Output:

          {
              "activeNames": [
                  "WordPress-1",
                  "StaticIp-1",
                  "MEAN-1",
                  "Plesk_Hosting_Stack_on_Ubuntu-1"
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       activeNames -> (list)
          The list of active names returned by the get active names request.

          (string)

       nextPageToken -> (string)
          The  token to advance to the next page of results from your request.

          A next page token is not returned if there are no  more  results  to
          display.

          To  get  the  next  page  of results, perform another GetActiveNames
          request and specify the next page token using the pageToken  parame-
          ter.
