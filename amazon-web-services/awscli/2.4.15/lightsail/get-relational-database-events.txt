GET-RELATIONAL-DATABASE-EVENTS()              GET-RELATIONAL-DATABASE-EVENTS()



NAME
       get-relational-database-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of events for a specific database in Amazon Lightsail.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-relational-database-events  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: relationalDatabaseEvents

SYNOPSIS
            get-relational-database-events
          --relational-database-name <value>
          [--duration-in-minutes <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --relational-database-name (string)
          The name of the database from which to get events.

       --duration-in-minutes (integer)
          The number of minutes in the past from which to retrieve events. For
          example, to get all events from the past 2 hours, enter 120.

          Default: 60

          The minimum is 1 and the maximum is 14 days (20160 minutes).

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the events for a relational database

       The  following  get-relational-database-events example displays details
       about events in the last 17 hours  (1020  minutes)  for  the  specified
       relational database.

          aws lightsail get-relational-database-events \
              --relational-database-name Database-1 \
              --duration-in-minutes 1020

       Output:

          {
              "relationalDatabaseEvents": [
                  {
                      "resource": "Database-1",
                      "createdAt": 1571654146.553,
                      "message": "Backing up Relational Database",
                      "eventCategories": [
                          "backup"
                      ]
                  },
                  {
                      "resource": "Database-1",
                      "createdAt": 1571654249.98,
                      "message": "Finished Relational Database backup",
                      "eventCategories": [
                          "backup"
                      ]
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       relationalDatabaseEvents -> (list)
          An  object  describing  the  result  of your get relational database
          events request.

          (structure)
              Describes an event for a database.

              resource -> (string)
                 The database that the database event relates to.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp when the database event was created.

              message -> (string)
                 The message of the database event.

              eventCategories -> (list)
                 The category that the database event belongs to.

                 (string)

       nextPageToken -> (string)
          The token to advance to the next page of results from your  request.

          A  next  page  token is not returned if there are no more results to
          display.

          To get the next page  of  results,  perform  another  GetRelational-
          DatabaseEvents  request  and  specify  the next page token using the
          pageToken parameter.
