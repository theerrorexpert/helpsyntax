NAME
       attach-certificate-to-distribution -

DESCRIPTION
       Attaches an SSL/TLS certificate to your Amazon Lightsail content deliv-
       ery network (CDN) distribution.

       After the certificate is  attached,  your  distribution  accepts  HTTPS
       traffic  for  all  of the domains that are associated with the certifi-
       cate.

       Use the CreateCertificate action to create a certificate that  you  can
       attach to your distribution.

       WARNING:
          Only  certificates  created  in  the  us-east-1  AWS  Region  can be
          attached to Lightsail  distributions.  Lightsail  distributions  are
          global resources that can reference an origin in any AWS Region, and
          distribute its content  globally.  However,  all  distributions  are
          located in the us-east-1 Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            attach-certificate-to-distribution
          --distribution-name <value>
          --certificate-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --distribution-name (string)
          The  name  of the distribution that the certificate will be attached
          to.

          Use the GetDistributions action to get a list of distribution  names
          that you can specify.

       --certificate-name (string)
          The name of the certificate to attach to a distribution.

          Only  certificates with a status of ISSUED can be attached to a dis-
          tribution.

          Use the GetCertificates action to get a list  of  certificate  names
          that you can specify.

          NOTE:
              This  is  the  name of the certificate resource type and is used
              only to reference the certificate in other API actions.  It  can
              be  different than the domain name of the certificate. For exam-
              ple, your certificate name might  be  WordPress-Blog-Certificate
              and the domain name of the certificate might be example.com .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
