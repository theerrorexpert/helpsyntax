UPDATE-RELATIONAL-DATABASE()                      UPDATE-RELATIONAL-DATABASE()



NAME
       update-relational-database -

DESCRIPTION
       Allows  the  update  of  one or more attributes of a database in Amazon
       Lightsail.

       Updates are applied immediately, or in cases where  the  updates  could
       result in an outage, are applied during the database's predefined main-
       tenance window.

       The update relational database operation supports tag-based access con-
       trol  via resource tags applied to the resource identified by relation-
       alDatabaseName. For more information, see the Amazon  Lightsail  Devel-
       oper Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --relational-database-name (string)
          The name of your Lightsail database resource to update.

       --master-user-password (string)
          The  password  for  the  master  user.  The password can include any
          printable ASCII character except "/", """, or "@".

          My**SQL**

          Constraints: Must contain from 8 to 41 characters.
              PostgreSQL

          Constraints: Must contain from 8 to 128 characters.

       --rotate-master-user-password    |     --no-rotate-master-user-password
       (boolean)
          When  true  ,  the  master  user password is changed to a new strong
          password generated by Lightsail.

          Use the get relational database master user  password  operation  to
          get the new password.

       --preferred-backup-window (string)
          The  daily time range during which automated backups are created for
          your database if automated backups are enabled.

          Constraints:

          o Must be in the hh24:mi-hh24:mi format. Example: 16:00-16:30

          o Specified in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          o Must not conflict with the preferred maintenance window.

          o Must be at least 30 minutes.

       --preferred-maintenance-window (string)
          The weekly time range during which system maintenance can  occur  on
          your database.

          The  default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour
          block of time for each AWS Region, occurring on a random day of  the
          week.

          Constraints:

          o Must be in the ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi format.

          o Valid days: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun.

          o Must be at least 30 minutes.

          o Specified in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          o Example: Tue:17:00-Tue:17:30

       --enable-backup-retention | --no-enable-backup-retention (boolean)
          When true , enables automated backup retention for your database.

          Updates  are applied during the next maintenance window because this
          can result in an outage.

       --disable-backup-retention | --no-disable-backup-retention (boolean)
          When true , disables automated backup retention for your database.

          Disabling backup retention deletes all automated  database  backups.
          Before  disabling  this,  you  may want to create a snapshot of your
          database using the create relational database snapshot operation.

          Updates are applied during the next maintenance window because  this
          can result in an outage.

       --publicly-accessible | --no-publicly-accessible (boolean)
          Specifies  the  accessibility  options for your database. A value of
          true specifies a database that is available to resources outside  of
          your  Lightsail  account. A value of false specifies a database that
          is available only to your Lightsail resources in the same region  as
          your database.

       --apply-immediately | --no-apply-immediately (boolean)
          When  true  ,  applies  changes  immediately.  When  false , applies
          changes during the preferred maintenance window.  Some  changes  may
          cause an outage.

          Default: false

       --ca-certificate-identifier (string)
          Indicates the certificate that needs to be associated with the data-
          base.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
