GET-LOAD-BALANCER-TLS-CERTIFICATES()      GET-LOAD-BALANCER-TLS-CERTIFICATES()



NAME
       get-load-balancer-tls-certificates -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about the TLS certificates that are associated with
       the specified Lightsail load balancer.

       TLS is just an updated, more secure  version  of  Secure  Socket  Layer
       (SSL).

       You  can  have  a maximum of 2 certificates associated with a Lightsail
       load balancer. One is active and the other is inactive.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-load-balancer-tls-certificates
          --load-balancer-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --load-balancer-name (string)
          The name of the load balancer you associated with your SSL/TLS  cer-
          tificate.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about TLS certificates for a load balancer

       The   following   get-load-balancer-tls-certificates  example  displays
       details about the TLS certificates for the specified load balancer.

          aws lightsail get-load-balancer-tls-certificates \
              --load-balancer-name LoadBalancer-1

                 The following failure reasons are possible:

                 o
                   **
                   NO_AVAILABLE_CONTACTS ** - This failure  applies  to  email
                   validation,  which  is not available for Lightsail certifi-
                   cates.

                 o
                   **
                   ADDITIONAL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED **  -  Lightsail  requires
                   additional information to process this certificate request.
                   This can happen as a fraud-protection measure, such as when
                   the  domain  ranks  within  the Alexa top 1000 websites. To
                   provide the required information, use the AWS Support  Cen-
                   ter to contact AWS Support.

                 NOTE:
                     You  cannot request a certificate for Amazon-owned domain
                     names such  as  those  ending  in  amazonaws.com,  cloud-
                     front.net, or elasticbeanstalk.com.

                 o
                   **
                   DOMAIN_NOT_ALLOWED  ** - One or more of the domain names in
                   the certificate request was reported as an unsafe domain by
                   VirusTotal . To correct the problem, search for your domain
                   name on the VirusTotal website. If your domain is  reported
                   as suspicious, see Google Help for Hacked Websites to learn
                   what you can do. If you believe that the result is a  false
                   positive,  notify  the  organization  that is reporting the
                   domain. VirusTotal is an aggregate of several antivirus and
                   URL  scanners  and  cannot  remove your domain from a block
                   list itself. After you correct the problem and the VirusTo-
                   tal  registry  has been updated, request a new certificate.
                   If you see this error and your domain is  not  included  in
                   the  VirusTotal list, visit the AWS Support Center and cre-
                   ate a case.

                 o
                   **
                   INVALID_PUBLIC_DOMAIN ** - One or more of the domain  names
                   in the certificate request is not valid. Typically, this is
                   because a domain  name  in  the  request  is  not  a  valid
                   top-level  domain. Try to request a certificate again, cor-
                   recting any spelling errors  or  typos  that  were  in  the
                   failed  request,  and  ensure  that all domain names in the
                   request are for valid top-level domains. For  example,  you
                   cannot  request  a certificate for example.invalidpublicdo-
                   main because invalidpublicdomain is not a  valid  top-level
                   domain.

                 o
                   **
                   OTHER  **  - Typically, this failure occurs when there is a
                   typographical error in one or more of the domain  names  in
                   the  certificate  request.  Try  to  request  a certificate
                   again, correcting any spelling errors or typos that were in
                   the failed request.

              issuedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the SSL/TLS certificate was issued.

              issuer -> (string)
                 The issuer of the certificate.

              keyAlgorithm -> (string)
                 The  algorithm  used to generate the key pair (the public and
                 private key).

              notAfter -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp when the SSL/TLS certificate expires.

              notBefore -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp when the SSL/TLS certificate is first valid.

              renewalSummary -> (structure)
                 An object  that  describes  the  status  of  the  certificate
                 renewal managed by Lightsail.

                 renewalStatus -> (string)
                     The renewal status of the certificate.

                     The following renewal status are possible:

                     o
                       **
                       PendingAutoRenewal  **  -  Lightsail  is  attempting to
                       automatically validate the domain names of the certifi-
                       cate. No further action is required.

                     o
                       **
                       PendingValidation ** - Lightsail couldn't automatically
                       validate one or more domain names of  the  certificate.
                       You  must take action to validate these domain names or
                       the certificate won't be renewed. Check  to  make  sure
                       your  certificate's  domain validation records exist in
                       your domain's DNS, and that your certificate remains in
                       use.

                     o
                       **
                       Success  **  -  All domain names in the certificate are
                       validated, and Lightsail renewed  the  certificate.  No
                       further action is required.

                     o
                       **
                       Failed ** - One or more domain names were not validated
                       before the certificate expired, and Lightsail  did  not
                       renew  the  certificate. You can request a new certifi-
                       cate using the CreateCertificate action.

                 domainValidationOptions -> (list)
                     Contains information about the validation of each  domain
                     name  in  the  certificate, as it pertains to Lightsail's
                     managed renewal. This is different from the initial vali-
                     dation  that occurs as a result of the RequestCertificate
                     request.
