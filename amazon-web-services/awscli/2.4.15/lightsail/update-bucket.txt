       as versioning, public accessibility, and  the  AWS  accounts  that  can
       access the bucket.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-bucket
          --bucket-name <value>
          [--access-rules <value>]
          [--versioning <value>]
          [--readonly-access-accounts <value>]
          [--access-log-config <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket-name (string)
          The name of the bucket to update.

       --access-rules (structure)
          An object that sets the public accessibility of objects in the spec-
          ified bucket.

          getObject -> (string)
              Specifies the anonymous access to all objects in a bucket.

              The following options can be specified:

              o public - Sets all objects in the bucket to public (read-only),
                making  them readable by anyone in the world. If the getObject
                value is set to public  ,  then  all  objects  in  the  bucket
                default  to  public  regardless  of  the  allowPublicOverrides
                value.

              o private - Sets all objects in the bucket  to  private,  making
                them readable only by you or anyone you give access to. If the
                getObject value is set to private , and  the  allowPublicOver-
                rides  value  is  set to true , then all objects in the bucket
                default to private unless they  are  configured  with  a  pub-
                lic-read  ACL.  Individual  objects with a public-read ACL are
                readable by anyone in the world.

          allowPublicOverrides -> (boolean)
              A Boolean value that indicates whether the access  control  list
              (ACL)  permissions  that are applied to individual objects over-
              ride the getObject option that is currently specified.

              When this is true, you can use the PutObjectAcl  Amazon  S3  API
              action to set individual objects to public (read-only) using the
              public-read ACL, or to private using the private ACL.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          getObject=string,allowPublicOverrides=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "getObject": "public"|"private",
            "allowPublicOverrides": true|false
          }

       --versioning (string)
          Specifies whether to enable or suspend versioning of objects in  the
          bucket.

          The following options can be specified:

          o Enabled - Enables versioning of objects in the specified bucket.

          o Suspended  -  Suspends  versioning  of  objects  in  the specified
            bucket. Existing object versions are retained.

       --readonly-access-accounts (list)
          An array of strings to specify the AWS account IDs that  can  access
          the bucket.

          You can give a maximum of 10 AWS accounts access to a bucket.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --access-log-config (structure)
          An  object  that  describes  the  access  log  configuration for the
          bucket.

          enabled -> (boolean)
              A Boolean value that indicates whether bucket access logging  is
              enabled for the bucket.

          destination -> (string)
              The  name  of the bucket where the access is saved. The destina-
              tion can be a Lightsail bucket in the same account, and  in  the
              same AWS Region as the source bucket.

              NOTE:
                 This parameter is required when enabling the access log for a
                 bucket, and should be omitted when disabling the access  log.

          prefix -> (string)
              The optional object prefix for the bucket access log.

              The  prefix is an optional addition to the object key that orga-
              nizes your access log files in the destination bucket. For exam-
              ple,  if  you  specify a logs/ prefix, then each log object will
              begin  with  the  logs/  prefix  in  its   key   (for   example,
              logs/2021-11-01-21-32-16-E568B2907131C0C0 ).

              NOTE:
                 This  parameter can be optionally specified when enabling the
                 access log for a bucket, and should be omitted when disabling
                 the access log.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          enabled=boolean,destination=string,prefix=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "enabled": true|false,
            "destination": "string",
            "prefix": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       bucket -> (structure)
          An object that describes the bucket that is updated.

          resourceType -> (string)
              The  Lightsail  resource type of the bucket (for example, Bucket
              ).

          accessRules -> (structure)
              An object that describes the access rules of the bucket.

              getObject -> (string)
                 Specifies the anonymous access to all objects in a bucket.

                 The following options can be specified:

                 o public  -  Sets  all  objects  in  the  bucket  to   public
                   (read-only),  making  them readable by anyone in the world.
                   If the getObject value is set to public , then all  objects
                   in the bucket default to public regardless of the allowPub-
                   licOverrides value.

                 o private - Sets all objects in the bucket to private, making
                   them  readable only by you or anyone you give access to. If
                   the getObject value is set to private , and the allowPubli-
                   cOverrides  value  is set to true , then all objects in the
                   bucket default to private unless they are configured with a
                   public-read  ACL. Individual objects with a public-read ACL

                 list (ACL) permissions that are applied to individual objects
                 override the getObject option that is currently specified.

                 When this is true, you can use the PutObjectAcl Amazon S3 API
                 action  to set individual objects to public (read-only) using
                 the public-read ACL, or to private using the private ACL.

          arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the bucket.
