GET-INSTANCES()                                                GET-INSTANCES()



NAME
       get-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about all Amazon Lightsail virtual private servers,
       or instances .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-instances is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: instances

SYNOPSIS
            get-instances
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                              example,  specify  128  as  the fromPort (ICMPv6
                              type), and 0 as toPort (ICMPv6 code).  For  more
                              information, see Internet Control Message Proto-
                              col for IPv6 .

                        toPort -> (integer)
                            The last port in a  range  of  open  ports  on  an
                            instance.

                            Allowed ports:

                            o TCP and UDP - 0 to 65535

                            o ICMP  -  The  ICMP  code for IPv4 addresses. For
                              example, specify 8 as the fromPort (ICMP  type),
                              and -1 as the toPort (ICMP code), to enable ICMP
                              Ping. For more information, see Control Messages
                              on Wikipedia .

                            o ICMPv6  -  The ICMP code for IPv6 addresses. For
                              example, specify 128  as  the  fromPort  (ICMPv6
                              type),  and  0 as toPort (ICMPv6 code). For more

                        protocol -> (string)
                            The IP protocol name.

                            The name can be one of the following:

                            o tcp  -  Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) pro-
                              vides  reliable,  ordered,   and   error-checked
                              delivery  of  streamed data between applications
                              running on hosts communicating by an IP network.
                              If  you have an application that doesn't require
                              reliable data stream service, use UDP instead.

                            o all - All transport layer  protocol  types.  For
                              more general information, see Transport layer on
                              Wikipedia .

                            o udp - With User Datagram  Protocol  (UDP),  com-
                              puter  applications  can send messages (or data-
                              grams) to other hosts on  an  Internet  Protocol
                              (IP)   network.  Prior  communications  are  not
                              required to set up transmission channels or data
                              paths.  Applications that don't require reliable
                              data stream service can use UDP, which  provides
                              a  connectionless  datagram  service that empha-
                              sizes reduced latency over reliability.  If  you
                              do require reliable data stream service, use TCP
                              instead.

                            o icmp - Internet Control Message Protocol  (ICMP)
                              is  used  to send error messages and operational
                              information indicating success or  failure  when
                              communicating  with an instance. For example, an
                              error is indicated when an instance could not be
                              reached. When you specify icmp as the protocol ,
                              you  must  specify  the  ICMP  type  using   the
                              fromPort  parameter,  and  ICMP  code  using the
                              toPort parameter.

                        accessFrom -> (string)
                            The location from which  access  is  allowed.  For
                            example,  Anywhere  (0.0.0.0/0)  ,  or Custom if a
                            specific IP address or range of  IP  addresses  is
                            allowed.

                        accessType -> (string)
                            The type of access (Public or Private ).

                        commonName -> (string)
                            The common name of the port information.

                        accessDirection -> (string)
                            The access direction (inbound or outbound ).

                            NOTE:
                               Lightsail   currently   supports  only  inbound
                               access direction.

                        cidrs -> (list)
                            The IPv4 address, or range of IPv4  addresses  (in
                            CIDR  notation)  that are allowed to connect to an
                            instance through the ports, and the protocol.

                            NOTE:
                               The  ipv6Cidrs   parameter   lists   the   IPv6
                               addresses  that  are  allowed  to connect to an
                               instance.

                            (string)

                        ipv6Cidrs -> (list)
                            The IPv6 address, or range of IPv6  addresses  (in
                            CIDR  notation)  that are allowed to connect to an
                            instance through the ports, and the protocol. Only
                            devices  with  an  IPv6  address can connect to an
                            instance through IPv6; otherwise, IPv4  should  be
                            used.

                            NOTE:
                               The  cidrs  parameter  lists the IPv4 addresses
                               that are allowed to connect to an instance.

                            An alias that defines access for  a  preconfigured
                            range of IP addresses.

                            The  only  alias  currently  supported  is  light-
                            sail-connect , which allows IP  addresses  of  the
                            browser-based RDP/SSH client in the Lightsail con-
                            sole to connect to your instance.

                            (string)

              state -> (structure)
                 The status code and  the  state  (e.g.,  running  )  for  the
                 instance.

                 code -> (integer)
                     The status code for the instance.

                 name -> (string)
                     The state of the instance (e.g., running or pending ).

              username -> (string)
                 The  user name for connecting to the instance (e.g., ec2-user
                 ).

              sshKeyName -> (string)
                 The name of the SSH key being used to connect to the instance
                 (e.g., LightsailDefaultKeyPair ).

       nextPageToken -> (string)
          The  token to advance to the next page of results from your request.

          A next page token is not returned if there are no  more  results  to
          display.

          To  get  the  next  page  of  results,  perform another GetInstances
          request and specify the next page token using the pageToken  parame-
          ter.



                                                               GET-INSTANCES()
