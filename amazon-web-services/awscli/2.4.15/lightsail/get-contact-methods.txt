DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  the  configured contact methods. Specify a
       protocol in your request to return information about a specific contact
       method.

       A  contact  method  is used to send you notifications about your Amazon
       Lightsail resources. You can add one email address and one mobile phone
       number  contact  method in each AWS Region. However, SMS text messaging
       is not supported in some AWS Regions, and SMS text messages  cannot  be
       sent to some countries/regions. For more information, see Notifications
       in Amazon Lightsail .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-contact-methods
          [--protocols <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --protocols (list)
          The protocols used to send notifications, such as  Email  ,  or  SMS
          (text messaging).

          Specify  a  protocol  in  your request to return information about a
          specific contact method protocol.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            Email
            SMS

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
