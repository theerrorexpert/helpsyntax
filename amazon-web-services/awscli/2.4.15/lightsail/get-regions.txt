NAME
       get-regions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of  all  valid  regions for Amazon Lightsail. Use the
       include availability zones parameter to also  return  the  Availability
       Zones in a region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-regions
          [--include-availability-zones | --no-include-availability-zones]
          [--include-relational-database-availability-zones | --no-include-relational-database-availability-zones]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --include-availability-zones      |     --no-include-availability-zones
       (boolean)
          A Boolean value indicating  whether  to  also  include  Availability
          Zones  in your get regions request. Availability Zones are indicated
          with a letter: e.g., us-east-2a .

       --include-relational-database-availability-zones  |  --no-include-rela-
       tional-database-availability-zones (boolean)
          A  Boolean  value  indicating  whether  to also include Availability
          Zones for databases in your get regions request. Availability  Zones
          are indicated with a letter (e.g., us-east-2a ).

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
