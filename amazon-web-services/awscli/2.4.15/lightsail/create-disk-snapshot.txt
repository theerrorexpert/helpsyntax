CREATE-DISK-SNAPSHOT()                                  CREATE-DISK-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       create-disk-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  snapshot of a block storage disk. You can use snapshots for
       backups, to make copies of disks, and to save data before shutting down
       a Lightsail instance.

       You  can  take  a snapshot of an attached disk that is in use; however,
       snapshots only capture data that has been written to your disk  at  the
       time the snapshot command is issued. This may exclude any data that has
       been cached by any applications or the operating  system.  If  you  can
       pause any file systems on the disk long enough to take a snapshot, your
       snapshot should be complete. Nevertheless, if you cannot pause all file
       writes  to the disk, you should unmount the disk from within the Light-
       sail instance, issue the create disk snapshot command, and then remount
       the  disk to ensure a consistent and complete snapshot. You may remount
       and use your disk while the snapshot status is pending.

       You can also use this operation to create a snapshot of  an  instance's
       system  volume. You might want to do this, for example, to recover data
       from the system volume of a botched instance or to create a  backup  of
       the  system volume like you would for a block storage disk. To create a
       snapshot of a system volume, just define the  instance  name  parameter
       when  issuing  the  snapshot  command,  and  a  snapshot of the defined
       instance's system volume will be created. After the snapshot is  avail-
       able,  you can create a block storage disk from the snapshot and attach
       it to a running instance to access the data on the disk.

       The create disk snapshot operation supports  tag-based  access  control
       via request tags. For more information, see the Amazon Lightsail Devel-
       oper Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            create-disk-snapshot
          [--disk-name <value>]
          --disk-snapshot-name <value>
          [--instance-name <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --disk-name (string)
          The unique name of the source disk (e.g., Disk-Virginia-1 ).

          NOTE:
              This parameter cannot be defined together with the instance name
              parameter.  The disk name and instance name parameters are mutu-
              ally exclusive.

       --disk-snapshot-name (string)
          The name of the destination disk snapshot (e.g., my-disk-snapshot  )
          based on the source disk.

       --instance-name (string)
          The    unique    name   of   the   source   instance   (e.g.,   Ama-
          zon_Linux-512MB-Virginia-1 ). When this is defined,  a  snapshot  of
          the instance's system volume is created.

          NOTE:
              This  parameter  cannot  be  defined together with the disk name
              parameter. The instance name and disk name parameters are  mutu-
              ally exclusive.

       --tags (list)
          The  tag keys and optional values to add to the resource during cre-
          ate.

          Use the TagResource action to tag a resource after it's created.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag key and optional value  assigned  to  an  Amazon
              Lightsail resource.

              For  more  information  about  tags in Lightsail, see the Amazon
              Lightsail Developer Guide .

              key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

                 Constraints: Tag keys accept a maximum of 128  letters,  num-
                 bers, spaces in UTF-8, or the following characters: + - = . _
                 : / @

              value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

                 Constraints: Tag values accept a maximum of 256 letters, num-
                 bers, spaces in UTF-8, or the following characters: + - = . _
                 : / @

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
