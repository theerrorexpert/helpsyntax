GET-CONTAINER-LOG()                                        GET-CONTAINER-LOG()



NAME
       get-container-log -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  log  events  of a container of your Amazon Lightsail con-
       tainer service.

       If your container service has more than one node (i.e., a scale greater
       than  1),  then the log events that are returned for the specified con-
       tainer are merged from all nodes on your container service.

       NOTE:
          Container logs are retained for a certain amount of time.  For  more
          information,  see  Amazon  Lightsail endpoints and quotas in the AWS
          General Reference .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-container-log
          --service-name <value>
          --container-name <value>
          [--start-time <value>]
          [--end-time <value>]
          [--filter-pattern <value>]
          [--page-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --service-name (string)
          The name of the container service for which to get a container  log.

       --container-name (string)
          The  name  of the container that is either running or previously ran
          on the container service for which to return a log.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The start of the time interval for which to get log data.

          Constraints:

          o Specified in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          o Specified in the Unix time format. For example, if you wish to use
            a  start  time of October 1, 2018, at 8 PM UTC, specify 1538424000
            as the start time.

          You can convert a human-friendly time to Unix time  format  using  a
          converter like Epoch converter .

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end of the time interval for which to get log data.

          Constraints:

          o Specified in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

          o Specified in the Unix time format. For example, if you wish to use
            an end time of October 1, 2018, at 9 PM UTC, specify 1538427600 as
            the end time.

          You  can  convert  a human-friendly time to Unix time format using a
          converter like Epoch converter .

       --filter-pattern (string)
          The pattern to use to filter the returned log events to  a  specific
          term.

          The  following  are  a  few examples of filter patterns that you can
          specify:

          o To return all log events, specify a filter pattern of "" .

          o To exclude log events that contain the ERROR term, and return  all
            other log events, specify a filter pattern of "-ERROR" .

          o To return log events that contain the ERROR term, specify a filter
            pattern of "ERROR" .

          o To return log events that contain both  the  ERROR  and  Exception
            terms, specify a filter pattern of "ERROR Exception" .

          o To  return  log  events  that  contain the ERROR  or the Exception
            term, specify a filter pattern of "?ERROR ?Exception" .

       --page-token (string)
          The token to advance to the next page of results from your  request.

          To  get a page token, perform an initial GetContainerLog request. If
          your results are paginated, the response will  return  a  next  page
          token  that  you  can  specify  as  the  page  token in a subsequent
          request.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       logEvents -> (list)
          An array of objects that describe the log events of a container.

          (structure)
              Describes the log events of a container of an  Amazon  Lightsail
              container service.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  timestamp  when the container service log event was cre-
                 ated.

              message -> (string)
                 The message of the container service log event.

       nextPageToken -> (string)
          The token to advance to the next page of results from your  request.

          A  next  page  token is not returned if there are no more results to
          display.

          To get the next page of  results,  perform  another  GetContainerLog
          request  and specify the next page token using the pageToken parame-
          ter.
