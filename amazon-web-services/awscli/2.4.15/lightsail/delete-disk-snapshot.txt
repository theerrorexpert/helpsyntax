DELETE-DISK-SNAPSHOT()                                  DELETE-DISK-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       delete-disk-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the specified disk snapshot.

       When you make periodic snapshots of a disk, the snapshots are incremen-
       tal, and only the blocks on the device that  have  changed  since  your
       last  snapshot  are  saved in the new snapshot. When you delete a snap-
       shot, only the data not needed for any other snapshot  is  removed.  So
       regardless of which prior snapshots have been deleted, all active snap-
       shots will have access to all the information  needed  to  restore  the
       disk.

       The  delete  disk  snapshot operation supports tag-based access control
       via resource tags applied to the resource identified by  disk  snapshot
       name . For more information, see the Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-disk-snapshot
          --disk-snapshot-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --disk-snapshot-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  disk  snapshot  you  want   to   delete   (e.g.,
          my-disk-snapshot ).

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a snapshot of a block storage disk

       The  following delete-disk-snapshot example deletes the specified snap-
       shot of a block storage disk

          aws lightsail delete-disk-snapshot \
              --disk-snapshot-name DiskSnapshot-1

       Output:
