EXPORT-SNAPSHOT()                                            EXPORT-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       export-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Exports  an Amazon Lightsail instance or block storage disk snapshot to
       Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2). This operation results in an
       export snapshot record that can be used with the create cloud formation
       stack operation to create new Amazon EC2 instances.

       Exported instance snapshots appear in  Amazon  EC2  as  Amazon  Machine
       Images  (AMIs), and the instance system disk appears as an Amazon Elas-
       tic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Exported disk snapshots appear  in
       Amazon  EC2  as  Amazon EBS volumes. Snapshots are exported to the same
       Amazon Web Services Region in Amazon EC2 as the source Lightsail  snap-
       shot.

       The  export  snapshot  operation  supports tag-based access control via
       resource tags applied to the resource  identified  by  source  snapshot
       name . For more information, see the Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide .

       NOTE:
          Use the get instance snapshots or get disk snapshots  operations  to
          get a list of snapshots that you can export to Amazon EC2.

SYNOPSIS
            export-snapshot
          --source-snapshot-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-snapshot-name (string)
          The  name  of the instance or disk snapshot to be exported to Amazon
          EC2.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
