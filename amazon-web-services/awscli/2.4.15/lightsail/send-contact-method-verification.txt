SEND-CONTACT-METHOD-VERIFICATION()          SEND-CONTACT-METHOD-VERIFICATION()



NAME
       send-contact-method-verification -

DESCRIPTION
       Sends  a verification request to an email contact method to ensure it's
       owned by the requester. SMS contact methods don't need to be  verified.

       A  contact  method  is used to send you notifications about your Amazon
       Lightsail resources. You can add one email address and one mobile phone
       number  contact  method in each AWS Region. However, SMS text messaging
       is not supported in some AWS Regions, and SMS text messages  cannot  be
       sent to some countries/regions. For more information, see Notifications
       in Amazon Lightsail .

       A verification request is sent to the contact method when you initially
       create  it.  Use  this action to send another verification request if a
       previous verification request was deleted, or has expired.

       WARNING:
          Notifications are not sent to an email contact method until after it
          is verified, and confirmed as valid.

SYNOPSIS
            send-contact-method-verification
          --protocol <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --protocol (string)
          The protocol to verify, such as Email or SMS (text messaging).

          Possible values:

          o Email

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
