DETACH-DISK()                                                    DETACH-DISK()



NAME
       detach-disk -

DESCRIPTION
       Detaches  a  stopped block storage disk from a Lightsail instance. Make
       sure to unmount any file systems on the device  within  your  operating
       system before stopping the instance and detaching the disk.

       The  detach  disk  operation  supports  tag-based  access  control  via
       resource tags applied to the resource identified by  disk  name  .  For
       more information, see the Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            detach-disk
          --disk-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --disk-name (string)
          The  unique  name  of the disk you want to detach from your instance
          (e.g., my-disk ).

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
