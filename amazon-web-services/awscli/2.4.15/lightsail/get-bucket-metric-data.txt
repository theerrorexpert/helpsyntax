GET-BUCKET-METRIC-DATA()                              GET-BUCKET-METRIC-DATA()



NAME
       get-bucket-metric-data -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  data  points of a specific metric for an Amazon Lightsail
       bucket.

       Metrics report the utilization of a bucket.  View  and  collect  metric
       data  regularly  to  monitor  the  number of objects stored in a bucket
       (including object  versions)  and  the  storage  space  used  by  those
       objects.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket-metric-data
          --bucket-name <value>
          --metric-name <value>
          --start-time <value>
          --end-time <value>
          --period <value>
          --statistics <value>
          --unit <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket-name (string)
          The name of the bucket for which to get metric data.

       --metric-name (string)
          The metric for which you want to return information.

          Valid bucket metric names are listed below, along with the most use-
          ful statistics to include in your request, and  the  published  unit
          value.

          NOTE:
              These bucket metrics are reported once per day.

          o
            **
            BucketSizeBytes  **  -  The  amount  of  data in bytes stored in a
            bucket. This value is  calculated  by  summing  the  size  of  all
            objects  in  the bucket (including object versions), including the
            size of all parts for all  incomplete  multipart  uploads  to  the
            bucket.  Statistics:  The most useful statistic is Maximum . Unit:
            The published unit is Bytes .

          o
            **
            NumberOfObjects ** - The total  number  of  objects  stored  in  a
            bucket.  This  value  is calculated by counting all objects in the
            bucket (including object versions) and the total number  of  parts
            for  all  incomplete  multipart uploads to the bucket. Statistics:
            The most useful statistic is Average . Unit: The published unit is
            Count .

          Possible values:

          o BucketSizeBytes

          o NumberOfObjects

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The timestamp indicating the earliest data to be returned.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The timestamp indicating the latest data to be returned.

       --period (integer)
          The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points.

          NOTE:
              Bucket storage metrics are reported once per day. Therefore, you
              should specify a period of 86400 seconds, which is the number of
              seconds in a day.

       --statistics (list)
          The statistic for the metric.

          The following statistics are available:

          o Minimum  -  The lowest value observed during the specified period.
            Use this value to determine  low  volumes  of  activity  for  your
            application.

          o Maximum  - The highest value observed during the specified period.
            Use this value to determine high  volumes  of  activity  for  your
            application.

          o Sum - The sum of all values submitted for the matching metric. You
            can use this statistic to determine the total volume of a  metric.

          o Average  -  The  value  of  Sum / SampleCount during the specified
            period. By comparing this statistic with the Minimum  and  Maximum
            values, you can determine the full scope of a metric and how close
            the average use is to the Minimum and Maximum values. This compar-
            ison  helps  you  to  know  when  to  increase  or  decrease  your
            resources.

          o SampleCount - The count, or number, of data points  used  for  the
            statistical calculation.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            Minimum
            Maximum
            Sum
            Average
            SampleCount

       --unit (string)
          The unit for the metric data request.

          Valid units depend on the metric data being requested. For the valid
          units with each available metric, see the metricName parameter.

          Possible values:

          o Seconds

          o Microseconds

          o Milliseconds

          o Bytes

          o None

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
