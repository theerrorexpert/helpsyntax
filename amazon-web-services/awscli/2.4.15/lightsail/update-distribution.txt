OPTIONS
       --distribution-name (string)
          The name of the distribution to update.

          Use  the GetDistributions action to get a list of distribution names
          that you can specify.

       --origin (structure)
          An object that describes the origin resource for  the  distribution,
          such as a Lightsail instance or load balancer.

          The  distribution pulls, caches, and serves content from the origin.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the origin resource.

          regionName -> (string)
              The AWS Region name of the origin resource.

          protocolPolicy -> (string)
              The protocol that your Amazon Lightsail distribution  uses  when
              establishing a connection with your origin to pull content.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,regionName=string,protocolPolicy=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "name": "string",
            "regionName": "us-east-1"|"us-east-2"|"us-west-1"|"us-west-2"|"eu-west-1"|"eu-west-2"|"eu-west-3"|"eu-central-1"|"ca-central-1"|"ap-south-1"|"ap-southeast-1"|"ap-southeast-2"|"ap-northeast-1"|"ap-northeast-2"|"eu-north-1",
            "protocolPolicy": "http-only"|"https-only"
          }

       --default-cache-behavior (structure)
          An  object that describes the default cache behavior for the distri-
          bution.

          behavior -> (string)
              The cache behavior of the distribution.

              The following cache behaviors can be specified:

              o
                **
                cache ** - This option is best for static sites.  When  speci-
                fied,  your distribution caches and serves your entire website
                as static content. This behavior is ideal  for  websites  with
                static  content that doesn't change depending on who views it,
                or for websites that don't  use  cookies,  headers,  or  query
                strings to personalize content.

              o
                **
                dont-cache ** - This option is best for sites that serve a mix
                of static and dynamic content. When specified, your  distribu-
                tion  caches  and  serve only the content that is specified in
                the distribution's CacheBehaviorPerPath parameter. This behav-
                ior  is  ideal for websites or web applications that use cook-
                ies, headers, and query strings  to  personalize  content  for
                individual users.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          behavior=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "behavior": "dont-cache"|"cache"
          }

       --cache-behavior-settings (structure)
          An object that describes the cache behavior settings for the distri-
          bution.

          NOTE:
              The cacheBehaviorSettings specified in your  UpdateDistribution-
              Request will replace your distribution's existing settings.

          defaultTTL -> (long)
              The  default  amount  of time that objects stay in the distribu-
              tion's cache before the distribution forwards another request to
              the origin to determine whether the content has been updated.

              NOTE:
                 The value specified applies only when the origin does not add
                 HTTP headers such as Cache-Control  max-age  ,  Cache-Control
                 s-maxage , and Expires to objects.

          minimumTTL -> (long)
              The  minimum  amount  of time that objects stay in the distribu-
              tion's cache before the distribution forwards another request to
              the origin to determine whether the object has been updated.

              A  value  of 0 must be specified for minimumTTL if the distribu-
              tion is configured to forward all headers to the origin.

          maximumTTL -> (long)
              The maximum amount of time that objects stay  in  the  distribu-
              tion's cache before the distribution forwards another request to
              the origin to determine whether the object has been updated.

              The value specified applies only when the origin adds HTTP head-
              ers such as Cache-Control max-age , Cache-Control s-maxage , and
              Expires to objects.

          allowedHTTPMethods -> (string)
              The HTTP methods that are processed and forwarded to the distri-
              bution's origin.

              You can specify the following options:

              o GET,HEAD - The distribution forwards the GET and HEAD methods.

              o GET,HEAD,OPTIONS - The distribution forwards the GET , HEAD  ,
                and OPTIONS methods.

              o GET,HEAD,OPTIONS,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE - The distribution for-
                wards the GET , HEAD , OPTIONS , PUT ,  PATCH  ,  POST  ,  and
                DELETE methods.

              If  you  specify  the  third  option, you might need to restrict
              access to your distribution's  origin  so  users  can't  perform
              operations  that  you don't want them to. For example, you might
              not want users to have permission to delete  objects  from  your
              origin.

          cachedHTTPMethods -> (string)
              The  HTTP method responses that are cached by your distribution.

              You can specify the following options:

              o GET,HEAD - The distribution caches responses to  the  GET  and
                HEAD methods.

              o GET,HEAD,OPTIONS  -  The  distribution caches responses to the
                GET , HEAD , and OPTIONS methods.

          forwardedCookies -> (structure)
              An object that describes the cookies that are forwarded  to  the
              origin.  Your  content  is  cached based on the cookies that are
              forwarded.

              option -> (string)
                 Specifies which cookies to forward to the distribution's ori-
                 gin  for a cache behavior: all , none , or allow-list to for-
                 ward only  the  cookies  specified  in  the  cookiesAllowList
                 parameter.

              cookiesAllowList -> (list)
                 The  specific  cookies to forward to your distribution's ori-
                 gin.

                 (string)

          forwardedHeaders -> (structure)
              An object that describes the headers that are forwarded  to  the
              origin.  Your  content  is  cached based on the headers that are
              forwarded.

              option -> (string)
                 The headers that you want your  distribution  to  forward  to
                 your origin and base caching on.

                 You  can configure your distribution to do one of the follow-
                 ing:

                 o
                   **
                   all ** - Forward all headers to your origin.

                 o
                   **
                   none ** - Forward only the default headers.

                 o
                   **
                   allow-list ** - Forward only the headers you specify  using
                   the headersAllowList parameter.

              headersAllowList -> (list)
                 The  specific  headers to forward to your distribution's ori-
                 gin.

                 (string)

          forwardedQueryStrings -> (structure)
              An object that describes the query strings that are forwarded to
              the  origin.  Your  content is cached based on the query strings
              that are forwarded.

              option -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the distribution forwards and caches  based
                 on query strings.

              queryStringsAllowList -> (list)
                 The  specific query strings that the distribution forwards to
                 the origin.

                 Your distribution will cache content based on  the  specified
                 query strings.

                 If  the option parameter is true, then your distribution for-
                 wards all query strings, regardless of what you specify using
                 the queryStringsAllowList parameter.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "defaultTTL": long,

       --cache-behaviors (list)
          An  array  of  objects that describe the per-path cache behavior for
          the distribution.

          (structure)
              Describes the per-path cache behavior  of  an  Amazon  Lightsail
              content delivery network (CDN) distribution.

              A  per-path cache behavior is used to override, or add an excep-
              tion to, the default cache behavior of a distribution. For exam-
              ple,  if  the  cacheBehavior  is  set to cache , then a per-path
              cache behavior can be used to specify a directory, file, or file
              type that your distribution will cache. Alternately, if the dis-
              tribution's cacheBehavior is dont-cache , then a per-path  cache
              behavior  can be used to specify a directory, file, or file type
              that your distribution will not cache.

              if the cacheBehavior's behavior is set to 'cache', then

              path -> (string)
                 The path to a directory or file to cached, or not cache.  Use
                 an   asterisk   symbol   to   specify   wildcard  directories
                 (path/to/assets/* ), and file types  (*.html,  *jpg,  *js  ).
                 Directories and file paths are case-sensitive.

                 Examples:

                 o Specify  the  following  to cache all files in the document
                   root of  an  Apache  web  server  running  on  a  Lightsail
                   instance.  var/www/html/

                 o Specify  the following file to cache only the index page in
                   the   document   root   of   an    Apache    web    server.
                   var/www/html/index.html

                 o Specify  the following to cache only the .html files in the
                   document root of an Apache web server.  var/www/html/*.html

                 o Specify  the  following  to  cache only the .jpg, .png, and
                   .gif files in the images sub-directory of the document root
                   of   an   Apache   web  server.   var/www/html/images/*.jpg
                   var/www/html/images/*.png         var/www/html/images/*.gif
                   Specify  the  following  to  cache  all files in the images
                   sub-directory of the document root of an Apache web server.
                   var/www/html/images/

              behavior -> (string)
                 The cache behavior for the specified path.

                 You  can  specify  one of the following per-path cache behav-
                 iors:

                 o
                   **
                   cache ** - This behavior caches the specified path.

                 o
                   **
                   dont-cache ** - This behavior doesn't cache  the  specified
                   path.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          path=string,behavior=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "path": "string",
              "behavior": "dont-cache"|"cache"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --is-enabled | --no-is-enabled (boolean)
          Indicates whether to enable the distribution.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
