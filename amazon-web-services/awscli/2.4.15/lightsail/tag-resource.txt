NAME
       tag-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  one or more tags to the specified Amazon Lightsail resource. Each
       resource can have a maximum of 50 tags. Each tag consists of a key  and
       an  optional  value.  Tag  keys  must  be unique per resource. For more
       information about tags, see the Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide .

       The tag  resource  operation  supports  tag-based  access  control  via
       request  tags  and  resource tags applied to the resource identified by
       resource name . For more information, see the Amazon  Lightsail  Devel-
       oper Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            tag-resource
          --resource-name <value>
          [--resource-arn <value>]
          --tags <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-name (string)
          The name of the resource to which you are adding tags.

       --resource-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource to which you want to
          add a tag.

       --tags (list)
          The tag key and optional value.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag key and optional value  assigned  to  an  Amazon
              Lightsail resource.

              For  more  information  about  tags in Lightsail, see the Amazon
              Lightsail Developer Guide .

              key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

                 Constraints: Tag keys accept a maximum of 128  letters,  num-
                 bers, spaces in UTF-8, or the following characters: + - = . _
                 : / @

              value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

                 Constraints: Tag values accept a maximum of 256 letters, num-
                 bers, spaces in UTF-8, or the following characters: + - = . _
                 : / @

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
