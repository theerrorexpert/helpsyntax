UPDATE-CONTAINER-SERVICE()                          UPDATE-CONTAINER-SERVICE()



NAME
       update-container-service -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the  configuration of your Amazon Lightsail container service,
       such as its power, scale, and public domain names.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-container-service
          --service-name <value>
          [--power <value>]
          [--scale <value>]
          [--is-disabled | --no-is-disabled]
          [--public-domain-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --service-name (string)
          The name of the container service to update.

       --power (string)
          The power for the container service.

          The power specifies the amount of memory, vCPUs,  and  base  monthly
          cost of each node of the container service. The power and scale of a
          container service makes up its configured capacity. To determine the
          monthly  price of your container service, multiply the base price of
          the power with the scale (the number of nodes) of the service.

          Use the GetContainerServicePowers action to view the  specifications
          of each power option.

          Possible values:

          o nano

          o micro

          o small

          o medium

          o large

          o xlarge

       --scale (integer)
          The scale for the container service.

          The  scale  specifies  the  allocated compute nodes of the container
          service. The power and scale of a container  service  makes  up  its
          configured  capacity.  To  determine  the monthly price of your con-
          tainer service, multiply the base price of the power with the  scale
          (the number of nodes) of the service.

       --is-disabled | --no-is-disabled (boolean)
          A  Boolean  value  to indicate whether the container service is dis-
          abled.

       --public-domain-names (map)
          The public domain names to use with the container service,  such  as
          example.com and www.example.com .

          You  can specify up to four public domain names for a container ser-
          vice. The domain names that you specify are used when you  create  a
          deployment  with  a  container  configured as the public endpoint of
          your container service.

          If you don't specify public domain  names,  then  you  can  use  the
          default domain of the container service.

          WARNING:
              You  must  create and validate an SSL/TLS certificate before you
              can use public domain names with your container service. Use the
              CreateCertificate  action to create a certificate for the public
              domain names you want to use with your container service.

          You can specify public domain names using a string to array  map  as
          shown in the example later on this page.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,string,KeyName2=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": ["string", ...]
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                   a time.

                 o Inactive  - The deployment was previously successfully cre-
                   ated, but it is not currently running on the container ser-
                   vice.

                 o Failed  -  The  deployment  failed. Use the GetContainerLog
                   action to view the log events for  the  containers  in  the
                   deployment  to try to determine the reason for the failure.

                        Container images sourced from your Lightsail container
                        service, that are registered and stored on  your  ser-
                        vice,  start  with  a colon (: ). For example, if your
                        container service name is  container-service-1  ,  the
                        container  image  label is mystaticsite , and you want
                        to use the third (3 ) version of the  registered  con-
                        tainer  image, then you should specify :container-ser-
                        vice-1.mystaticsite.3 . To use the latest version of a
                        container  image,  specify latest instead of a version
                        number  (for  example,  :container-service-1.mystatic-
                        site.latest  ).  Lightsail  will automatically use the
                        highest numbered version of the  registered  container
                        image.

                        Container  images  sourced from a public registry like
                        Docker Hub don't start  with  a  colon.  For  example,
                        nginx:latest or nginx .

                        service,  that  are registered and stored on your ser-
                        vice, start with a colon (: ). For  example,  if  your
                        container  service  name  is container-service-1 , the
                        container image label is mystaticsite , and  you  want
                        to  use  the third (3 ) version of the registered con-
                        tainer image, then you should specify  :container-ser-
                        vice-1.mystaticsite.3 . To use the latest version of a
                        container image, specify latest instead of  a  version
                        number  (for  example,  :container-service-1.mystatic-
                        site.latest ). Lightsail will  automatically  use  the
                        highest  numbered  version of the registered container
                        image.

                        Container images sourced from a public  registry  like
                        Docker  Hub  don't  start  with  a colon. For example,
                        nginx:latest or nginx .

                     unhealthyThreshold -> (integer)
                        The   number  of  consecutive  health  check  failures
                        required before moving the container to the  Unhealthy
                        state. The default value is 2 .

                     timeoutSeconds -> (integer)
                        The  amount  of  time,  in  seconds,  during  which no

          principalArn -> (string)
              The principal ARN of the container service.

              The  principal  ARN  can  be used to create a trust relationship
              between your standard AWS account and your  Lightsail  container
              service.  This  allows  you  to  give your service permission to
              access resources in your standard AWS account.

          privateDomainName -> (string)
              The private domain name of the container service.

              The private domain name is accessible only  by  other  resources
              within the default virtual private cloud (VPC) of your Lightsail
              account.

          publicDomainNames -> (map)
              The public domain name of the container service, such  as  exam-
              ple.com and www.example.com .

              You  can  specify up to four public domain names for a container
              service. The domain names that you specify  are  used  when  you
              create  a  deployment  with a container configured as the public
              endpoint of your container service.

              If you don't specify public domain names, then you can  use  the
              default domain of the container service.

              WARNING:
                 You  must  create  and validate an SSL/TLS certificate before
                 you can use public domain names with your container  service.
                 Use  the CreateCertificate action to create a certificate for
                 the public domain names you want to use with  your  container
                 service.

              See  CreateContainerService or UpdateContainerService for infor-
              mation about how to specify public domain names for your  Light-
              sail container service.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (list)
                 (string)

          url -> (string)
              The publicly accessible URL of the container service.

              If  no  public  endpoint is specified in the currentDeployment ,
              this URL returns a 404 response.
