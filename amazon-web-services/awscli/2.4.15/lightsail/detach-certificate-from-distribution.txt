DETACH-CERTIFICATE-FROM-DISTRIBUTION()  DETACH-CERTIFICATE-FROM-DISTRIBUTION()



NAME
       detach-certificate-from-distribution -

DESCRIPTION
       Detaches  an  SSL/TLS  certificate  from  your Amazon Lightsail content
       delivery network (CDN) distribution.

       After the certificate is detached, your  distribution  stops  accepting
       traffic  for  all  of the domains that are associated with the certifi-
       cate.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            detach-certificate-from-distribution
          --distribution-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --distribution-name (string)
          The name of the distribution from which to detach the certificate.

          Use the GetDistributions action to get a list of distribution  names
          that you can specify.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
