DELETE-DISK()                                                    DELETE-DISK()



NAME
       delete-disk -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the  specified  block  storage  disk.  The disk must be in the
       available state (not attached to a Lightsail instance).

       NOTE:
          The disk may remain in the deleting state for several minutes.

       The  delete  disk  operation  supports  tag-based  access  control  via
       resource  tags  applied  to  the resource identified by disk name . For
       more information, see the Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-disk
          --disk-name <value>
          [--force-delete-add-ons | --no-force-delete-add-ons]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --disk-name (string)
          The unique name of the disk you want to delete (e.g., my-disk ).

       --force-delete-add-ons | --no-force-delete-add-ons (boolean)
          A Boolean value to indicate whether to delete  the  enabled  add-ons
          for the disk.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
