CREATE-DOMAIN()                                                CREATE-DOMAIN()



NAME
       create-domain -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a domain resource for the specified domain (e.g., example.com).

       The create domain  operation  supports  tag-based  access  control  via
       request  tags. For more information, see the Amazon Lightsail Developer
       Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-domain
          --domain-name <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The domain name to manage (e.g., example.com ).

          NOTE:
              You cannot register a new domain name using Lightsail. You  must
              register  a  domain name using Amazon Route 53 or another domain
              name registrar. If you have already registered your domain,  you
              can  enter  its name in this parameter to manage the DNS records
              for that domain using Lightsail.

       --tags (list)
          The tag keys and optional values to add to the resource during  cre-
          ate.

          Use the TagResource action to tag a resource after it's created.

          (structure)
              Describes  a  tag  key  and optional value assigned to an Amazon
              Lightsail resource.

              For more information about tags in  Lightsail,  see  the  Amazon
              Lightsail Developer Guide .

              key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

                 Constraints:  Tag  keys accept a maximum of 128 letters, num-
                 bers, spaces in UTF-8, or the following characters: + - = . _
                 : / @

              value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

                 Constraints: Tag values accept a maximum of 256 letters, num-
                 bers, spaces in UTF-8, or the following characters: + - = . _
                 : / @

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a domain (DNS zone)

       The  following  create-domain example creates a DNS zone for the speci-
       fied domain.

       Note: Lightsail's domain-related API operations are available  in  only
       the  us-east-1  Region. If your CLI profile is configured to use a dif-
       ferent Region, you must include the --region us-east-1 parameter or the
       command fails.

          aws lightsail create-domain \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --domain-name example.com

       Output:

          {
              "operation": {
                  "id": "64e522c8-9ae1-4c05-9b65-3f237324dc34",
                  "resourceName": "example.com",
                  "resourceType": "Domain",
                  "createdAt": 1569864291.92,
                  "location": {
                      "availabilityZone": "all",
                      "regionName": "global"
                  },
                  "isTerminal": true,
                  "operationType": "CreateDomain",
                  "status": "Succeeded",
                  "statusChangedAt": 1569864292.109
              }
          }
