NAME
       get-container-service-metric-data -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  data points of a specific metric of your Amazon Lightsail
       container service.

       Metrics report the utilization of your resources. Monitor  and  collect
       metric  data  regularly  to maintain the reliability, availability, and
       performance of your resources.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-container-service-metric-data
          --service-name <value>
          --metric-name <value>
          --start-time <value>
          --end-time <value>
          --period <value>
          --statistics <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --service-name (string)
          The name of the container service for which to get metric data.

       --metric-name (string)
          The metric for which you want to return information.

          Valid container service metric names are listed  below,  along  with
          the  most useful statistics to include in your request, and the pub-
          lished unit value.

          o CPUUtilization - The average percentage of compute units that  are
            currently  in  use across all nodes of the container service. This
            metric identifies the processing power required to run  containers
            on each node of the container service. Statistics: The most useful
            statistics are Maximum and Average . Unit: The published  unit  is
            Percent .

          o MemoryUtilization  -  The  average  percentage of available memory
            that is currently in use across all nodes of  the  container  ser-
            vice. This metric identifies the memory required to run containers
            on each node of the container service. Statistics: The most useful
            statistics  are  Maximum and Average . Unit: The published unit is
            Percent .

          Possible values:

          o CPUUtilization

          o MemoryUtilization

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The start time of the time period.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end time of the time period.

       --period (integer)
          The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points.

          All container service metric data is available in 5-minute (300 sec-
          onds) granularity.

       --statistics (list)
          The statistic for the metric.

          The following statistics are available:

          o Minimum  -  The lowest value observed during the specified period.
            Use this value to determine  low  volumes  of  activity  for  your
            application.

          o Maximum  - The highest value observed during the specified period.
            Use this value to determine high  volumes  of  activity  for  your
            application.

          o Sum - All values submitted for the matching metric added together.
            You can use this statistic to determine the total volume of a met-
            ric.

          o Average  -  The  value  of  Sum / SampleCount during the specified
            period. By comparing this statistic with the Minimum  and  Maximum
            values, you can determine the full scope of a metric and how close
            the average use is to the Minimum and Maximum values. This compar-
            ison  helps  you  to  know  when  to  increase  or  decrease  your
            resources.

          o SampleCount - The count, or number, of data points  used  for  the
            statistical calculation.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            Minimum
            Maximum
            Sum
            Average
            SampleCount

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
