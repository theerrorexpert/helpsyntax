NAME
       get-certificates -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about one or more Amazon Lightsail SSL/TLS certifi-
       cates.

       NOTE:
          To get a summary of a certificate,  ommit  includeCertificateDetails
          from  your  request.  The response will include only the certificate
          Amazon Resource Name (ARN), certificate name, domain name, and tags.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-certificates
          [--certificate-statuses <value>]
          [--include-certificate-details | --no-include-certificate-details]
          [--certificate-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-statuses (list)
          The status of the certificates for which to return information.

          For  example,  specify  ISSUED  to  return only certificates with an
          ISSUED status.

          When omitted, the response includes all of your certificates in  the
          AWS  Region  where  the request is made, regardless of their current
          status.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            PENDING_VALIDATION
            ISSUED
            INACTIVE
            EXPIRED
            VALIDATION_TIMED_OUT
            REVOKED
            FAILED

       --include-certificate-details    |     --no-include-certificate-details
       (boolean)
          Indicates whether to include detailed information about the certifi-
          cates in the response.

          When omitted, the response includes only the certificate names, Ama-
          zon Resource Names (ARNs), domain names, and tags.

       --certificate-name (string)
          The name for the certificate for which to return information.

          When  omitted, the response includes all of your certificates in the
          AWS Region where the request is made.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     The following failure reasons are possible:

                     o
                       **
                       NO_AVAILABLE_CONTACTS  **  -  This  failure  applies to
                       email validation, which is not available for  Lightsail
                       certificates.

                     o
                       **
                       ADDITIONAL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED    **    -   Lightsail
                       requires additional information to  process  this  cer-
                       tificate request. This can happen as a fraud-protection
                       measure, such as when the domain ranks within the Alexa
                       top 1000 websites. To provide the required information,
                       use the AWS Support Center to contact AWS Support.

                     NOTE:
                        You cannot  request  a  certificate  for  Amazon-owned
                        domain  names  such  as those ending in amazonaws.com,
                        cloudfront.net, or elasticbeanstalk.com.

                     o
                       **
                       DOMAIN_NOT_ALLOWED ** - One or more of the domain names
                       in  the  certificate  request was reported as an unsafe
                       domain by VirusTotal . To correct the  problem,  search
                       for your domain name on the VirusTotal website. If your
                       domain is reported as suspicious, see Google  Help  for
                       Hacked  Websites  to  learn  what  you  can  do. If you
                       believe that the result is a false positive, notify the
                       organization  that  is reporting the domain. VirusTotal
                       is an aggregate of several antivirus and  URL  scanners
                       and cannot remove your domain from a block list itself.
                       After you correct the problem and the  VirusTotal  reg-
                       istry  has  been updated, request a new certificate. If
                       you see this error and your domain is not  included  in
                       the  VirusTotal  list, visit the AWS Support Center and
                       create a case.

                     o
                       **
                       INVALID_PUBLIC_DOMAIN ** - One or more  of  the  domain
                       names  in  the  certificate request is not valid. Typi-
                       cally, this is because a domain name in the request  is
                       not a valid top-level domain. Try to request a certifi-
                       cate again, correcting any  spelling  errors  or  typos
                       that  were  in  the failed request, and ensure that all
                       domain names in the request  are  for  valid  top-level
                       domains.  For example, you cannot request a certificate
                       for example.invalidpublicdomain because  invalidpublic-
                       domain is not a valid top-level domain.

                     o
                       **
                       OTHER ** - Typically, this failure occurs when there is
                       a typographical error in one  or  more  of  the  domain
                       names in the certificate request. Try to request a cer-
                       tificate again, correcting any spelling errors or typos
                       that were in the failed request.

                 inUseResourceCount -> (integer)
                     The number of Lightsail resources that the certificate is
                     attached to.

                     The timestamp when the certificate is first valid.

                 notAfter -> (timestamp)
                     The timestamp when the certificate expires.

                 eligibleToRenew -> (string)
                     The renewal eligibility of the certificate.

                               An object that describes the DNS records to add
                               to  your  domain's  DNS  to validate it for the
                               certificate.

                        The following renewal status are possible:

                        o
                          **
                          PendingAutoRenewal ** - Lightsail is  attempting  to
                          automatically  validate the domain names of the cer-
                          tificate. No further action is required.

                        o
                          **
                          PendingValidation ** - Lightsail couldn't  automati-
                          cally  validate one or more domain names of the cer-
                          tificate. You must take  action  to  validate  these
                          domain  names  or  the certificate won't be renewed.
                          Check to make sure your certificate's domain valida-
                          tion  records  exist  in your domain's DNS, and that
                          your certificate remains in use.

                          **
                          Success ** - All domain names in the certificate are
                          validated, and Lightsail renewed the certificate. No
                          further action is required.

                        o
                          **
                          Failed ** - One or more domain names were not  vali-
                          dated  before the certificate expired, and Lightsail
                          did not renew the certificate. You can request a new
                          certificate using the CreateCertificate action.

                 revocationReason -> (string)
                     The reason the certificate was  revoked.  This  value  is
