       --publicly-accessible | --no-publicly-accessible (boolean)
          Specifies  the  accessibility options for your new database. A value
          of true specifies a database that is available to resources  outside
          of  your  Lightsail  account.  A value of false specifies a database
          that is available only to  your  Lightsail  resources  in  the  same
          region as your database.

       --tags (list)
          The  tag keys and optional values to add to the resource during cre-
          ate.

          Use the TagResource action to tag a resource after it's created.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag key and optional value  assigned  to  an  Amazon
              Lightsail resource.

                 bers, spaces in UTF-8, or the following characters: + - = . _
                 : / @

              value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

                 Constraints: Tag values accept a maximum of 256 letters, num-
                 bers, spaces in UTF-8, or the following characters: + - = . _
                 : / @

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To create a managed database

       The following  create-relational-database  example  creates  a  managed
       database  in  the specified AWS Region and Availability Zone, using the
       MySQL 5.6 database engine (mysql_5_6), and the $15 USD  standard  data-
       base bundle (micro_1_0). The managed database is pre-populated a master
       user name, and is not publicly accessible.

          aws lightsail create-relational-database \
              --relational-database-name Database-1 \
