GET-BUNDLES()                                                    GET-BUNDLES()



NAME
       get-bundles -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  list of bundles that are available for purchase. A bundle
       describes the specs for your virtual private server (or instance ).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-bundles is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be  issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the  results  of  the  following  query
       expressions: bundles

SYNOPSIS
            get-bundles
          [--include-inactive | --no-include-inactive]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --include-inactive | --no-include-inactive (boolean)
          A  Boolean  value  that indicates whether to include inactive bundle
          results in your request.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       bundles -> (list)
          An array of key-value pairs  that  contains  information  about  the
          available bundles.

          (structure)
              Describes a bundle, which is a set of specs describing your vir-
              tual private server (or instance ).

              price -> (float)
                 The price in US dollars (e.g., 5.0 ) of the bundle.

              cpuCount -> (integer)
                 The number of vCPUs included in the bundle (e.g., 2 ).

              diskSizeInGb -> (integer)
                 The size of the SSD (e.g., 30 ).

              bundleId -> (string)
                 The bundle ID (e.g., micro_1_0 ).

              instanceType -> (string)
                 The Amazon EC2 instance type (e.g., t2.micro ).

              isActive -> (boolean)
                 A Boolean value indicating whether the bundle is active.

              name -> (string)
                 A friendly name for the bundle (e.g., Micro ).

              power -> (integer)
                 A numeric value that  represents  the  power  of  the  bundle
                 (e.g.,  500  ).  You can use the bundle's power value in con-
                 junction with a blueprint's minimum power value to  determine
                 whether  the  blueprint  will run on the bundle. For example,
                 you need a bundle with a power value of 500 or more to create
                 an  instance that uses a blueprint with a minimum power value
                 of 500.

              ramSizeInGb -> (float)
                 The amount of RAM in GB (e.g., 2.0 ).

              transferPerMonthInGb -> (integer)
                 The data transfer rate per month in GB (e.g., 2000 ).

              supportedPlatforms -> (list)
                 The operating system platform  (Linux/Unix-based  or  Windows
                 Server-based) that the bundle supports. You can only launch a
                 WINDOWS bundle on a blueprint that supports the WINDOWS plat-
                 form. LINUX_UNIX blueprints require a LINUX_UNIX bundle.

                 (string)

       nextPageToken -> (string)
          The  token to advance to the next page of results from your request.

          A next page token is not returned if there are no  more  results  to
          display.

          To  get the next page of results, perform another GetBundles request
          and specify the next page token using the pageToken parameter.
