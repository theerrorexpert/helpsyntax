DELETE-DOMAIN-ENTRY()                                    DELETE-DOMAIN-ENTRY()



NAME
       delete-domain-entry -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a specific domain entry.

       The delete domain entry operation supports tag-based access control via
       resource tags applied to the resource identified by domain name  .  For
       more information, see the Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-domain-entry
          --domain-name <value>
          --domain-entry <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The name of the domain entry to delete.

       --domain-entry (structure)
          An array of key-value pairs containing information about your domain
          entries.

          id -> (string)
              The ID of the domain recordset entry.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the domain.

          target -> (string)
              The target IP address (e.g., 192.0.2.0 ),  or  AWS  name  server
              (e.g., ns-111.awsdns-22.com. ).

              For   Lightsail   load   balancers,   the   value   looks   like
              ab1234c56789c6b86aba6fb203d443bc-123456789.us-east-2.elb.amazon-
              aws.com  .  For  Lightsail  distributions,  the value looks like
              exampled1182ne.cloudfront.net .  For  Lightsail  container  ser-
              vices,    the   value   looks   like   container-service-1.exam-
              ple23scljs.us-west-2.cs.amazonlightsail.com . Be  sure  to  also
              set  isAlias to true when setting up an A record for a Lightsail
              load balancer, distribution, or container service.

          isAlias -> (boolean)
              When true , specifies whether the domain entry is an alias  used
              by  the  Lightsail  load  balancer.  You can include an alias (A
              type) record in your request, which points to  a  load  balancer
              DNS name and routes traffic to your load balancer.

          type -> (string)
              The  type of domain entry, such as address for IPv4 (A), address
              for IPv6 (AAAA), canonical name (CNAME),  mail  exchanger  (MX),
              name  server  (NS),  start  of  authority (SOA), service locator
              (SRV), or text (TXT).

              The following domain entry types can be used:

              o A

              o AAAA

              o CNAME

              o MX

              o NS

              o SOA

              o SRV

              o TXT

          options -> (map)
              (Deprecated) The options for the domain entry.

              NOTE:
                 In releases prior to November 29, 2017,  this  parameter  was
                 not included in the API response. It is now deprecated.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          id=string,name=string,target=string,isAlias=boolean,type=string,options={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "id": "string",
            "name": "string",
            "target": "string",
            "isAlias": true|false,
            "type": "string",
            "options": {"string": "string"
              ...}
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a domain entry (DNS record)

       The  following delete-domain-entry example deletes the specified domain
       entry from an existing domain.

       Note: Lightsail's domain-related API operations are available  in  only
       the  us-east-1  Region. If your CLI profile is configured to use a dif-
       ferent Region, you must include the --region us-east-1 parameter or the
       command fails.

          aws lightsail delete-domain-entry \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --domain-name example.com \
              --domain-entry name=123.example.com,target=192.0.2.0,type=A

       Output:

          {
