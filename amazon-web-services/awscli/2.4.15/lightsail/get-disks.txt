GET-DISKS()                                                        GET-DISKS()



NAME
       get-disks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about all block storage disks in your AWS account
       and region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-disks is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in
       order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagi-
       nation by providing the --no-paginate argument.   When  using  --output
       text  and  the  --query  argument  on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the  results  of  the  following  query
       expressions: disks

SYNOPSIS
            get-disks
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 NOTE:
                     In  releases  prior  to November 14, 2017, this parameter
                     returned attached for system disks in the  API  response.

              gbInUse -> (integer)
                 (Deprecated) The number of GB in use by the disk.

                 NOTE:
                     In releases prior to November 14,  2017,  this  parameter

                     cated.

       nextPageToken -> (string)
          The token to advance to the next page of results from your  request.

          A  next  page  token is not returned if there are no more results to
          display.

          To get the next page of results, perform  another  GetDisks  request
          and specify the next page token using the pageToken parameter.
