GET-BUCKET-ACCESS-KEYS()                              GET-BUCKET-ACCESS-KEYS()



NAME
       get-bucket-access-keys -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the existing access key IDs for the specified Amazon Lightsail
       bucket.

       WARNING:
          This action does not return the secret access key value of an access
          key.  You  can  get a secret access key only when you create it from
          the response of the  CreateBucketAccessKey action. If you  lose  the
          secret access key, you must create a new access key.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket-access-keys
          --bucket-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket-name (string)
          The name of the bucket for which to return access keys.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       accessKeys -> (list)
          An object that describes the access keys for the specified bucket.

          (structure)
              Describes an access key for an Amazon Lightsail bucket.

              Access  keys  grant  full  programmatic  access to the specified
              bucket and its objects. You can have a  maximum  of  two  access
              keys per bucket. Use the  CreateBucketAccessKey action to create
              an access key for a specific bucket. For more information  about
              access  keys,  see  Creating  access keys for a bucket in Amazon
              Lightsail in the Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide .

              WARNING:
                 The secretAccessKey value is returned only in response to the
                 CreateBucketAccessKey action. You can get a secret access key
                 only when you first create an access key; you cannot get  the
                 secret  access  key later. If you lose the secret access key,
                 you must create a new access key.

              accessKeyId -> (string)
                 The ID of the access key.

              secretAccessKey -> (string)
                 The secret access key used to sign requests.

                 You should store the secret access key in a safe location. We
                 recommend that you delete the access key if the secret access
                 key is compromised.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the access key.

                 A status of Active means that the key is valid,  while  Inac-
                 tive means it is not.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp when the access key was created.

              lastUsed -> (structure)
                 An  object  that  describes  the last time the access key was
                 used.

                 NOTE:
                     This object does not include data in the  response  of  a
                     CreateBucketAccessKey  action.  If the access key has not
                     been used, the region and serviceName values  are  N/A  ,
                     and the lastUsedDate value is null.

                 lastUsedDate -> (timestamp)
                     The  date  and time when the access key was most recently
                     used.

                     This value is null if the access key has not been used.

                 region -> (string)
                     The AWS Region where this access key  was  most  recently
                     used.

                     This value is N/A if the access key has not been used.

                 serviceName -> (string)
                     The  name  of  the AWS service with which this access key
                     was most recently used.

                     This value is N/A if the access key has not been used.
