GET-LOAD-BALANCERS()                                      GET-LOAD-BALANCERS()



NAME
       get-load-balancers -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about all load balancers in an account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-load-balancers  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: loadBalancers

SYNOPSIS
            get-load-balancers
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                        son value is not provided.

                        If  ** instanceHealth ** is initial , the ** instance-
                        HealthReason ** value can be one of the following:

                        o
                          **
                          Lb.RegistrationInProgress ** - The  target  instance
                          is  in the process of being registered with the load
                          balancer.

                        o
                          **
                          Lb.InitialHealthChecking **  -  The  Lightsail  load
                          balancer  is  still  sending the target instance the
                          minimum number of health checks required  to  deter-
                          mine its health status.

                        If   **  instanceHealth  **  is  unhealthy  ,  the  **
                        instanceHealthReason ** value can be one of  the  fol-
                        lowing:

                        o
                          **

                          did not return an expected HTTP code.

                        o
                          **
                          Instance.Timeout **  -  The  health  check  requests
                          timed out.

                        o
                          **
                          Instance.FailedHealthChecks  **  - The health checks
                          failed because the connection to the target instance
                          timed  out,  the  target  instance response was mal-
                          formed, or the target  instance  failed  the  health
                          check for an unknown reason.

                        o

                          to an internal error.

                        If ** instanceHealth ** is unused , the  **  instance-
                        HealthReason ** value can be one of the following:

                        o
                          **
                          Instance.NotRegistered  **  - The target instance is
                          not registered with the target group.

                        o
                          **
                          Instance.NotInUse ** - The target group is not  used
                          by  any  load balancer, or the target instance is in
                          an Availability Zone that is  not  enabled  for  its
                          load balancer.

                        o

                          Instance.IpUnusable  **  -  The target IP address is
                          reserved for use by a Lightsail load balancer.

                        o

                          stopped or terminated state.

                        If ** instanceHealth ** is draining , the ** instance-
                        HealthReason ** value can be one of the following:

                        o
                          **
                          Instance.DeregistrationInProgress **  -  The  target
                          instance is in the process of being deregistered and

              tlsCertificateSummaries -> (list)
                 An array of  LoadBalancerTlsCertificateSummary  objects  that
                 provide  additional  information  about  the SSL/TLS certifi-
                 cates. For example, if true , the certificate is attached  to
                 the load balancer.

                     Provides a summary of SSL/TLS certificate metadata.

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of the SSL/TLS certificate.

                     isAttached -> (boolean)
                        When true , the SSL/TLS certificate is attached to the
                        Lightsail load balancer.

              configurationOptions -> (map)
                 A string to string map of the configuration options for  your
                 load balancer. Valid values are listed below.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              ipAddressType -> (string)
                 The IP address type of the load balancer.

                 The possible values are ipv4 for IPv4 only, and dualstack for
                 IPv4 and IPv6.

       nextPageToken -> (string)
          The token to advance to the next page of results from your  request.

          A  next  page  token is not returned if there are no more results to
          display.

          To get the next page of results,  perform  another  GetLoadBalancers
          request  and specify the next page token using the pageToken parame-
          ter.
