GET-ALARMS()                                                      GET-ALARMS()



NAME
       get-alarms -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about the configured alarms. Specify an alarm name
       in your request to return information about a specific alarm, or  spec-
       ify  a  monitored  resource name to return information about all alarms
       for a specific resource.

       An alarm is used to monitor a single metric for one of your  resources.
       When  a metric condition is met, the alarm can notify you by email, SMS
       text message, and a banner displayed on the Amazon  Lightsail  console.
       For more information, see Alarms in Amazon Lightsail .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-alarms
          [--alarm-name <value>]
          [--page-token <value>]
          [--monitored-resource-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --alarm-name (string)
          The name of the alarm.

          Specify  an alarm name to return information about a specific alarm.

       --page-token (string)
          The token to advance to the next page of results from your  request.

          To  get  a page token, perform an initial GetAlarms request. If your
          results are paginated, the response will return a  next  page  token
          that you can specify as the page token in a subsequent request.

       --monitored-resource-name (string)
          The name of the Lightsail resource being monitored by the alarm.

          Specify  a  monitored  resource name to return information about all
          alarms for a specific resource.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 An object that lists information about the resource monitored
                 by the alarm.

                     tored by alarms.

              comparisonOperator -> (string)
                 The  arithmetic  operation  used when comparing the specified
                 statistic and threshold.

              evaluationPeriods -> (integer)
                 The number of periods over which  data  is  compared  to  the
                 specified threshold.

              period -> (integer)
                 The  period, in seconds, over which the statistic is applied.

              threshold -> (double)
                 The value against which the specified statistic is  compared.

              datapointsToAlarm -> (integer)
                 The  number of data points that must not within the specified
                 threshold to trigger the alarm.

              treatMissingData -> (string)
                 Specifies how the alarm handles missing data points.

                 An alarm can treat missing data in the following ways:

                 o breaching - Assume the  missing  data  is  not  within  the
                   threshold.  Missing data counts towards the number of times
                   the metric is not within the threshold.

                 o notBreaching -  Assume  the  missing  data  is  within  the
                   threshold.  Missing  data does not count towards the number
                   of times the metric is not within the threshold.

                 o ignore - Ignore the missing  data.  Maintains  the  current
                   alarm state.

                 o missing - Missing data is treated as missing.

              statistic -> (string)
                 The statistic for the metric associated with the alarm.

                 The following statistics are available:

                 o Minimum  -  The  lowest value observed during the specified
                   period. Use this value to determine low volumes of activity
                   for your application.

                 o Maximum  -  The highest value observed during the specified
                   period. Use this value to determine high volumes of  activ-
                   ity for your application.

                 o Sum  -  All  values submitted for the matching metric added
                   together. You can use this statistic to determine the total
                   volume of a metric.

                 o Average  - The value of Sum / SampleCount during the speci-
                   fied period. By comparing this statistic with  the  Minimum
                   and  Maximum  values, you can determine the full scope of a
                   metric and how close the average use is to the Minimum  and
                   Maximum  values.  This comparison helps you to know when to
                   increase or decrease your resources.

                 o SampleCount - The count, or number, of data points used for
                   the statistical calculation.

              metricName -> (string)
                 The name of the metric associated with the alarm.

              state -> (string)
                 The current state of the alarm.

                 An alarm has the following possible states:

                 o ALARM - The metric is outside of the defined threshold.

                 o INSUFFICIENT_DATA  - The alarm has just started, the metric
                   is not available, or not enough data is available  for  the
                   metric to determine the alarm state.

                 o OK - The metric is within the defined threshold.

              unit -> (string)
                 The unit of the metric associated with the alarm.

              contactProtocols -> (list)
                 The  contact  protocols  for  the  alarm, such as Email , SMS
                 (text messaging), or both.

                 (string)

              notificationTriggers -> (list)
                 The alarm states that trigger a notification.

                 (string)

              notificationEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the alarm is enabled.

       nextPageToken -> (string)
          The token to advance to the next page of results from your  request.

          A  next  page  token is not returned if there are no more results to
          display.

          To get the next page of results, perform another  GetAlarms  request
          and specify the next page token using the pageToken parameter.
