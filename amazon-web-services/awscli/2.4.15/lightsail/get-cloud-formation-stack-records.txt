GET-CLOUD-FORMATION-STACK-RECORDS()        GET-CLOUD-FORMATION-STACK-RECORDS()



NAME
       get-cloud-formation-stack-records -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the CloudFormation stack record created as a result of the cre-
       ate cloud formation stack operation.

       An AWS CloudFormation stack is used to create a new Amazon EC2 instance
       from an exported Lightsail snapshot.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-cloud-formation-stack-records  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: cloudFormationStackRecords

SYNOPSIS
            get-cloud-formation-stack-records
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       nextPageToken -> (string)
          The  token to advance to the next page of results from your request.

          A next page token is not returned if there are no  more  results  to

          To  get the next page of results, perform another GetCloudFormation-
          StackRecords request and specify the next page token using the page-
          Token parameter.
