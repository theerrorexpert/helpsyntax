NAME
       get-distributions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about one or more of your Amazon Lightsail content
       delivery network (CDN) distributions.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-distributions
          [--distribution-name <value>]
          [--page-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --distribution-name (string)
          The name of the distribution for which to return information.

          When omitted, the response includes all of your distributions in the
          AWS Region where the request is made.

       --page-token (string)
          The  token to advance to the next page of results from your request.

          To get a page token, perform an initial GetDistributions request. If
          your  results  are  paginated,  the response will return a next page
          token that you can  specify  as  the  page  token  in  a  subsequent
          request.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 NOTE:
                     Lightsail distributions are  global  resources  that  can
                     reference an origin in any AWS Region, and distribute its
                     content globally. However, all distributions are  located
                     in the us-east-1 Region.

                 tion, if any.

              origin -> (structure)
                 An object that describes the origin resource of the distribu-
                 tion, such as a Lightsail instance or load balancer.

                     The AWS Region name of the origin resource.

                 protocolPolicy -> (string)
                     The protocol that your Amazon Lightsail distribution uses
                     when  establishing  a connection with your origin to pull

              originPublicDNS -> (string)
                 The public DNS of the origin.

              defaultCacheBehavior -> (structure)
                 An object that describes the default cache  behavior  of  the
                 distribution.

                 behavior -> (string)
                     The cache behavior of the distribution.

                     The following cache behaviors can be specified:

                     o
                       **
                       cache  **  - This option is best for static sites. When
                       specified, your distribution  caches  and  serves  your
                       entire  website  as  static  content.  This behavior is
                       ideal for websites with  static  content  that  doesn't
                       change  depending on who views it, or for websites that
                       don't use cookies, headers, or query strings to person-
                       alize content.

                     o
                       **
                       dont-cache  **  -  This  option  is best for sites that
                       serve a mix of static and dynamic content. When  speci-
                       fied,  your distribution caches and serve only the con-
                       tent that is specified in the  distribution's  CacheBe-
                       haviorPerPath  parameter.  This  behavior  is ideal for
                       websites or web applications that use cookies, headers,
                       and query strings to personalize content for individual
                       users.

              cacheBehaviorSettings -> (structure)
                 An object that describes the cache behavior settings  of  the
                 distribution.

                 defaultTTL -> (long)
                     The  default amount of time that objects stay in the dis-
                     tribution's  cache  before  the   distribution   forwards
                     another  request  to  the origin to determine whether the
                     content has been updated.

                     NOTE:
                        The value specified applies only when the origin  does
                        not  add  HTTP headers such as Cache-Control max-age ,
                        Cache-Control s-maxage , and Expires to objects.

                 minimumTTL -> (long)
                     The minimum amount of time that objects stay in the  dis-
                     tribution's   cache   before  the  distribution  forwards
                     another request to the origin to  determine  whether  the
                     object has been updated.

                     A value of 0 must be specified for minimumTTL if the dis-
                     tribution is configured to forward  all  headers  to  the
                     origin.

                 maximumTTL -> (long)
                     The  maximum amount of time that objects stay in the dis-
                     tribution's  cache  before  the   distribution   forwards
                     another  request  to  the origin to determine whether the
                     object has been updated.

                     The value specified applies only  when  the  origin  adds
                     HTTP  headers  such as Cache-Control max-age , Cache-Con-
                     trol s-maxage , and Expires to objects.

                 allowedHTTPMethods -> (string)
                     The HTTP methods that are processed and forwarded to  the
                     distribution's origin.

                     You can specify the following options:

                     o GET,HEAD  -  The distribution forwards the GET and HEAD
                       methods.

                     o GET,HEAD,OPTIONS - The distribution forwards the GET  ,
                       HEAD , and OPTIONS methods.

                     o GET,HEAD,OPTIONS,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE  - The distribu-
                       tion forwards the GET , HEAD , OPTIONS , PUT , PATCH  ,
                       POST , and DELETE methods.

                     If  you  specify  the  third  option,  you  might need to
                     restrict access to your distribution's  origin  so  users
                     can't perform operations that you don't want them to. For
                     example, you might not want users to have  permission  to
                     delete objects from your origin.

                 cachedHTTPMethods -> (string)
                     The HTTP method responses that are cached by your distri-
                     bution.

                     You can specify the following options:

                     o GET,HEAD - The distribution caches responses to the GET
                       and HEAD methods.

                     o GET,HEAD,OPTIONS - The distribution caches responses to
                       the GET , HEAD , and OPTIONS methods.

                 forwardedCookies -> (structure)
                     An object that describes the cookies that  are  forwarded
                     to  the origin. Your content is cached based on the cook-
                     ies that are forwarded.

                     option -> (string)
                        Specifies which cookies to forward  to  the  distribu-
                        tion's  origin  for  a cache behavior: all , none , or
                        allow-list to forward only the  cookies  specified  in
                        the cookiesAllowList parameter.

                     cookiesAllowList -> (list)
                        The specific cookies to forward to your distribution's
                        origin.

                        (string)

                 forwardedHeaders -> (structure)
                     An object that describes the headers that  are  forwarded
                     to  the origin. Your content is cached based on the head-
                     ers that are forwarded.

                     option -> (string)
                        The headers that you want your distribution to forward
                        to your origin and base caching on.

                        You  can  configure your distribution to do one of the
                        following:

                        o
                          **
                          all ** - Forward all headers to your origin.

                        o
                          **
                          none ** - Forward only the default headers.

                        o
                          **
                          allow-list ** - Forward only the headers you specify
                          using the headersAllowList parameter.

                     headersAllowList -> (list)
                        The specific headers to forward to your distribution's
                        origin.

                        (string)

                 forwardedQueryStrings -> (structure)
                     An object that describes the query strings that are  for-
                     warded to the origin. Your content is cached based on the
                     query strings that are forwarded.

                     option -> (boolean)
                        Indicates whether the distribution forwards and caches
                        based on query strings.

                     queryStringsAllowList -> (list)
                        The  specific query strings that the distribution for-
                        wards to the origin.

                        Your distribution will  cache  content  based  on  the
                        specified query strings.

                        If  the  option parameter is true, then your distribu-
                        tion forwards all query strings,  regardless  of  what
                        you specify using the queryStringsAllowList parameter.

                        (string)

              cacheBehaviors -> (list)
                 An array of objects that describe the per-path cache behavior
                 of the distribution.

                 (structure)
                     Describes the per-path cache behavior of an Amazon Light-
                     sail content delivery network (CDN) distribution.

                     A per-path cache behavior is used to override, or add  an
                     exception  to,  the default cache behavior of a distribu-
                     tion. For example, if the cacheBehavior is set to cache ,
                     then  a  per-path cache behavior can be used to specify a
                     directory, file, or file type that your distribution will
                     cache.  Alternately,  if the distribution's cacheBehavior
                     is dont-cache , then a per-path  cache  behavior  can  be
                     used to specify a directory, file, or file type that your
                     distribution will not cache.

                     if the cacheBehavior's behavior is set to 'cache', then

                     path -> (string)
                        The path to a directory or  file  to  cached,  or  not
                        cache.  Use  an  asterisk  symbol  to specify wildcard
                        directories  (path/to/assets/*  ),  and   file   types
                        (*.html,  *jpg,  *js ). Directories and file paths are
                        case-sensitive.

                        Examples:

                        o Specify the following to cache all files in the doc-
                          ument  root  of  an  Apache  web server running on a
                          Lightsail instance.  var/www/html/

                        o Specify the following file to cache only  the  index
                          page  in  the document root of an Apache web server.
                          var/www/html/index.html

                        o Specify the following to cache only the .html  files
                          in  the  document  root  of  an  Apache  web server.
                          var/www/html/*.html

                        o Specify the following to cache only the .jpg,  .png,
                          and  .gif  files  in the images sub-directory of the
                          document   root   of   an   Apache    web    server.
                          var/www/html/images/*.jpg
                          var/www/html/images/*.png
                          var/www/html/images/*.gif   Specify the following to
                          cache all files in the images sub-directory  of  the
                          document    root    of   an   Apache   web   server.
                          var/www/html/images/

                     behavior -> (string)
                        The cache behavior for the specified path.

                        You can specify one of the  following  per-path  cache
                        behaviors:

                        o
