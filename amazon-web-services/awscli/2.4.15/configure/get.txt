GET()                                                                    GET()



NAME
       get -

DESCRIPTION
       Get a configuration value from the config file.

       The  aws  configure  get  command  can be used to print a configuration
       value in the AWS config file.  The get command supports  two  types  of
       configuration values, unqualified and qualified config values.

       Note  that aws configure get only looks at values in the AWS configura-
       tion file.  It does not resolve configuration variables specified  any-
       where  else,  including  environment variables, command line arguments,
       etc.

   Unqualified Names
       Every value in the AWS configuration file must be placed in  a  section
       (denoted  by  [section-name]  in the config file).  To retrieve a value
       from the config file, the section name and  the  config  name  must  be
       known.

       An  unqualified  configuration name refers to a name that is not scoped
       to a specific section in the configuration file.  Sections  are  speci-
       fied  by separating parts with the "." character (section.config-name).
       An unqualified name will be scoped to the current profile.   For  exam-
       ple,   aws   configure   get   aws_access_key_id   will   retrieve  the
       aws_access_key_id from the current profile,  or the default profile  if
       no profile is specified.  You can still provide a --profile argument to
       the aws configure get command.  For example, aws configure  get  region
       --profile  testing will print the region value for the testing profile.

   Qualified Names
       A qualified name is a name that has at least one "." character  in  the
       name.   This  name  provides  a  way to specify the config section from
       which to retrieve the config variable.  When a qualified name  is  pro-
       vided to aws configure get, the currently specified profile is ignored.
       Section names that have the format [profile profile-name] can be speci-
       fied  by  using  the  profile.profile-name.config-name  syntax, and the
       default profile can be specified using the default.config-name  syntax.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
          aws configure get varname [--profile profile-name]

OPTIONS
       varname (string) The name of the config value to retrieve.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Suppose you had the following config file:

          [default]
          aws_access_key_id=default_access_key
          aws_secret_access_key=default_secret_key

          [profile testing]
          aws_access_key_id=testing_access_key
          aws_secret_access_key=testing_secret_key
          region=us-west-2

       The following commands would have the corresponding output:

          $ aws configure get aws_access_key_id
          default_access_key

          $ aws configure get default.aws_access_key_id
          default_access_key

          $ aws configure get aws_access_key_id --profile testing
          testing_access_key

          $ aws configure get profile.testing.aws_access_key_id
          testing_access_key

          $ aws configure get profile.does-not-exist
          $
          $ echo $?
          1



                                                                         GET()
