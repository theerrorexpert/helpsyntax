GET-LATEST-CONFIGURATION()                          GET-LATEST-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       get-latest-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the latest deployed configuration. This API may return empty
       Configuration data if the client already has the  latest  version.  See
       StartConfigurationSession  to  obtain  an  InitialConfigurationToken to
       call this API.

       WARNING:
          Each call to GetLatestConfiguration returns a new ConfigurationToken
          (NextPollConfigurationToken in the response). This new token MUST be
          provided to the next call to GetLatestConfiguration when polling for
          configuration updates.

          To  avoid  excess charges, we recommend that you include the Client-
          ConfigurationVersion value with every  call  to  GetConfiguration  .
          This value must be saved on your client. Subsequent calls to GetCon-
          figuration must pass this value by using the ClientConfigurationVer-
          sion parameter.

SYNOPSIS
            get-latest-configuration
          --configuration-token <value>
          <outfile>

OPTIONS
       --configuration-token (string)
          Token  describing the current state of the configuration session. To
          obtain a token, first call the StartConfigurationSession  API.  Note
          that every call to GetLatestConfiguration will return a new Configu-
          rationToken (NextPollConfigurationToken in the response) and MUST be
          provided to subsequent GetLatestConfiguration API calls.

       outfile (string) Filename where the content will be saved

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Configuration -> (blob)
          The  data  of  the configuration. Note that this may be empty if the
          client already has the latest version of configuration.

       ContentType -> (string)
          A standard MIME type describing the format of the configuration con-
          tent.

       NextPollConfigurationToken -> (string)
          The  latest  token describing the current state of the configuration
          session. This MUST be provided to the next call to GetLatestConfigu-
          ration.

       NextPollIntervalInSeconds -> (integer)
          The amount of time the client should wait before polling for config-
          uration updates again. See  RequiredMinimumPollIntervalInSeconds  to
          set the desired poll interval.
