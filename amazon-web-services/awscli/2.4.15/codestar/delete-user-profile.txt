DELETE-USER-PROFILE()                                    DELETE-USER-PROFILE()



NAME
       delete-user-profile -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a user profile in AWS CodeStar, including all personal prefer-
       ence data associated with that profile, such as display name and  email
       address.  It  does not delete the history of that user, for example the
       history of commits made by that user.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-user-profile
          --user-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the  user  to  delete  from  AWS
          CodeStar.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          {
              "userArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/intern"
          }

       userArn -> (string)
          The Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the  user  deleted  from  AWS
          CodeStar.
