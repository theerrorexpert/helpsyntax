NAME
       create-user-profile -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  profile  for a user that includes user preferences, such as
       the display name and email address assocciated with the  user,  in  AWS
       CodeStar.  The user profile is not project-specific. Information in the
       user profile is displayed wherever the user's  information  appears  to
       other users in AWS CodeStar.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-user-profile
          --user-arn <value>
          --display-name <value>
          --email-address <value>
          [--ssh-public-key <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the user in IAM.

       --display-name (string)
          The name that will be displayed as the friendly name for the user in
          AWS CodeStar.

       --email-address (string)
          The email address that will be displayed as part of the user's  pro-
          file in AWS CodeStar.

       --ssh-public-key (string)
          The  SSH  public  key associated with the user in AWS CodeStar. If a
          project owner allows the user remote access  to  project  resources,
          this  public  key will be used along with the user's private key for
          SSH access.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a user profile

       The following create-user-profile example creates a  user  profile  for
       the IAM user with the specified ARN.

          aws codestar create-user-profile \
              --user-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/intern \
              --display-name Intern \
              --email-address intern@example.com

       Output:

          {
              "userArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/intern",
              "displayName": "Intern",
              "emailAddress": "intern@example.com",
              "sshPublicKey": "",
              "createdTimestamp": 1572552308.607,
              "lastModifiedTimestamp": 1572552308.607
          }

OUTPUT
       userArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the user in IAM.

          AWS CodeStar.

       sshPublicKey -> (string)
          The SSH public key associated with the user in AWS CodeStar. This is
          the public portion of the public/private keypair the user can use to
          access  project  resources if a project owner allows the user remote
          access to those resources.

       createdTimestamp -> (timestamp)
