DELETE-PROJECT()                                              DELETE-PROJECT()



NAME
       delete-project -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  project, including project resources. Does not delete users
       associated with the project, but does delete the IAM roles that allowed
       access to the project.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-project
          --id <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--delete-stack | --no-delete-stack]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The ID of the project to be deleted in AWS CodeStar.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A  user-  or  system-generated token that identifies the entity that
          requested project deletion. This token can be  used  to  repeat  the
          request.

       --delete-stack | --no-delete-stack (boolean)
          Whether to send a delete request for the primary stack in AWS Cloud-
          Formation originally used to generate the project and its resources.
          This  option  will  delete all AWS resources for the project (except
          for any buckets in Amazon  S3)  as  well  as  deleting  the  project
          itself. Recommended for most use cases.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a project

       The following delete-project example deletes the specified project.

          aws codestar delete-project \
              --project-id my-project

       Output:

          {
              "projectArn": "arn:aws:codestar:us-east-2:123456789012:project/my-project"
          }

OUTPUT
       stackId -> (string)
          The  ID  of  the  primary  stack  in AWS CloudFormation that will be
          deleted as part of deleting the project and its resources.

       projectArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the deleted project.
