DESCRIBE-USER-PROFILE()                                DESCRIBE-USER-PROFILE()



NAME
       describe-user-profile -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  a  user  in  AWS CodeStar and the user attributes across all
       projects.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-user-profile
          --user-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the user.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To view a user profile

       The following describe-user-profile example retrieves details about the
       user profile for the user with the specified ARN.

          aws codestar describe-user-profile \
              --user-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/intern

       Output:

          {
              "userArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/intern",
              "displayName": "Intern",
              "emailAddress": "intern@example.com",
              "sshPublicKey": "intern",
              "createdTimestamp": 1572552308.607,
              "lastModifiedTimestamp": 1572553495.47
          }

OUTPUT
       userArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the user.

       displayName -> (string)
          The  display  name  shown for the user in AWS CodeStar projects. For
          example, this could be set  to  both  first  and  last  name  ("Mary
          Major")  or a single name ("Mary"). The display name is also used to
          generate the initial icon associated with the user in  AWS  CodeStar
          projects.  If  spaces  are  included  in the display name, the first
          character that appears after the space will be used  as  the  second
          character in the user initial icon. The initial icon displays a max-
          imum of two characters, so a display name with more than  one  space
          (for example "Mary Jane Major") would generate an initial icon using
          the first character and the first character after the  space  ("MJ",
          not "MM").

       emailAddress -> (string)
          The email address for the user. Optional.

       sshPublicKey -> (string)
          The  SSH public key associated with the user. This SSH public key is
          associated with the user profile, and can  be  used  in  conjunction
          with  the  associated  private  key for access to project resources,
          such as Amazon EC2 instances,  if  a  project  owner  grants  remote
          access to those resources.

       createdTimestamp -> (timestamp)
          The date and time when the user profile was created in AWS CodeStar,
          in timestamp format.

       lastModifiedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
          The date and time when the user profile was last modified, in  time-
          stamp format.
