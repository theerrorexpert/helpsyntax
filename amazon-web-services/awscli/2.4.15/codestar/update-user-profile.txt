UPDATE-USER-PROFILE()                                    UPDATE-USER-PROFILE()



NAME
       update-user-profile -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  a  user's  profile  in  AWS  CodeStar. The user profile is not
       project-specific. Information in the user profile is displayed wherever
       the user's information appears to other users in AWS CodeStar.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-user-profile
          --user-arn <value>
          [--display-name <value>]
          [--email-address <value>]
          [--ssh-public-key <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-arn (string)
          The name that will be displayed as the friendly name for the user in
          AWS CodeStar.

       --display-name (string)
          The name that is displayed as the friendly name for the user in  AWS
          CodeStar.

       --email-address (string)
          The email address that is displayed as part of the user's profile in
          AWS CodeStar.

       --ssh-public-key (string)
          The SSH public key associated with the user in AWS  CodeStar.  If  a
          project  owner  allows  the user remote access to project resources,
          this public key will be used along with the user's private  key  for
          SSH access.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To modify a user profile

       The following update-user-profile example adds the specified SHH key to
       the specified user.

          aws codestar update-user-profile \
              --ssh-public-key intern \
              --user-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/intern

       Output:

          {
              "userArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/intern",
              "displayName": "Intern",
              "emailAddress": "intern@example.com",
              "sshPublicKey": "intern",
              "createdTimestamp": 1572552308.607,
              "lastModifiedTimestamp": 1572553495.47
          }

OUTPUT
       userArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the user in IAM.

          AWS CodeStar.

       sshPublicKey -> (string)
          The SSH public key associated with the user in AWS CodeStar. This is
          the public portion of the public/private keypair the user can use to
          access project resources if a project owner allows the  user  remote
          access to those resources.

       createdTimestamp -> (timestamp)
