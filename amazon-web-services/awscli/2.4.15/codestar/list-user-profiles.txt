LIST-USER-PROFILES()                                      LIST-USER-PROFILES()



NAME
       list-user-profiles -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  the  user  profiles  configured for your AWS account in AWS
       CodeStar.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-user-profiles is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: userProfiles

SYNOPSIS
            list-user-profiles
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To view a list of user profiles

       The following list-user-profiles example retrieves a list of  all  user
       profiles in the current Region.

          aws codestar list-user-profiles

       Output:

          {
              "userProfiles": [
                  {
                      "userArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/admin",
                      "displayName": "me",
                      "emailAddress": "me@example.com",
                      "sshPublicKey": ""
                  },
                  {
                      "userArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/intern",
                      "displayName": "Intern",
                      "emailAddress": "intern@example.com",
                      "sshPublicKey": "intern"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       userProfiles -> (list)
          All the user profiles configured in AWS CodeStar for an AWS account.

          (structure)
              Information about a user's profile in AWS CodeStar.

              userArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the user in IAM.

              displayName -> (string)
                 The display name of a user in AWS CodeStar. For example, this
                 could  be set to both first and last name ("Mary Major") or a
                 single name ("Mary"). The display name is also used to gener-
                 ate the initial icon associated with the user in AWS CodeStar
                 projects. If spaces are included in  the  display  name,  the
                 first  character that appears after the space will be used as
                 the second character in the user initial  icon.  The  initial
                 icon  displays a maximum of two characters, so a display name
                 with more than one space  (for  example  "Mary  Jane  Major")
                 would  generate an initial icon using the first character and
                 the first character after the space ("MJ", not "MM").

              emailAddress -> (string)
                 The email address associated with the user.

              sshPublicKey -> (string)
                 The SSH public key associated with the user in AWS  CodeStar.
                 If  a  project owner allows the user remote access to project
                 resources, this public key will be used along with the user's
                 private key for SSH access.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  continuation  token  to  use  when  requesting  the next set of
          results, if there are more results to be returned.
