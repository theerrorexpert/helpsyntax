CREATE-PROJECT()                                              CREATE-PROJECT()



NAME
       create-project -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  project, including project resources. This action creates a
       project based on a submitted project request.  A  set  of  source  code
       files  and  a  toolchain template file can be included with the project
       request. If these are not provided, an empty project is created.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The display name for the project to be created in AWS CodeStar.

       --id (string)
          The ID of the project to be created in AWS CodeStar.

       --description (string)
          The description of the project, if any.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A user- or system-generated token that identifies  the  entity  that
          requested  project  creation.  This  token can be used to repeat the
          request.

       --source-code (list)
          A list of the Code objects submitted with the  project  request.  If
          this  parameter  is  specified,  the  request  must also include the
          toolchain parameter.

          (structure)
              Location and destination information about the source code files
              provided  with  the project request. The source code is uploaded
              to the new project source repository after project creation.

              source -> (structure)
                 The location where the source code files  provided  with  the
                 project  request are stored. AWS CodeStar retrieves the files
                 during project creation.

                 s3 -> (structure)
                     Information about the Amazon S3 location where the source
                     code  files provided with the project request are stored.

                     bucketName -> (string)
                        The Amazon S3 bucket name where the source code  files
                        provided with the project request are stored.

                     bucketKey -> (string)
                        The  Amazon  S3 object key where the source code files
                        provided with the project request are stored.

              destination -> (structure)
                 The repository to be created in AWS  CodeStar.  Valid  values
                 are  AWS  CodeCommit or GitHub. After AWS CodeStar provisions
                 the new repository, the source code files provided  with  the
                 project request are placed in the repository.

                 codeCommit -> (structure)
                     Information  about  the  AWS  CodeCommit repository to be
                     created in AWS CodeStar. This is where  the  source  code
                     files  provided with the project request will be uploaded
                     after project creation.

                     vided  with  the  project  request will be uploaded after
                     project creation.

                     name -> (string)
                        Name of the GitHub repository to  be  created  in  AWS
                        CodeStar.

                        itory  to  be created in AWS CodeStar. If this reposi-
                        tory should be owned by a GitHub organization, provide
                        its name.

                     privateRepository -> (boolean)
                        Whether  the  GitHub  repository  is  to  be a private

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

                  }
              }
          }

       Output:
