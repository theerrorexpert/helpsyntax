DESCRIPTION
       Searches  network profiles and lists the ones that meet a set of filter
       and sort criteria.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            search-network-profiles
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--sort-criteria <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          An optional token returned from a prior request. Use this token  for
          pagination  of results from this action. If this parameter is speci-
          fied, the response includes only results beyond the token, up to the
          value specified by MaxResults.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of results to include in the response. If more
          results exist than  the  specified  MaxResults  value,  a  token  is
          included  in  the  response  so  that  the  remaining results can be
          retrieved.

       --filters (list)
          The filters to use to list a  specified  set  of  network  profiles.
          Valid filters are NetworkProfileName, Ssid, and SecurityType.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results. Filters can be used to  match  a  set  of
              resources by various criteria.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of a filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 The values of a filter.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --sort-criteria (list)
          The sort order to use to list the specified set of network profiles.
          Valid sort criteria includes NetworkProfileName, Ssid, and Security-
          Type.

          (structure)
              An object representing a sort criteria.

              Key -> (string)
                 The sort key of a sort object.

              Value -> (string)
                 The sort value of a sort object.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "ASC"|"DESC"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
