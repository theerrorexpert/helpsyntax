NAME
       get-conference-provider -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets details about a specific conference provider.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-conference-provider
          --conference-provider-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --conference-provider-arn (string)
          The ARN of the newly created conference provider.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 The IP address.

              CommsProtocol -> (string)
                 The protocol, including SIP, SIPS, and H323.

          PSTNDialIn -> (structure)

              OneClickIdDelay -> (string)
                 The delay duration before Alexa enters the conference ID with
                 dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF). Each number on the dial pad
                 corresponds  to  a  DTMF tone, which is how we send data over
                 the telephone network.

              OneClickPinDelay -> (string)
                 The delay duration before Alexa  enters  the  conference  pin
                 with  dual-tone  multi-frequency  (DTMF).  Each number on the
                 dial pad corresponds to a DTMF tone, which  is  how  we  send
                 data over the telephone network.
