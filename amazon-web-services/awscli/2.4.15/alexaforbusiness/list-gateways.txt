LIST-GATEWAYS()                                                LIST-GATEWAYS()



NAME
       list-gateways -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  list  of  gateway  summaries.  Use GetGateway to retrieve
       details of a specific gateway. An optional gateway  group  ARN  can  be
       provided  to only retrieve gateway summaries of gateways that are asso-
       ciated with that gateway group ARN.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-gateways
          [--gateway-group-arn <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-group-arn (string)
          The gateway group ARN for which to list gateways.

       --next-token (string)
          The token used to paginate though multiple  pages  of  gateway  sum-
          maries.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of gateway summaries to return. The default is
          50.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Gateways -> (list)
          The gateways in the list.

          (structure)
              The summary of a gateway.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the gateway.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the gateway.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the gateway.

              GatewayGroupArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the gateway group that the gateway  is  associated
                 to.

              SoftwareVersion -> (string)
                 The  software  version  of the gateway. The gateway automati-
                 cally updates its software version during normal operation.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token used to paginate though multiple  pages  of  gateway  sum-
          maries.
