GET-NETWORK-PROFILE()                                    GET-NETWORK-PROFILE()



NAME
       get-network-profile -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the network profile details by the network profile ARN.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-network-profile
          --network-profile-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --network-profile-arn (string)
          The ARN of the network profile associated with a device.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get network profile details

       The  following  get-network-profile  example  retrieves  details of the
       specified network profile.

          aws alexaforbusiness get-network-profile \
              --network-profile-arn arn:aws:a4b:us-east-1:123456789012:network-profile/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111

       Output:

          {
              "NetworkProfile": {
                  "NetworkProfileArn": "arn:aws:a4b:us-east-1:123456789012:network-profile/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222",
                  "NetworkProfileName": "Networkprofile",
                  "Ssid": "Janenetwork",
                  "SecurityType": "WPA2_PSK",
                  "CurrentPassword": "12345"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       NetworkProfile -> (structure)
          The network profile associated with a device.

          NetworkProfileArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the network profile associated with a device.

          NetworkProfileName -> (string)
              The name of the network profile associated with a device.

          Description -> (string)
              Detailed information about a device's network profile.

          Ssid -> (string)
              The SSID of the Wi-Fi network.

          SecurityType -> (string)
              The  security type of the Wi-Fi network. This can be WPA2_ENTER-
              PRISE, WPA2_PSK, WPA_PSK, WEP, or OPEN.

          EapMethod -> (string)
              The authentication standard that is used in the  EAP  framework.
              Currently, EAP_TLS is supported.

          CurrentPassword -> (string)
              The current password of the Wi-Fi network.

          NextPassword -> (string)
              The  next,  or  subsequent,  password of the Wi-Fi network. This
              password is asynchronously transmitted to the device and is used
              when the password of the network changes to NextPassword.

          CertificateAuthorityArn -> (string)
              The  ARN  of  the Private Certificate Authority (PCA) created in
              AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). This is used  to  issue  certifi-
              cates to the devices.

          TrustAnchors -> (list)
              The  root  certificates  of your authentication server, which is
              installed on your devices and used to trust your  authentication
              server during EAP negotiation.

              (string)
