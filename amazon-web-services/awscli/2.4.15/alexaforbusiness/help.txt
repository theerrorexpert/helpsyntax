DESCRIPTION
       Alexa  for Business helps you use Alexa in your organization. Alexa for
       Business provides you with the tools to manage  Alexa  devices,  enroll
       your  users,  and  assign skills, at scale. You can build your own con-
       text-aware voice skills using the Alexa Skills Kit and  the  Alexa  for
       Business  API  operations. You can also make these available as private
       skills for your organization. Alexa for Business makes it efficient  to
       voice-enable  your  products and services, thus providing context-aware
       voice experiences for your customers. Device makers building  with  the
       Alexa Voice Service (AVS) can create fully integrated solutions, regis-
       ter their products with Alexa for Business, and manage them  as  shared
       devices in their organization.
