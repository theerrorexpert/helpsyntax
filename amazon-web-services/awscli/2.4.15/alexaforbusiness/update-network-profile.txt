SYNOPSIS
            update-network-profile
          --network-profile-arn <value>
          [--network-profile-name <value>]
          [--description <value>]
          [--current-password <value>]
          [--next-password <value>]
          [--certificate-authority-arn <value>]
          [--trust-anchors <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --network-profile-arn (string)
          The ARN of the network profile associated with a device.

       --network-profile-name (string)
          The name of the network profile associated with a device.

       --description (string)
          Detailed information about a device's network profile.

       --current-password (string)
          The current password of the Wi-Fi network.

       --next-password (string)
          The  next,  or subsequent, password of the Wi-Fi network. This pass-
          word is asynchronously transmitted to the device and  is  used  when
          the password of the network changes to NextPassword.

       --certificate-authority-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of  the Private Certificate Authority (PCA) created in AWS
          Certificate Manager (ACM). This is used to issue certificates to the
          devices.

       --trust-anchors (list)
          The  root  certificate(s) of your authentication server that will be
          installed on your devices and  used  to  trust  your  authentication
          server during EAP negotiation.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update a network profile

       The following update-network-profile example updates the specified net-
       work profile by using the network profile ARN.

          aws alexaforbusiness update-network-profile \
              --network-profile-arn arn:aws:a4b:us-east-1:123456789012:network-profile/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111 \
              --network-profile-name Networkprofile

       This command produces no output.
