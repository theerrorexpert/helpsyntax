RESOLVE-ROOM()                                                  RESOLVE-ROOM()



NAME
       resolve-room -

DESCRIPTION
       Determines  the  details  for  the  room from which a skill request was
       invoked. This operation is used by skill developers.

       To query ResolveRoom from an Alexa skill, the  skill  ID  needs  to  be
       authorized.  When  the skill is using an AWS Lambda function, the skill
       is automatically authorized when you publish your skill  as  a  private
       skill  to  your  AWS account. Skills that are hosted using a custom web
       service must be manually authorized. To get your skill authorized, con-
       tact  AWS Support with your AWS account ID that queries the ResolveRoom
       API and skill ID.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            resolve-room
          --user-id <value>
          --skill-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-id (string)
          The ARN of the user. Required.

       --skill-id (string)
          The ARN of the skill that was requested. Required.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RoomArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the room from which the skill request was invoked.

       RoomName -> (string)
          The name of the room from which the skill request was invoked.

       RoomSkillParameters -> (list)
          Response to get the room profile request. Required.

          (structure)
              A skill parameter associated with a room.

              ParameterKey -> (string)
                 The parameter key of a room skill parameter. ParameterKey  is
                 an  enumerated type that only takes DEFAULT or SCOPE as valid
                 values.

              ParameterValue -> (string)
                 The parameter value of a room skill parameter.
