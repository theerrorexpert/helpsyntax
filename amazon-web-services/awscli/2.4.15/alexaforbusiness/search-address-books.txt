SYNOPSIS
            search-address-books
          [--filters <value>]
          [--sort-criteria <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          The filters to use to list a specified set  of  address  books.  The
          supported filter key is AddressBookName.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results. Filters can be used to  match  a  set  of
              resources by various criteria.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of a filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 The values of a filter.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --sort-criteria (list)
          The sort order to use in listing the specified set of address books.
          The supported sort key is AddressBookName.

          (structure)
              An object representing a sort criteria.

              Key -> (string)
                 The sort key of a sort object.

              Value -> (string)
                 The sort value of a sort object.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "ASC"|"DESC"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --next-token (string)
          An optional token returned from a prior request. Use this token  for
          pagination  of results from this action. If this parameter is speci-
          fied, the response only includes results beyond the token, up to the
          value specified by MaxResults.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of results to include in the response. If more
          results exist than  the  specified  MaxResults  value,  a  token  is
          included  in  the  response  so  that  the  remaining results can be
          retrieved.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
