DESCRIPTION
       A  load  balancer  can  distribute  incoming  traffic  across  your EC2
       instances. This enables you to increase the availability of your appli-
       cation.  The  load  balancer also monitors the health of its registered
       instances and ensures that it routes traffic only to healthy instances.
       You configure your load balancer to accept incoming traffic by specify-
       ing one or more listeners, which are configured  with  a  protocol  and
       port  number  for  connections  from clients to the load balancer and a
       protocol and port number for connections from the load balancer to  the
       instances.

       Elastic Load Balancing supports three types of load balancers: Applica-
       tion Load Balancers, Network Load  Balancers,  and  Classic  Load  Bal-
       ancers. You can select a load balancer based on your application needs.
       For more information, see the Elastic Load Balancing User Guide .

       This reference covers the 2012-06-01 API, which supports  Classic  Load
       Balancers.  The  2015-12-01 API supports Application Load Balancers and
       Network Load Balancers.

       To get started, create a load balancer with one or more listeners using
       CreateLoadBalancer  .  Register  your  instances with the load balancer
       using  RegisterInstancesWithLoadBalancer .

       All Elastic Load Balancing operations are idempotent , which means that
       they complete at most one time. If you repeat an operation, it succeeds
       with a 200 OK response code.
