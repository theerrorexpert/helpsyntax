CREATE-DATABASE()                                            CREATE-DATABASE()



NAME
       create-database -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new Timestream database. If the KMS key is not specified, the
       database will be encrypted with a Timestream managed KMS key located in
       your  account.  Refer  to Amazon Web Services managed KMS keys for more
       info. Service quotas apply . See code sample for details.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-database
          --database-name <value>
          [--kms-key-id <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --database-name (string)
          The name of the Timestream database.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The KMS key for the database. If the KMS key is not  specified,  the
          database will be encrypted with a Timestream managed KMS key located
          in your account. Refer to Amazon Web Services managed KMS  keys  for
          more info.

       --tags (list)
          A list of key-value pairs to label the table.

          (structure)
              A tag is a label that you assign to a Timestream database and/or
              table. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of
              which you define. Tags enable you to categorize databases and/or
              tables, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag. Tag keys are case sensitive.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag. Tag values are case-sensitive  and  can
                 be null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Database -> (structure)
          The newly created Timestream database.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name that uniquely identifies this database.

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              The name of the Timestream database.

          TableCount -> (long)
              The total number of tables found within a Timestream database.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              The identifier of the KMS key used to encrypt the data stored in
              the database.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              The time when the database was created, calculated from the Unix
              epoch time.

          LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
              The last time that this database was updated.
