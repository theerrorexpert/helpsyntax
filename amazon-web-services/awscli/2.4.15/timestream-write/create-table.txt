CREATE-TABLE()                                                  CREATE-TABLE()



NAME
       create-table -

DESCRIPTION
       The  CreateTable  operation adds a new table to an existing database in
       your account. In an Amazon Web Services account, table names must be at
       least  unique  within each Region if they are in the same database. You
       may have identical table names in the same Region if the tables are  in
       separate  databases. While creating the table, you must specify the ta-
       ble name, database name, and the retention properties.  Service  quotas
       apply . See code sample for details.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --database-name (string)
          The name of the Timestream database.

       --table-name (string)
          The name of the Timestream table.

       --retention-properties (structure)
          The  duration  for which your time series data must be stored in the
          memory store and the magnetic store.

          MemoryStoreRetentionPeriodInHours -> (long)
              The duration for which data must be stored in the memory  store.

          MagneticStoreRetentionPeriodInDays -> (long)
              The  duration  for  which  data  must  be stored in the magnetic
              store.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MemoryStoreRetentionPeriodInHours=long,MagneticStoreRetentionPeriodInDays=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MemoryStoreRetentionPeriodInHours": long,
            "MagneticStoreRetentionPeriodInDays": long
          }

       --tags (list)
          A list of key-value pairs to label the table.

          (structure)
              A tag is a label that you assign to a Timestream database and/or
              table. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of
              which you define. Tags enable you to categorize databases and/or
              tables, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag. Tag keys are case sensitive.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value  of the tag. Tag values are case-sensitive and can
                 be null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --magnetic-store-write-properties (structure)
          Contains properties to set on the table when enabling magnetic store
          writes.

          EnableMagneticStoreWrites -> (boolean)
              A flag to enable magnetic store writes.

          MagneticStoreRejectedDataLocation -> (structure)
              The  location  to write error reports for records rejected asyn-
              chronously during magnetic store writes.

              S3Configuration -> (structure)
                 Configuration of an S3 location to write  error  reports  for
                 records   rejected,  asynchronously,  during  magnetic  store
                 writes.

                 BucketName -> (string)
                     >Bucket name of the customer S3 bucket.

                 ObjectKeyPrefix -> (string)
                     Object key preview for the customer S3 location.

                 EncryptionOption -> (string)
                     Encryption option for the customer s3  location.  Options
                     are  S3  server side encryption with an S3-managed key or
                     KMS managed key.

                 KmsKeyId -> (string)
                     KMS key id for the customer s3 location  when  encrypting
                     with a KMS managed key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          EnableMagneticStoreWrites=boolean,MagneticStoreRejectedDataLocation={S3Configuration={BucketName=string,ObjectKeyPrefix=string,EncryptionOption=string,KmsKeyId=string}}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "EnableMagneticStoreWrites": true|false,
            "MagneticStoreRejectedDataLocation": {
              "S3Configuration": {
                "BucketName": "string",
                "ObjectKeyPrefix": "string",
                "EncryptionOption": "SSE_S3"|"SSE_KMS",
                "KmsKeyId": "string"
              }
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.
