NAME
       get-compliance-detail -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  detailed  compliance  information  about  the specified member
       account. Details include resources that are in and  out  of  compliance
       with the specified policy.

       o Resources  are  considered  noncompliant  for WAF and Shield Advanced
         policies if the specified policy has not been applied to them.

       o Resources are considered noncompliant for security group policies  if
         they are in scope of the policy, they violate one or more of the pol-
         icy rules, and remediation is disabled or not possible.

       o Resources are considered noncompliant for Network  Firewall  policies
         if  a  firewall is missing in the VPC, if the firewall endpoint isn't
         set up in an expected Availability Zone and subnet, if a subnet  cre-
         ated  by  the Firewall Manager doesn't have the expected route table,
         and for modifications to a firewall policy that violate the  Firewall
         Manager policy's rules.

       o Resources  are considered noncompliant for DNS Firewall policies if a
         DNS Firewall rule group is missing from the rule  group  associations
         for the VPC.

SYNOPSIS
            get-compliance-detail
          --policy-id <value>
          --member-account <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --policy-id (string)
          The  ID of the policy that you want to get the details for. PolicyId
          is returned by PutPolicy and by ListPolicies .

       --member-account (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account that owns  the  resources  that  you
          want to get the details for.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve the compliance information for an account

       The following get-compliance-detail example retrieves compliance infor-
       mation for the specified policy and member account.

          aws fms get-compliance-detail \
              --policy-id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111 \
              --member-account 123456789012

       Output:

          {
              "PolicyComplianceDetail": {
              "EvaluationLimitExceeded": false,
              "IssueInfoMap": {},
              "MemberAccount": "123456789012",
              "PolicyId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
              "PolicyOwner": "123456789012",
              "Violators": []
          }
