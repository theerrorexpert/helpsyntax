NAME
       get-violation-details -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  violations  for  a  resource based on the specified Firewall
       Manager policy and Amazon Web Services account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-violation-details
          --policy-id <value>
          --member-account <value>
          --resource-id <value>
          --resource-type <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --policy-id (string)
          The ID of the Firewall Manager policy that you want the details for.
          This  currently only supports security group content audit policies.

       --member-account (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID that you want the details for.

       --resource-id (string)
          The ID of the resource that has violations.

       --resource-type (string)
          The resource type. This is in the format shown  in  the  Amazon  Web
          Services  Resource  Types  Reference . Supported resource types are:
          AWS::EC2::Instance , AWS::EC2::NetworkInterface ,  AWS::EC2::Securi-
          tyGroup  , AWS::NetworkFirewall::FirewallPolicy , and AWS::EC2::Sub-
          net .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     are case-sensitive.
