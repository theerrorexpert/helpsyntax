GET-PROTECTION-STATUS()                                GET-PROTECTION-STATUS()



NAME
       get-protection-status -

DESCRIPTION
       If  you  created  a Shield Advanced policy, returns policy-level attack
       summary information in the event of a potential DDoS attack. Other pol-
       icy types are currently unsupported.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-protection-status
          --policy-id <value>
          [--member-account-id <value>]
          [--start-time <value>]
          [--end-time <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --policy-id (string)
          The  ID  of the policy for which you want to get the attack informa-
          tion.

       --member-account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account that is in scope of the policy  that
          you want to get the details for.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The  start  of  the  time period to query for the attacks. This is a
          timestamp type. The request syntax listing indicates a  number  type
          because  the  default  used by Firewall Manager is Unix time in sec-
          onds. However, any valid timestamp format is allowed.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end of the time period to query for the attacks. This is a time-
          stamp  type.  The  request  syntax  listing  indicates a number type
          because the default used by Firewall Manager is Unix  time  in  sec-
          onds. However, any valid timestamp format is allowed.

       --next-token (string)
          If you specify a value for MaxResults and you have more objects than
          the number that  you  specify  for  MaxResults  ,  Firewall  Manager
          returns  a  NextToken  value  in  the response, which you can use to
          retrieve another group of objects. For  the  second  and  subsequent
          GetProtectionStatus  requests,  specify  the value of NextToken from
          the previous response to get  information  about  another  batch  of
          objects.

       --max-results (integer)
          Specifies  the  number  of objects that you want Firewall Manager to
          return for this request. If you have more objects  than  the  number
          that  you specify for MaxResults , the response includes a NextToken
          value that you can use to get another batch of objects.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AdminAccountId -> (string)
          The ID of the Firewall Manager administrator account for  this  pol-
          icy.

       ServiceType -> (string)
          The service type that is protected by the policy. Currently, this is
          always SHIELD_ADVANCED .

       Data -> (string)
          Details about the attack, including the following:

          o Attack type

          o Account ID

          o ARN of the resource attacked

          o Start time of the attack

          o End time of the attack (ongoing attacks will not have an end time)

          The details are in JSON format.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  you  have  more  objects  than the number that you specified for
          MaxResults in the request, the response includes a NextToken  value.
          To  list  more  objects, submit another GetProtectionStatus request,
          and specify the NextToken value from the response in  the  NextToken
          value in the next request.

          Amazon Web Services SDKs provide auto-pagination that identify Next-
          Token in a response and make subsequent request calls  automatically
          on your behalf. However, this feature is not supported by GetProtec-
          tionStatus . You must  submit  subsequent  requests  with  NextToken
          using your own processes.
