SYNOPSIS
            put-apps-list
          --apps-list <value>
          [--tag-list <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --apps-list (structure)
          The details of the Firewall Manager applications list to be created.

          ListId -> (string)
              The ID of the Firewall Manager applications list.

          ListName -> (string)

          ListUpdateToken -> (string)
              A unique identifier for each update to the list. When you update
              the  list,  the update token must match the token of the current
              version of the application list. You  can  retrieve  the  update
              token by getting the list.

          CreateTime -> (timestamp)

              ated.

          LastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the Firewall Manager applications  list  was  last
              updated.

              An  array  of  applications in the Firewall Manager applications
              list.

              (structure)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ListId=string,ListName=string,ListUpdateToken=string,CreateTime=timestamp,LastUpdateTime=timestamp,AppsList=[{AppName=string,Protocol=string,Port=long},{AppName=string,Protocol=string,Port=long}],PreviousAppsList={KeyName1=[{AppName=string,Protocol=string,Port=long},{AppName=string,Protocol=string,Port=long}],KeyName2=[{AppName=string,Protocol=string,Port=long},{AppName=string,Protocol=string,Port=long}]}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ListId": "string",
            "ListName": "string",
            "ListUpdateToken": "string",
            "CreateTime": timestamp,
            "LastUpdateTime": timestamp,
            "AppsList": [
              {
                "AppName": "string",
                "Protocol": "string",
                "Port": long
              }
              ...
            ],
            "PreviousAppsList": {"string": [
                  {
                    "AppName": "string",
                    "Protocol": "string",
                    "Port": long
                  }
                  ...
                ]
              ...}
          }

       --tag-list (list)
          The tags associated with the resource.

          (structure)
              A  collection  of  key:value pairs associated with an Amazon Web
              Services resource.  The  key:value  pair  can  be  anything  you
              define.  Typically,  the  tag key represents a category (such as
              "environment") and the tag value  represents  a  specific  value
              within that category (such as "test," "development," or "produc-
              tion"). You can add up to 50 tags to each  Amazon  Web  Services
              resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 Part  of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a
                 tag key to describe a category of information, such as  "cus-
                 tomer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

              Value -> (string)
                 Part  of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a
                 tag value to describe a specific  value  within  a  category,
                 such  as "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values are case-sensi-
                 tive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
