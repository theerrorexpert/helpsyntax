LIST-POLICIES()                                                LIST-POLICIES()



NAME
       list-policies -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns an array of PolicySummary objects.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-policies  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: PolicyList

SYNOPSIS
            list-policies
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve all Firewall Manager policies

       The  following list-policies example retrieves the list of policies for
       the account. In this example, the output is limited to two results  per
       request.  Each  call  returns a NextToken that can be used as the value
       for the --starting-token parameter in the next  list-policies  call  to
       get the next set of results for the list.

          aws fms list-policies \
              --max-items 2

       Output:

          {
              "PolicyList": [

OUTPUT
       PolicyList -> (list)
          An array of PolicySummary objects.

          (structure)
              Details of the Firewall Manager policy.

              PolicyArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the specified policy.

              PolicyId -> (string)
                 The ID of the specified policy.

              PolicyName -> (string)
                 The name of the specified policy.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The  type of resource protected by or in scope of the policy.
                 This is in the  format  shown  in  the  Amazon  Web  Services
                 Resource Types Reference . For WAF and Shield Advanced, exam-
                 ples  include  AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::LoadBalancer  and
                 AWS::CloudFront::Distribution  .  For a security group common
                 policy,  valid  values  are  AWS::EC2::NetworkInterface   and
                 AWS::EC2::Instance  . For a security group content audit pol-
                 icy,   valid    values    are    AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup    ,
                 AWS::EC2::NetworkInterface  ,  and AWS::EC2::Instance . For a
                 security   group   usage   audit   policy,   the   value   is
                 AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup  .  For an Network Firewall policy or
                 DNS Firewall policy, the value is AWS::EC2::VPC .

              SecurityServiceType -> (string)
                 The  service  that  the  policy  is  using  to  protect   the
                 resources. This specifies the type of policy that is created,
                 either an WAF policy, a Shield Advanced policy, or a security
                 group policy.

              RemediationEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  if  the  policy should be automatically applied to
                 new resources.

              DeleteUnusedFMManagedResources -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  Firewall  Manager  should   automatically
                 remove protections from resources that leave the policy scope
                 and clean up resources that Firewall Manager is managing  for
                 accounts when those accounts leave policy scope. For example,
                 Firewall Manager will disassociate a Firewall Manager managed
                 web  ACL from a protected customer resource when the customer
                 resource leaves policy scope.

                 By default, Firewall Manager doesn't  remove  protections  or
                 delete Firewall Manager managed resources.

                 This option is not available for Shield Advanced or WAF Clas-
                 sic policies.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If you have more PolicySummary objects  than  the  number  that  you
          specified  for  MaxResults  in  the request, the response includes a
          NextToken value. To list more PolicySummary objects, submit  another
          ListPolicies  request,  and  specify  the  NextToken  value from the
          response in the NextToken value in the next request.



                                                               LIST-POLICIES()
