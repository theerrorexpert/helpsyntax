LIST-COMPLIANCE-STATUS()                              LIST-COMPLIANCE-STATUS()



NAME
       list-compliance-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  an  array of PolicyComplianceStatus objects. Use PolicyCompli-
       anceStatus to get a summary of which member accounts are  protected  by
       the specified policy.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-compliance-status is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: PolicyComplianceStatusList

SYNOPSIS
            list-compliance-status
          --policy-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --policy-id (string)
          The ID of the Firewall Manager policy that you want the details for.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PolicyComplianceStatusList -> (list)
          An array of PolicyComplianceStatus objects.

          (structure)
              Indicates  whether  the  account is compliant with the specified
              policy. An account is considered  noncompliant  if  it  includes
              resources  that  are  not  protected  by the policy, for WAF and
              Shield Advanced policies, or that are noncompliant with the pol-
              icy, for security group policies.

              PolicyOwner -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web  Services  account that created the Firewall
                 Manager policy.

              PolicyId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Firewall Manager policy.

              PolicyName -> (string)
                 The name of the Firewall Manager policy.

              MemberAccount -> (string)
                 The member account ID.

              EvaluationResults -> (list)
                 An array of EvaluationResult objects.

                 (structure)
                     Describes the  compliance  status  for  the  account.  An
                     account   is   considered  noncompliant  if  it  includes
                     resources that are not protected by the specified  policy
                     or that don't comply with the policy.

                     ComplianceStatus -> (string)
                        Describes  an Amazon Web Services account's compliance
                        with the Firewall Manager policy.

                     ViolatorCount -> (long)
                        The number of resources that are noncompliant with the
                        specified  policy.  For  WAF and Shield Advanced poli-
                        cies, a resource is considered noncompliant if  it  is
                        not  associated  with  the  policy. For security group
                        policies, a resource is considered noncompliant if  it
                        doesn't  comply with the rules of the policy and reme-
                        diation is disabled or not possible.

                     EvaluationLimitExceeded -> (boolean)
                        Indicates that over  100  resources  are  noncompliant
                        with the Firewall Manager policy.

              LastUpdated -> (timestamp)
                 Timestamp of the last update to the EvaluationResult objects.

              IssueInfoMap -> (map)
                 Details about problems with dependent services, such  as  WAF
                 or  Config, and the error message received that indicates the
                 problem with the service.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          If you have more PolicyComplianceStatus objects than the number that
          you specified for MaxResults in the request, the response includes a
          NextToken value. To list more PolicyComplianceStatus objects, submit
          another  ListComplianceStatus  request,  and  specify  the NextToken
          value from the response in the NextToken value in the next  request.
