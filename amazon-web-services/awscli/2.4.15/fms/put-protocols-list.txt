DESCRIPTION

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-protocols-list
          --protocols-list <value>
          [--tag-list <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --protocols-list (structure)
          The details of the Firewall Manager protocols list to be created.

          ListId -> (string)
              The ID of the Firewall Manager protocols list.

          ListName -> (string)
              The name of the Firewall Manager protocols list.

          ListUpdateToken -> (string)
              A unique identifier for each update to the list. When you update
              the list, the update token must match the token of  the  current
              version  of  the  application  list. You can retrieve the update
              token by getting the list.

          CreateTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the Firewall Manager protocols list was created.

          LastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the  Firewall  Manager  protocols  list  was  last
              updated.

          ProtocolsList -> (list)
              An array of protocols in the Firewall Manager protocols list.

              (string)

          PreviousProtocolsList -> (map)
              A  map of previous version numbers to their corresponding proto-
              col arrays.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (list)
                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ListId=string,ListName=string,ListUpdateToken=string,CreateTime=timestamp,LastUpdateTime=timestamp,ProtocolsList=string,string,PreviousProtocolsList={KeyName1=string,string,KeyName2=string,string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ListId": "string",
            "ListName": "string",
            "ListUpdateToken": "string",
            "CreateTime": timestamp,
            "LastUpdateTime": timestamp,
            "ProtocolsList": ["string", ...],
            "PreviousProtocolsList": {"string": ["string", ...]
              ...}
          }

       --tag-list (list)
          The tags associated with the resource.

          (structure)
              A collection of key:value pairs associated with  an  Amazon  Web
              Services  resource.  The  key:value  pair  can  be  anything you
              define. Typically, the tag key represents a  category  (such  as
              "environment")  and  the  tag  value represents a specific value
              within that category (such as "test," "development," or "produc-
              tion").  You  can  add up to 50 tags to each Amazon Web Services
              resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 Part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use  a
                 tag  key to describe a category of information, such as "cus-
                 tomer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

              Value -> (string)
                 Part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use  a
                 tag  value  to  describe  a specific value within a category,
                 such as "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values are  case-sensi-
                 tive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
