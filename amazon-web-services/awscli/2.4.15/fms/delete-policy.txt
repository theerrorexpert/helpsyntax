DELETE-POLICY()                                                DELETE-POLICY()



NAME
       delete-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Permanently deletes an Firewall Manager policy.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-policy
          --policy-id <value>
          [--delete-all-policy-resources | --no-delete-all-policy-resources]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --policy-id (string)
          The  ID of the policy that you want to delete. You can retrieve this
          ID from PutPolicy and ListPolicies .

       --delete-all-policy-resources    |     --no-delete-all-policy-resources
       (boolean)
          If True , the request performs cleanup according to the policy type.

          For WAF and Shield Advanced policies, the cleanup does  the  follow-
          ing:

          o Deletes rule groups created by Firewall Manager

          o Removes web ACLs from in-scope resources

          o Deletes web ACLs that contain no rules or rule groups

          For security group policies, the cleanup does the following for each
          security group in the policy:

          o Disassociates the security group from in-scope resources

          o Deletes the security group if it was created through Firewall Man-
            ager  and  if it's no longer associated with any resources through
            another policy

          After the cleanup, in-scope resources are no longer protected by web
          ACLs  in  this  policy. Protection of out-of-scope resources remains
          unchanged. Scope is determined by tags that you create and  accounts
          that you associate with the policy. When creating the policy, if you
          specify that only resources in specific accounts  or  with  specific
          tags  are  in  scope of the policy, those accounts and resources are
          handled by the policy. All others are out of  scope.  If  you  don't
          specify tags or accounts, all resources are in scope.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a Firewall Manager policy

       The  following delete-policy example removes the policy with the speci-
       fied ID, along with all of its resources.

          aws fms delete-policy \
              --policy-id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111 \
              --delete-all-policy-resources

       This command produces no output.

       the  AWS  WAF,  AWS Firewall Manager, and AWS Shield Advanced Developer
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
