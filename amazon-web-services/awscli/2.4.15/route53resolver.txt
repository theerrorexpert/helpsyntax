ROUTE53RESOLVER()                                            ROUTE53RESOLVER()



NAME
       route53resolver -

DESCRIPTION
       When you create a VPC using Amazon VPC, you automatically get DNS reso-
       lution within the VPC from Route  53  Resolver.  By  default,  Resolver
       answers  DNS  queries for VPC domain names such as domain names for EC2
       instances or Elastic Load Balancing load balancers.  Resolver  performs
       recursive  lookups  against  public  name  servers for all other domain
       names.

       You can also configure DNS resolution between your VPC and your network
       over a Direct Connect or VPN connection:
          Forward  DNS  queries  from  resolvers  on  your network to Route 53
          Resolver

       DNS resolvers on your network can forward DNS queries to Resolver in  a
       specified  VPC. This allows your DNS resolvers to easily resolve domain
       names for Amazon Web  Services  resources  such  as  EC2  instances  or
       records  in  a  Route 53 private hosted zone. For more information, see
       How DNS Resolvers on Your Network  Forward  DNS  Queries  to  Route  53
       Resolver in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .
          Conditionally  forward  queries from a VPC to resolvers on your net-
          work

       You can configure Resolver to forward queries that it receives from EC2
       instances  in  your  VPCs  to DNS resolvers on your network. To forward
       selected queries, you create Resolver rules  that  specify  the  domain
       names  for  the  DNS  queries  that  you want to forward (such as exam-
       ple.com), and the IP addresses of the DNS  resolvers  on  your  network
       that  you  want  to forward the queries to. If a query matches multiple
       rules (example.com, acme.example.com), Resolver chooses the  rule  with
       the  most  specific  match (acme.example.com) and forwards the query to
       the IP addresses that you specified in that rule. For more information,
       see  How  Route 53 Resolver Forwards DNS Queries from Your VPCs to Your
       Network in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

       Like Amazon VPC, Resolver is Regional. In each Region  where  you  have
       VPCs,  you can choose whether to forward queries from your VPCs to your
       network (outbound queries), from your network  to  your  VPCs  (inbound
       queries), or both.
