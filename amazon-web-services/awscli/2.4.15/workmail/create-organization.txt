CREATE-ORGANIZATION()                                    CREATE-ORGANIZATION()



NAME
       create-organization -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a new Amazon WorkMail organization. Optionally, you can choose
       to associate an existing AWS  Directory  Service  directory  with  your
       organization.  If  an  AWS Directory Service directory ID is specified,
       the organization alias must match the directory alias.  If  you  choose
       not  to associate an existing directory with your organization, then we
       create a new Amazon WorkMail directory for you. For  more  information,
       see Adding an organization in the Amazon WorkMail Administrator Guide .

       You can associate multiple email domains with an organization, then set
       your  default  email  domain  from the Amazon WorkMail console. You can
       also associate a domain that is managed in an Amazon  Route  53  public
       hosted zone. For more information, see Adding a domain and Choosing the
       default domain in the Amazon WorkMail Administrator Guide .

       Optionally, you can use a customer managed master key from AWS Key Man-
       agement  Service  (AWS  KMS) to encrypt email for your organization. If
       you don't associate an AWS KMS key, Amazon WorkMail creates  a  default
       AWS managed master key for you.

          [--client-token <value>]
          [--domains <value>]
          [--kms-key-arn <value>]
          [--enable-interoperability | --no-enable-interoperability]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-id (string)
          The AWS Directory Service directory ID.

       --alias (string)
          The organization alias.

       --client-token (string)
          The idempotency token associated with the request.

       --domains (list)
          The email domains to associate with the organization.

          (structure)
              The domain to associate with an Amazon WorkMail organization.

              When  you  configure  a  domain hosted in Amazon Route 53 (Route
              53), all recommended DNS records are added to  the  organization
              when you create it. For more information, see Adding a domain in
              the Amazon WorkMail Administrator Guide .

              DomainName -> (string)
                 The fully qualified domain name.

              HostedZoneId -> (string)
                 The hosted zone ID for a domain hosted in Route 53.  Required
                 when configuring a domain hosted in Route 53.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DomainName=string,HostedZoneId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "DomainName": "string",
              "HostedZoneId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --kms-key-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a customer managed master key from
          AWS KMS.

       --enable-interoperability | --no-enable-interoperability (boolean)
          When true ,  allows  organization  interoperability  between  Amazon
          WorkMail  and  Microsoft  Exchange. Can only be set to true if an AD
          Connector directory ID is included in the request.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       OrganizationId -> (string)
          The organization ID.
