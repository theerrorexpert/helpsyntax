SYNOPSIS
            list-mobile-device-access-overrides
          --organization-id <value>
          [--user-id <value>]
          [--device-id <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --organization-id (string)
          The Amazon WorkMail organization under which to list  mobile  device
          access overrides.

       --user-id (string)
          The  WorkMail  user  under  which  you list the mobile device access
          overrides. Accepts the following types of user identities:

          o User       ID:       12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012       or
            S-1-1-12-1234567890-123456789-123456789-1234

          o Email address: user@domain.tld

          o User name: user

       --device-id (string)
          The mobile device to which the access override applies.

       --next-token (string)
          The  token  to  use  to retrieve the next page of results. The first
          call does not require a token.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return in a single call.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
