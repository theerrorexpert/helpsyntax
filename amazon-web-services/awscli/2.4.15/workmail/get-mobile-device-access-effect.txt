NAME
       get-mobile-device-access-effect -

DESCRIPTION
       Simulates  the  effect  of the mobile device access rules for the given
       attributes of a sample access  event.  Use  this  method  to  test  the
       effects of the current set of mobile device access rules for the Amazon
       WorkMail organization for a particular user's attributes.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-mobile-device-access-effect
          --organization-id <value>
          [--device-type <value>]
          [--device-model <value>]
          [--device-operating-system <value>]
          [--device-user-agent <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --organization-id (string)
          The Amazon WorkMail organization to simulate the access effect  for.

       --device-type (string)
          Device type the simulated user will report.

       --device-model (string)
          Device model the simulated user will report.

       --device-operating-system (string)
          Device operating system the simulated user will report.

       --device-user-agent (string)
          Device user agent the simulated user will report.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Effect -> (string)
          The effect of the simulated access, ALLOW or DENY , after evaluating
          mobile device access rules in the Amazon WorkMail  organization  for
          the simulated user parameters.

       MatchedRules -> (list)
          A  list of the rules which matched the simulated user input and pro-
          duced the effect.

          (structure)
              The rule that a simulated user matches.

              MobileDeviceAccessRuleId -> (string)
                 Identifier of the rule that a simulated user matches.

              Name -> (string)
                 Name of a rule that a simulated user matches.
