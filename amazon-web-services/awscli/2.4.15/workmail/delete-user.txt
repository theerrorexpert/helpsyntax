DELETE-USER()                                                    DELETE-USER()



NAME
       delete-user -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a user from Amazon WorkMail and all subsequent systems. Before
       you can delete a user, the user  state  must  be  DISABLED  .  Use  the
       DescribeUser action to confirm the user state.

       Deleting  a  user  is permanent and cannot be undone. WorkMail archives
       user mailboxes for 30 days before they are permanently removed.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-user
          --organization-id <value>
          --user-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --organization-id (string)
          The organization that contains the user to be deleted.

       --user-id (string)
          The identifier of the user to be deleted.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
