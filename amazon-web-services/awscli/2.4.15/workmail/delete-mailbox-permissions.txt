DESCRIPTION

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-mailbox-permissions
          --organization-id <value>
          --entity-id <value>
          --grantee-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --organization-id (string)
          The  identifier  of the organization under which the member (user or
          group) exists.

       --entity-id (string)
          The identifier of the member (user or group) that owns the  mailbox.

       --grantee-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the  member (user or group) for which to delete
          granted permissions.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       The following delete-mailbox-permissions command deletes  mailbox  per-
       missions  that  were  previously granted to a user or group. The entity
       represents the user that owns the mailbox, and the  grantee  represents
       the user or group for whom to delete permissions.
