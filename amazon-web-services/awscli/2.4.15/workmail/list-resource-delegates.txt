LIST-RESOURCE-DELEGATES()                            LIST-RESOURCE-DELEGATES()



NAME
       list-resource-delegates -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the delegates associated with a resource. Users and groups can be
       resource delegates and answer requests on behalf of the resource.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-resource-delegates is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: Delegates

SYNOPSIS
            list-resource-delegates
          --organization-id <value>
          --resource-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --organization-id (string)
          The  identifier  for the organization that contains the resource for
          which delegates are listed.

       --resource-id (string)
          The identifier for the resource whose delegates are listed.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the delegates for a resource

       The  following  list-resource-delegates command retrieves the delegates
       associated with the specified resource.

          aws workmail list-resource-delegates \
              --organization-id m-d281d0a2fd824be5b6cd3d3ce909fd27 \
              --resource-id r-68bf2d3b1c0244aab7264c24b9217443

       Output:

          {
              "Delegates": [
                  {
                      "Id": "S-1-1-11-1111111111-2222222222-3333333333-3333",
                      "Type": "USER"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Delegates -> (list)
          One page of the resource's delegates.

          (structure)
              The name of the attribute, which is one of the values defined in
              the UserAttribute enumeration.

              Id -> (string)
                 The  identifier  for  the  user  or  group  associated as the
                 resource's delegate.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of the delegate: user or group.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token used to paginate through the delegates associated  with  a
          resource.  While  results  are still available, it has an associated
          value. When the last page is reached, the token is empty.
