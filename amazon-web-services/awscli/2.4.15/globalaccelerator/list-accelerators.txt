LIST-ACCELERATORS()                                        LIST-ACCELERATORS()



NAME
       list-accelerators -

DESCRIPTION
       List the accelerators for an AWS account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-accelerators  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Accelerators

SYNOPSIS
            list-accelerators
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

OUTPUT
       Accelerators -> (list)
          The list of accelerators for a customer account.

          (structure)
              An  accelerator is a complex type that includes one or more lis-
              teners that process inbound connections and then direct  traffic
              to  one  or  more  endpoint  groups, each of which includes end-
              points, such as load balancers.

              AcceleratorArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the accelerator.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the  accelerator.  The  name  must  contain  only
                 alphanumeric characters or hyphens (-), and must not begin or
                 end with a hyphen.

              IpAddressType -> (string)
                 The value for the address type must be IPv4.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the accelerator is enabled.  The  value  is
                 true or false. The default value is true.

                 If  the  value  is  set  to  true,  the accelerator cannot be
                 deleted. If set to false, accelerator can be deleted.

              IpSets -> (list)
                 The static IP addresses that  Global  Accelerator  associates
                 with the accelerator.

                 (structure)
                     A  complex type for the set of IP addresses for an accel-
                     erator.

                     IpFamily -> (string)
                        The types of IP addresses included in this IP set.

                     IpAddresses -> (list)
                        The array of IP addresses in the IP address set. An IP
                        address set can have a maximum of two IP addresses.

                        (string)

              DnsName -> (string)
                 The  Domain  Name  System  (DNS) name that Global Accelerator
                 creates  that  points  to  your   accelerator's   static   IP
                 addresses.

                 The  naming  convention  for the DNS name is the following: A
                 lowercase letter a, followed by a 16-bit random  hex  string,
                 followed    by    .awsglobalaccelerator.com.   For   example:
                 a1234567890abcdef.awsglobalaccelerator.com.

                 For more information about the default DNS name, see  Support
                 for  DNS  Addressing  in Global Accelerator in the AWS Global
                 Accelerator Developer Guide .

              Status -> (string)
                 Describes the deployment status of the accelerator.

              CreatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the accelerator was created.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the accelerator was last modified.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results. You receive this token from a
          previous call.



                                                           LIST-ACCELERATORS()
