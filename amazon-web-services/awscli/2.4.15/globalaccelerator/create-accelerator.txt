CREATE-ACCELERATOR()                                      CREATE-ACCELERATOR()



NAME
       create-accelerator -

DESCRIPTION
       Create  an  accelerator.  An accelerator includes one or more listeners
       that process inbound connections and direct traffic to one or more end-
       point  groups,  each  of which includes endpoints, such as Network Load
       Balancers.

       WARNING:
          Global Accelerator is a global service that  supports  endpoints  in
          multiple  AWS  Regions  but  you  must  specify the US West (Oregon)
          Region to create or update accelerators.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-accelerator
          --name <value>
          [--ip-address-type <value>]
          [--ip-addresses <value>]
          [--enabled | --no-enabled]
          [--idempotency-token <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of an accelerator. The name can have a maximum of 32  char-
          acters,  must  contain  only alphanumeric characters or hyphens (-),
          and must not begin or end with a hyphen.

       --ip-address-type (string)
          The value for the address type must be IPv4.

          Possible values:

          o IPV4

       --ip-addresses (list)
          Optionally, if you've added your  own  IP  address  pool  to  Global
          Accelerator  (BYOIP), you can choose IP addresses from your own pool
          to use for the accelerator's static IP addresses when you create  an
          accelerator.  You  can  specify one or two addresses, separated by a
          space. Do not include the /32 suffix.

          Only one IP address from each of your IP address ranges can be  used
          for  each  accelerator. If you specify only one IP address from your
          IP address range, Global Accelerator  assigns  a  second  static  IP
          address for the accelerator from the AWS IP address pool.

          Note that you can't update IP addresses for an existing accelerator.
          To change them, you must create  a  new  accelerator  with  the  new
          addresses.

          For more information, see Bring Your Own IP Addresses (BYOIP) in the
          AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --enabled | --no-enabled (boolean)
          Indicates whether an accelerator is enabled. The value  is  true  or
          false. The default value is true.

          If  the  value  is set to true, an accelerator cannot be deleted. If
          set to false, the accelerator can be deleted.

       --idempotency-token (string)
          A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to  ensure  the
          idempotencythat is, the uniquenessof an accelerator.

       --tags (list)
          Create tags for an accelerator.

          For  more  information, see Tagging in AWS Global Accelerator in the
          AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide .

          (structure)
              A complex type that contains a Tag key and Tag value.

              Key -> (string)
                 A string that contains a Tag key.

              Value -> (string)
                 A string that contains a Tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create an accelerator

       The following create-accelerator example creates  an  accelerator  with
       two  tags  with  two  BYOIP  static  IP addresses. You must specify the
       US-West-2 (Oregon) Region to create or update an accelerator.

          aws globalaccelerator create-accelerator \
              --name ExampleAccelerator \
              --tags Key="Name",Value="Example Name" Key="Project",Value="Example Project" \
              --ip-addresses 192.0.2.250 198.51.100.52

       Output:

          {
              "Accelerator": {
                  "AcceleratorArn": "arn:aws:globalaccelerator::012345678901:accelerator/1234abcd-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcdefgh",

                          ],
                          "IpFamily": "IPv4"
                      }
