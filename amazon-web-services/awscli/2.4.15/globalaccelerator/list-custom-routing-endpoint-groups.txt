NAME
       list-custom-routing-endpoint-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       List the endpoint groups that are associated with a listener for a cus-
       tom routing accelerator.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-custom-routing-endpoint-groups
          --listener-arn <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --listener-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  listener  to  list  endpoint
          groups for.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  number  of  endpoint group objects that you want to return with
          this call. The default value is 10.

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next set of results. You receive this token from a
          previous call.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EndpointGroups -> (list)
          The list of the endpoint groups associated with  a  listener  for  a
          custom routing accelerator.

          (structure)
              A  complex  type  for  the  endpoint  group for a custom routing
              accelerator. An AWS Region can have only one endpoint group  for
              a specific listener.

              EndpointGroupArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint group.

              EndpointGroupRegion -> (string)
                 The AWS Region where the endpoint group is located.

              DestinationDescriptions -> (list)
                 For  a  custom  routing accelerator, describes the port range
                 and protocol for all endpoints (virtual  private  cloud  sub-
                 nets) in an endpoint group to accept client traffic on.

                 (structure)
                     For  a  custom  routing  accelerator,  describes the port
                     range and protocol for  all  endpoints  (virtual  private
                     cloud  subnets)  in  an  endpoint  group to accept client
                     traffic on.

                     FromPort -> (integer)
                        The first port, inclusive, in the range of  ports  for
                        the  endpoint  group  that is associated with a custom
                        routing accelerator.

                     ToPort -> (integer)
                        The last port, inclusive, in the range  of  ports  for
                        the  endpoint  group  that is associated with a custom
                        routing accelerator.

                     Protocols -> (list)
                        The protocol for the endpoint group that is associated
                        with a custom routing accelerator. The protocol can be
                        either TCP or UDP.

                        (string)

              EndpointDescriptions -> (list)
                 For a custom routing  accelerator,  describes  the  endpoints
                 (virtual  private  cloud  subnets)  in  an  endpoint group to
                 accept client traffic on.

                 (structure)
                     A complex type for  an  endpoint  for  a  custom  routing
                     accelerator.  Each endpoint group can include one or more
                     endpoints, which are virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets.

                     EndpointId -> (string)
                        An  ID  for the endpoint. For custom routing accelera-
                        tors, this is the virtual private cloud  (VPC)  subnet
                        ID.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results. You receive this token from a
          previous call.
