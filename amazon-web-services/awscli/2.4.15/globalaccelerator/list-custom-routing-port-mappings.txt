NAME
       list-custom-routing-port-mappings -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  a complete mapping from the public accelerator IP address and
       port to destination EC2 instance IP addresses and ports in the  virtual
       public  cloud  (VPC)  subnet endpoint for a custom routing accelerator.
       For each subnet endpoint that you add, Global Accelerator creates a new
       static port mapping for the accelerator. The port mappings don't change
       after Global Accelerator generates them, so you can retrieve and  cache
       the full mapping on your servers.

       If  you  remove  a  subnet  from  your  accelerator, Global Accelerator
       removes (reclaims) the port mappings. If  you  add  a  subnet  to  your
       accelerator, Global Accelerator creates new port mappings (the existing
       ones don't change). If you add or remove EC2 instances in your  subnet,
       the  port  mappings don't change, because the mappings are created when
       you add the subnet to Global Accelerator.

       The mappings also include a flag for each  destination  denoting  which
       destination IP addresses and ports are allowed or denied traffic.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-custom-routing-port-mappings  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: PortMappings

SYNOPSIS
            list-custom-routing-port-mappings
          --accelerator-arn <value>
          [--endpoint-group-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --accelerator-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the accelerator to list the custom
          routing port mappings for.

       --endpoint-group-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the endpoint group to list the
          custom routing port mappings for.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       The following list-custom-routing-port-mappings example provides a par-
       tial list of the port mappings in a custom routing accelerator.

OUTPUT
       PortMappings -> (list)
          The port mappings for a custom routing accelerator.

          (structure)
              Returns  the ports and associated IP addresses and ports of Ama-
              zon EC2 instances in your virtual private cloud  (VPC)  subnets.
              Custom routing is a port mapping protocol in AWS Global Acceler-
              ator that statically associates port ranges  with  VPC  subnets,
              which  allows  Global Accelerator to route to specific instances
              and ports within one or more subnets.

              AcceleratorPort -> (integer)
                 The accelerator port.

              EndpointGroupArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint group.

              EndpointId -> (string)
                 The IP address of the VPC subnet (the subnet ID).

              DestinationSocketAddress -> (structure)
                 The EC2 instance IP address and port number  in  the  virtual
                 private cloud (VPC) subnet.

                 IpAddress -> (string)
                     The IP address for the socket address.

                 Port -> (integer)
                     The port for the socket address.

              Protocols -> (list)
                 The protocols supported by the endpoint group.

                 (string)

              DestinationTrafficState -> (string)
                 Indicates  whether  or  not  a  port  mapping destination can
                 receive traffic. The value is either  ALLOW,  if  traffic  is
                 allowed  to  the  destination,  or  DENY,  if  traffic is not
                 allowed to the destination.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results. You receive this token from a
          previous call.
