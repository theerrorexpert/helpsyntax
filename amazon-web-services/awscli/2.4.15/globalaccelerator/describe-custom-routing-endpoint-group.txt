NAME
       describe-custom-routing-endpoint-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Describe an endpoint group for a custom routing accelerator.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-custom-routing-endpoint-group
          --endpoint-group-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --endpoint-group-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint group to describe.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe an endpoint group for a custom routing accelerator

       The  following describe-custom-routing-endpoint-group example describes
       an endpoint group for a custom routing accelerator.

          aws globalaccelerator describe-custom-routing-endpoint-group \
              --endpoint-group-arn arn:aws:globalaccelerator::012345678901:accelerator/1234abcd-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcdefgh/listener/6789vxyz/endpoint-group/ab88888example

       Output:

          {
              "EndpointGroup": {
                  "EndpointGroupArn": "arn:aws:globalaccelerator::012345678901:accelerator/1234abcd-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcdefgh/listener/6789vxyz/endpoint-group/ab88888example",

                          "EndpointId": "subnet-1234567890abcdef0"
                      }
                  ]
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       EndpointGroup -> (structure)
          The description of an endpoint group for a custom routing  accelera-
          tor.

          EndpointGroupArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint group.

          EndpointGroupRegion -> (string)
              The AWS Region where the endpoint group is located.

          DestinationDescriptions -> (list)
              For  a  custom routing accelerator, describes the port range and
              protocol for all endpoints (virtual private cloud subnets) in an
              endpoint group to accept client traffic on.

              (structure)
                 For  a  custom  routing accelerator, describes the port range
                 and protocol for all endpoints (virtual  private  cloud  sub-
                 nets) in an endpoint group to accept client traffic on.

                 FromPort -> (integer)
                     The  first port, inclusive, in the range of ports for the
                     endpoint group that is associated with a  custom  routing
                     accelerator.

                 ToPort -> (integer)
                     The  last  port, inclusive, in the range of ports for the
                     endpoint group that is associated with a  custom  routing
                     accelerator.

                 Protocols -> (list)
                     The  protocol  for  the endpoint group that is associated
                     with a custom routing accelerator. The  protocol  can  be
                     either TCP or UDP.

                     (string)

          EndpointDescriptions -> (list)
              For  a custom routing accelerator, describes the endpoints (vir-
              tual private cloud subnets)  in  an  endpoint  group  to  accept
              client traffic on.

              (structure)
                 A complex type for an endpoint for a custom routing accelera-
                 tor. Each endpoint group can include one or  more  endpoints,
                 which are virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets.

                 EndpointId -> (string)
                     An  ID for the endpoint. For custom routing accelerators,
                     this is the virtual private cloud (VPC) subnet ID.
