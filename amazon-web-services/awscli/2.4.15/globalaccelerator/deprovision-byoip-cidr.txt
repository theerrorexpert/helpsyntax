DEPROVISION-BYOIP-CIDR()                              DEPROVISION-BYOIP-CIDR()



NAME
       deprovision-byoip-cidr -

DESCRIPTION
       Releases  the  specified address range that you provisioned to use with
       your AWS resources through bring your  own  IP  addresses  (BYOIP)  and
       deletes the corresponding address pool.

       Before  you  can release an address range, you must stop advertising it
       by using WithdrawByoipCidr and you must not have any accelerators  that
       are using static IP addresses allocated from its address range.

       For  more  information,  see Bring Your Own IP Addresses (BYOIP) in the
       AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            deprovision-byoip-cidr
          --cidr <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cidr (string)
          The address range, in CIDR notation. The prefix  must  be  the  same
          prefix that you specified when you provisioned the address range.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To deprovision an address range

       The  following  deprovision-byoip-cidr  example  releases the specified
       address range that you provisioned to use with your AWS resources.

          aws globalaccelerator deprovision-byoip-cidr \
              --cidr "198.51.100.0/24"

       Output:

          {
              "ByoipCidr": {
                  "Cidr": "198.51.100.0/24",
                  "State": "PENDING_DEPROVISIONING"
              }
          }

       Accelerator in the AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       ByoipCidr -> (structure)
          Information about the address range.

          Cidr -> (string)
              The address range, in CIDR notation.

          State -> (string)

          Events -> (list)
              A  history  of  status  changes for an IP address range that you
              bring to AWS  Global  Accelerator  through  bring  your  own  IP
              address (BYOIP).

              (structure)
                 A  complex type that contains a Message and a Timestamp value
                 for changes that you make in the status an IP  address  range
                 that  you  bring to AWS Global Accelerator through bring your
                 own IP address (BYOIP).

                 Message -> (string)
                     A  string  that  contains  an  Event  message  describing

                     range that you bring to AWS  Global  Accelerator  through
                     bring your own IP address (BYOIP).

                 Timestamp -> (timestamp)

                     through bring your own IP address (BYOIP).
