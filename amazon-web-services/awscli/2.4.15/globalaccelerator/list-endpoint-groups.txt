LIST-ENDPOINT-GROUPS()                                  LIST-ENDPOINT-GROUPS()



NAME
       list-endpoint-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       List the endpoint groups that are associated with a listener.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-endpoint-groups  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: EndpointGroups

SYNOPSIS
            list-endpoint-groups
          --listener-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --listener-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the listener.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list endpoint groups

       The  following  list-endpoint-groups  example lists the endpoint groups
       for a listener. This listener has two endpoint groups.

OUTPUT
       EndpointGroups -> (list)
          The list of the endpoint groups associated with a listener.

          (structure)
              A  complex  type  for the endpoint group. An AWS Region can have
              only one endpoint group for a specific listener.

              EndpointGroupArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint group.

              EndpointGroupRegion -> (string)
                 The AWS Region where the endpoint group is located.

              EndpointDescriptions -> (list)
                 The list of endpoint objects.

                 (structure)
                     A complex type for an endpoint. Each endpoint  group  can
                     include one or more endpoints, such as load balancers.

                     EndpointId -> (string)
                        An  ID  for the endpoint. If the endpoint is a Network
                        Load Balancer or Application Load  Balancer,  this  is
                        the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource. If the
                        endpoint is an Elastic IP address, this is the Elastic
                        IP  address  allocation  ID. For Amazon EC2 instances,
                        this is the EC2 instance ID.

                        An Application Load Balancer can be either internal or
                        internet-facing.

                     Weight -> (integer)
                        The  weight associated with the endpoint. When you add
                        weights to endpoints, you configure AWS Global  Accel-
                        erator  to route traffic based on proportions that you
                        specify.  For  example,  you  might  specify  endpoint
                        weights of 4, 5, 5, and 6 (sum=20). The result is that
                        4/20 of your traffic, on average,  is  routed  to  the
                        first  endpoint, 5/20 is routed both to the second and
                        third endpoints, and 6/20 is routed to the  last  end-
                        point.  For  more information, see Endpoint Weights in
                        the AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide .

                     HealthState -> (string)
                        The health status of the endpoint.

                     HealthReason -> (string)
                        Returns a null result.

                     ClientIPPreservationEnabled -> (boolean)
                        Indicates whether client IP  address  preservation  is
                        enabled for an Application Load Balancer endpoint. The
                        value is true or false. The default value is true  for
                        new accelerators.

                        If  the  value is set to true, the client's IP address
                        is preserved in the X-Forwarded-For request header  as
                        traffic  travels  to  applications  on the Application
                        Load Balancer endpoint fronted by the accelerator.

                        For more information, see Viewing Client IP  Addresses
                        in  AWS Global Accelerator in the AWS Global Accelera-
                        tor Developer Guide .

              TrafficDialPercentage -> (float)
                 The percentage of traffic to send to  an  AWS  Region.  Addi-
                 tional  traffic  is  distributed to other endpoint groups for
                 this listener.

                 Use this action to increase (dial up) or decrease (dial down)
                 traffic  to  a  specific Region. The percentage is applied to
                 the traffic that would otherwise  have  been  routed  to  the
                 Region based on optimal routing.

                 The default value is 100.

              HealthCheckPort -> (integer)
                 The  port  that  Global  Accelerator  uses  to perform health
                 checks on endpoints that are part of this endpoint group.

                 The default port is the port for the listener that this  end-
                 point  group  is  associated  with. If the listener port is a
                 list, Global Accelerator uses the first specified port in the
                 list of ports.

              HealthCheckProtocol -> (string)
                 The  protocol  that Global Accelerator uses to perform health
                 checks on endpoints that are part of this endpoint group. The
                 default value is TCP.

              HealthCheckPath -> (string)
                 If  the protocol is HTTP/S, then this value provides the ping
                 path that Global Accelerator uses for the destination on  the
                 endpoints for health checks. The default is slash (/).

              HealthCheckIntervalSeconds -> (integer)
                 The  time10  seconds  or  30 secondsbetween health checks for
                 each endpoint. The default value is 30.

              ThresholdCount -> (integer)
                 The number of consecutive health checks required to  set  the
                 state  of  a  healthy  endpoint  to  unhealthy,  or to set an
                 unhealthy endpoint to healthy. The default value is 3.

              PortOverrides -> (list)
                 Allows you to override the destination ports  used  to  route
                 traffic to an endpoint. Using a port override lets you to map
                 a list of external destination ports (that  your  users  send
                 traffic  to) to a list of internal destination ports that you
                 want an application endpoint to receive traffic on.

                 (structure)
                     Override specific listener ports used to route traffic to
                     endpoints  that  are part of an endpoint group. For exam-
                     ple, you can create a port override in which the listener
                     receives  user  traffic  on  ports  80  and 443, but your
                     accelerator routes that traffic to ports 1080  and  1443,
                     respectively, on the endpoints.

                     For  more  information,  see  Port  overrides  in the AWS
                     Global Accelerator Developer Guide .

                     ListenerPort -> (integer)
                        The listener port that you want to map to  a  specific
                        endpoint  port.  This  is  the  port that user traffic
                        arrives to the Global Accelerator on.

                     EndpointPort -> (integer)
                        The endpoint port that you want a listener port to  be
                        mapped  to.  This is the port on the endpoint, such as
                        the Application Load Balancer or Amazon EC2  instance.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results. You receive this token from a
          previous call.
