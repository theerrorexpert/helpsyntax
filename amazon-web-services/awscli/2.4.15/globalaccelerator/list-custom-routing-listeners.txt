LIST-CUSTOM-ROUTING-LISTENERS()                LIST-CUSTOM-ROUTING-LISTENERS()



NAME
       list-custom-routing-listeners -

DESCRIPTION
       List the listeners for a custom routing accelerator.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-custom-routing-listeners  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: Listeners

SYNOPSIS
            list-custom-routing-listeners
          --accelerator-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --accelerator-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the accelerator to list  listeners
          for.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list listeners for custom routing accelerators

       The following list-custom-routing-listeners example lists the listeners
       for a custom routing accelerator.

          aws globalaccelerator list-custom-routing-listeners \
              --accelerator-arn arn:aws:globalaccelerator::012345678901:accelerator/1234abcd-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcdefgh

       Output:

          {
              "Listeners": [
                  {
                      "ListenerArn": "arn:aws:globalaccelerator::012345678901:accelerator/1234abcd-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcdefgh/listener/abcdef1234",
                      "PortRanges": [
                          {
                              "FromPort": 5000,
                              "ToPort": 10000
                          }
                      ],
                      "Protocol": "TCP"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Listeners -> (list)
          The list of listeners for a custom routing accelerator.

          (structure)
              A complex type for a listener for a custom routing  accelerator.

              ListenerArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the listener.

              PortRanges -> (list)
                 The  port  range  to  support for connections from clients to
                 your accelerator.

                 Separately, you set  port  ranges  for  endpoints.  For  more
                 information, see About endpoints for custom routing accelera-
                 tors .

                 (structure)
                     A complex type for a range of ports for a listener.

                     FromPort -> (integer)
                        The first port in the range of ports, inclusive.

                     ToPort -> (integer)
                        The last port in the range of ports, inclusive.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results. You receive this token from a
          previous call.
