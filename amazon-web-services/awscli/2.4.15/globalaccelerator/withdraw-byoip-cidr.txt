WITHDRAW-BYOIP-CIDR()                                    WITHDRAW-BYOIP-CIDR()



NAME
       withdraw-byoip-cidr -

DESCRIPTION
       Stops  advertising  an  address range that is provisioned as an address
       pool. You can perform this operation at most  once  every  10  seconds,
       even if you specify different address ranges each time.

       It  can  take  a  few minutes before traffic to the specified addresses
       stops routing to AWS because of propagation delays.

       For more information, see Bring Your Own IP Addresses  (BYOIP)  in  the
       AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            withdraw-byoip-cidr
          --cidr <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cidr (string)
          The address range, in CIDR notation.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To withdraw an address range

       The  following  withdraw-byoip-cidr  example withdraws an address range
       from AWS Global Accelerator that you previously advertised for use with
       your AWS resources.

          aws globalaccelerator withdraw-byoip-cidr \
              --cidr 192.0.2.250/24

       Output:

          {
              "ByoipCidr": {
                  "Cidr": "192.0.2.250/24",
                  "State": "PENDING_WITHDRAWING"
              }
          }

       Accelerator in the AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide.
