NAME
       provision-byoip-cidr -

DESCRIPTION
       Provisions  an  IP address range to use with your AWS resources through
       bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP) and creates a corresponding address
       pool.  After the address range is provisioned, it is ready to be adver-
       tised using AdvertiseByoipCidr .

       For more information, see Bring Your Own IP Addresses  (BYOIP)  in  the
       AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            provision-byoip-cidr
          --cidr <value>
          --cidr-authorization-context <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cidr (string)
          The  public  IPv4 address range, in CIDR notation. The most specific
          IP prefix that you can specify is  /24.  The  address  range  cannot
          overlap  with  another  address range that you've brought to this or
          another Region.

       --cidr-authorization-context (structure)
          A signed document that proves that you are authorized to  bring  the
          specified IP address range to Amazon using BYOIP.

          Message -> (string)
              The plain-text authorization message for the prefix and account.

          Signature -> (string)
              The signed authorization message for the prefix and account.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Message=string,Signature=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Message": "string",
            "Signature": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To provision an address range

       The following provision-byoip-cidr  example  provisions  the  specified
       address range to use with your AWS resources.

          aws globalaccelerator provision-byoip-cidr \
              --cidr 192.0.2.250/24 \
              --cidr-authorization-context Message="$text_message",Signature="$signed_message"

       Output:

          {
              "ByoipCidr": {
                  "Cidr": "192.0.2.250/24",
                  "State": "PENDING_PROVISIONING"
              }
          }

       Accelerator in the AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       ByoipCidr -> (structure)
          Information about the address range.

          Cidr -> (string)
              The address range, in CIDR notation.

          State -> (string)
              The state of the address pool.

          Events -> (list)
              A history of status changes for an IP  address  range  that  you
              bring  to  AWS  Global  Accelerator  through  bring  your own IP
              address (BYOIP).

              (structure)
                 A complex type that contains a Message and a Timestamp  value
                 for  changes  that you make in the status an IP address range
                 that you bring to AWS Global Accelerator through  bring  your
                 own IP address (BYOIP).

                 Message -> (string)
                     A  string  that  contains  an  Event  message  describing
                     changes that you make in the  status  of  an  IP  address
                     range  that  you  bring to AWS Global Accelerator through
                     bring your own IP address (BYOIP).

                 Timestamp -> (timestamp)
                     A timestamp when you make  a  status  change  for  an  IP
                     address  range  that  you bring to AWS Global Accelerator
                     through bring your own IP address (BYOIP).
