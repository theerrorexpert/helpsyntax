DELETE-ACCELERATOR()                                      DELETE-ACCELERATOR()



NAME
       delete-accelerator -

DESCRIPTION
       Delete  an  accelerator. Before you can delete an accelerator, you must
       disable it and remove all dependent resources (listeners  and  endpoint
       groups).  To  disable  the  accelerator,  update the accelerator to set
       Enabled to false.

       WARNING:
          When you create an accelerator, by default, Global Accelerator  pro-
          vides  you with a set of two static IP addresses. Alternatively, you
          can bring your own IP  address  ranges  to  Global  Accelerator  and
          assign IP addresses from those ranges.

          The  IP addresses are assigned to your accelerator for as long as it
          exists, even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts
          or routes traffic. However, when you delete an accelerator, you lose
          the static IP addresses that are assigned to the accelerator, so you
          can  no  longer  route  traffic  by  using them. As a best practice,
          ensure that you have permissions in  place  to  avoid  inadvertently
          deleting accelerators. You can use IAM policies with Global Acceler-
          ator to limit the users who have permissions to delete an  accelera-
          tor.  For more information, see Authentication and Access Control in
          the AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            delete-accelerator
          --accelerator-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --accelerator-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an accelerator.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
