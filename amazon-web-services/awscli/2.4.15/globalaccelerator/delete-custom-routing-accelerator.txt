NAME
       delete-custom-routing-accelerator -

DESCRIPTION
       Delete a custom routing accelerator. Before you can delete an accelera-
       tor, you must disable it and remove all dependent resources  (listeners
       and  endpoint groups). To disable the accelerator, update the accelera-
       tor to set Enabled to false.

       WARNING:
          When you create a custom routing  accelerator,  by  default,  Global
          Accelerator provides you with a set of two static IP addresses.

          The  IP addresses are assigned to your accelerator for as long as it
          exists, even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts
          or routes traffic. However, when you delete an accelerator, you lose
          the static IP addresses that are assigned to the accelerator, so you
          can  no  longer  route  traffic  by  using them. As a best practice,
          ensure that you have permissions in  place  to  avoid  inadvertently
          deleting accelerators. You can use IAM policies with Global Acceler-
          ator to limit the users who have permissions to delete an  accelera-
          tor.  For more information, see Authentication and Access Control in
          the AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            delete-custom-routing-accelerator
          --accelerator-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --accelerator-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the custom routing accelerator  to
          delete.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
