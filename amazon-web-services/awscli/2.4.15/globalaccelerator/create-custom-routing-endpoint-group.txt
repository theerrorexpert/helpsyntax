NAME
       create-custom-routing-endpoint-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Create  an endpoint group for the specified listener for a custom rout-
       ing accelerator. An endpoint group is a collection of endpoints in  one
       AWS Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-custom-routing-endpoint-group
          --listener-arn <value>
          --endpoint-group-region <value>
          --destination-configurations <value>
          [--idempotency-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --listener-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the listener for a custom routing
          endpoint.

       --endpoint-group-region (string)
          The AWS Region where the endpoint group is located. A  listener  can
          have only one endpoint group in a specific Region.

       --destination-configurations (list)
          Sets  the port range and protocol for all endpoints (virtual private
          cloud subnets) in a custom routing endpoint group to  accept  client
          traffic on.

          (structure)
              For a custom routing accelerator, sets the port range and proto-
              col for all endpoints (virtual private cloud subnets) in an end-
              point group to accept client traffic on.

              FromPort -> (integer)
                 The first port, inclusive, in the range of ports for the end-
                 point group that is associated with a custom routing acceler-
                 ator.

              ToPort -> (integer)
                 The  last port, inclusive, in the range of ports for the end-
                 point group that is associated with a custom routing acceler-
                 ator.

              Protocols -> (list)
                 The protocol for the endpoint group that is associated with a
                 custom routing accelerator. The protocol can be either TCP or
                 UDP.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FromPort=integer,ToPort=integer,Protocols=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "FromPort": integer,
              "ToPort": integer,
              "Protocols": ["TCP"|"UDP", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --idempotency-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotencythat is, the uniquenessof the request.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create an endpoint group for a custom routing accelerator

       The following create-custom-routing-endpoint-group example  creates  an
       endpoint group for a custom routing accelerator.

          aws globalaccelerator create-custom-routing-endpoint-group \
              --listener-arn arn:aws:globalaccelerator::012345678901:accelerator/1234abcd-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcdefgh/listener/0123vxyz \
              --endpoint-group-region us-east-2 \
              --destination-configurations "FromPort=80,ToPort=81,Protocols=TCP,UDP"

       Output:

          {
              "EndpointGroup": {
                  "EndpointGroupArn": "arn:aws:globalaccelerator::012345678901:accelerator/1234abcd-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcdefgh/listener/0123vxyz/endpoint-group/4321abcd",
                  "EndpointGroupRegion": "us-east-2",
                  "DestinationDescriptions": [
                      {
                          "FromPort": 80,
                          "ToPort": 81,
                          "Protocols": [

                  "EndpointDescriptions": []
              }
          }
