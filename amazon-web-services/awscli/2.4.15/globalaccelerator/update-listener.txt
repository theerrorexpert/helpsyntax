DESCRIPTION
       Update a listener.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-listener
          --listener-arn <value>
          [--port-ranges <value>]
          [--protocol <value>]
          [--client-affinity <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --listener-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the listener to update.

       --port-ranges (list)
          The  updated list of port ranges for the connections from clients to
          the accelerator.

          (structure)
              A complex type for a range of ports for a listener.

              FromPort -> (integer)
                 The first port in the range of ports, inclusive.

              ToPort -> (integer)
                 The last port in the range of ports, inclusive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FromPort=integer,ToPort=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "FromPort": integer,
              "ToPort": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --protocol (string)
          The updated protocol for the connections from clients to the  accel-
          erator.

          Possible values:

          o TCP

          o UDP

       --client-affinity (string)
          Client affinity lets you direct all requests from a user to the same
          endpoint, if you have stateful applications, regardless of the  port
          and  protocol  of the client request. Client affinity gives you con-
          trol over whether to always route each client to the  same  specific
          endpoint.

          AWS  Global  Accelerator uses a consistent-flow hashing algorithm to
          choose the optimal endpoint for a connection. If client affinity  is
          NONE  ,  Global  Accelerator uses the "five-tuple" (5-tuple) proper-
          tiessource IP address, source port, destination IP address, destina-
          tion  port,  and  protocolto select the hash value, and then chooses
          the best endpoint. However, with this setting, if someone uses  dif-
          ferent  ports  to  connect  to Global Accelerator, their connections
          might not be always routed to the same  endpoint  because  the  hash
          value changes.

          If you want a given client to always be routed to the same endpoint,
          set client affinity to SOURCE_IP instead. When you use the SOURCE_IP
          setting,  Global  Accelerator uses the "two-tuple" (2-tuple) proper-
          ties source (client) IP address and destination IP addressto  select
          the hash value.

          The default value is NONE .

          Possible values:

          o NONE

          o SOURCE_IP

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update a listener

       The  following update-listener example updates a listener to change the
       port to 100.

          aws globalaccelerator update-listener \
              --listener-arn arn:aws:globalaccelerator::012345678901:accelerator/1234abcd-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcdefgh/listener/0123vxyz \
              --port-ranges FromPort=100,ToPort=100

       Output:

          {
              "Listener": {
                  "ListenerArn": "arn:aws:globalaccelerator::012345678901:accelerator/1234abcd-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcdefgh/listener/0123vxyz
                  "PortRanges": [
                      {
                          "FromPort": 100,
                          "ToPort": 100
                      }
                  ],
                  "Protocol": "TCP",
                  "ClientAffinity": "NONE"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       Listener -> (structure)
          Information for the updated listener.

          ListenerArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the listener.

          PortRanges -> (list)
              The  list of port ranges for the connections from clients to the
              accelerator.

              (structure)
                 A complex type for a range of ports for a listener.

                 FromPort -> (integer)
                     The first port in the range of ports, inclusive.

                 ToPort -> (integer)
                     The last port in the range of ports, inclusive.

          Protocol -> (string)
              The protocol for the connections from clients to  the  accelera-
              tor.

          ClientAffinity -> (string)
              Client  affinity lets you direct all requests from a user to the
              same endpoint, if you have stateful applications, regardless  of
              the  port  and  protocol  of the client request. Client affinity
              gives you control over whether to always route  each  client  to
              the same specific endpoint.

              AWS  Global Accelerator uses a consistent-flow hashing algorithm
              to choose the optimal  endpoint  for  a  connection.  If  client
              affinity  is  NONE  ,  Global  Accelerator uses the "five-tuple"
              (5-tuple) propertiessource IP address, source port,  destination
              IP  address,  destination  port,  and protocolto select the hash
              value, and then chooses the best endpoint.  However,  with  this
              setting,  if  someone  uses different ports to connect to Global
              Accelerator, their connections might not be always routed to the
              same endpoint because the hash value changes.

              If  you want a given client to always be routed to the same end-
              point, set client affinity to SOURCE_IP instead.  When  you  use
              the  SOURCE_IP  setting, Global Accelerator uses the "two-tuple"
              (2-tuple) properties source (client) IP address and  destination
              IP addressto select the hash value.

              The default value is NONE .
