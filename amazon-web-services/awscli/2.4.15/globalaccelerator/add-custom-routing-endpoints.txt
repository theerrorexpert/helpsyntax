ADD-CUSTOM-ROUTING-ENDPOINTS()                  ADD-CUSTOM-ROUTING-ENDPOINTS()



NAME
       add-custom-routing-endpoints -

DESCRIPTION
       Associate  a virtual private cloud (VPC) subnet endpoint with your cus-
       tom routing accelerator.

       The listener port range must be large enough to support the  number  of
       IP  addresses that can be specified in your subnet. The number of ports
       required is: subnet size times the number of ports per destination  EC2
       instances.  For  example,  a  subnet defined as /24 requires a listener
       port range of at least 255 ports.

       Note: You must have enough remaining listener ports available to map to
       the  subnet ports, or the call will fail with a LimitExceededException.

       By default, all destinations in a subnet in a custom routing  accelera-
       tor cannot receive traffic. To enable all destinations to receive traf-
       fic, or to specify individual port mappings that can  receive  traffic,
       see the AllowCustomRoutingTraffic operation.

SYNOPSIS
            add-custom-routing-endpoints
          --endpoint-configurations <value>
          --endpoint-group-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --endpoint-configurations (list)
          The list of endpoint objects to add to a custom routing accelerator.

          (structure)
              The list of endpoint objects. For custom routing, this is a list
              of virtual private cloud (VPC) subnet IDs.

              EndpointId -> (string)
                 An ID for the endpoint. For custom routing accelerators, this
                 is the virtual private cloud (VPC) subnet ID.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          EndpointId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "EndpointId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --endpoint-group-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint group for the  custom
          routing endpoint.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To  add a VPC subnet endpoint to an endpoint group for a custom routing
       accelerator

       The following add-custom-routing-endpoints example adds  a  VPC  subnet
       endpoint to an endpoint group for a custom routing accelerator.

          aws globalaccelerator add-custom-routing-endpoints \
              --endpoint-group-arn arn:aws:globalaccelerator::012345678901:accelerator/1234abcd-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcdefgh/listener/0123vxyz/endpoint-group/4321abcd \
              --endpoint-configurations "EndpointId=subnet-1234567890abcdef0"

       Output:

          {
              "EndpointDescriptions": [
                  {
                      "EndpointId": "subnet-1234567890abcdef0"
                  }
              ],
              "EndpointGroupArn":"arn:aws:globalaccelerator::012345678901:accelerator/1234abcd-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcdefgh/listener/0123vxyz/endpoint-group/4321abcd"
          }

       accelerators in AWS Global Accelerator in the  AWS  Global  Accelerator
       Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       EndpointDescriptions -> (list)
          The endpoint objects added to the custom routing accelerator.

          (structure)
              A complex type for an endpoint for a custom routing accelerator.
              Each endpoint group can include one or more endpoints, which are
              virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets.

              EndpointId -> (string)
                 An ID for the endpoint. For custom routing accelerators, this
                 is the virtual private cloud (VPC) subnet ID.

       EndpointGroupArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint group for the  custom
          routing endpoint.
