NAME
       get-infrastructure-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets an infrastructure configuration.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-infrastructure-configuration
          --infrastructure-configuration-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --infrastructure-configuration-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the infrastructure configuration
          that you want to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get infrastructure configuration details

       The  following  get-infrastructure-configuration  example   lists   the
       details of an infrastructure configuration by specifying its ARN.

          aws imagebuilder get-infrastructure-configuration \
              --infrastructure-configuration-arn arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-west-2:123456789012:infrastructure-configuration/myexampleinfrastructure

                 o required   When you retrieve the IAM role credentials, ver-
                   sion 2.0 credentials are returned in all cases.

                 o optional  You can include a signed  token  header  in  your
                   request  to retrieve instance metadata, or you can leave it
                   out.  If  you  include  it,  version  2.0  credentials  are
                   returned  for  the IAM role. Otherwise, version 1.0 creden-
                   tials are returned.
