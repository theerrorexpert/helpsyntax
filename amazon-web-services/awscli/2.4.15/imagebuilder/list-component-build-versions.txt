LIST-COMPONENT-BUILD-VERSIONS()                LIST-COMPONENT-BUILD-VERSIONS()



NAME
       list-component-build-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the list of component build versions for the specified semantic
       version.

       NOTE:
          The       semantic       version       has        four        nodes:
          <major>.<minor>.<patch>/<build>. You can assign values for the first
          three, and can filter on all of them.
              Filtering: With semantic versioning, you have the flexibility to
              use  wildcards  (x) to specify the most recent versions or nodes
              when selecting the base image or  components  for  your  recipe.
              When  you  use a wildcard in any node, all nodes to the right of
              the first wildcard must also be wildcards.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-component-build-versions
          --component-version-arn <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --component-version-arn (string)
          The component version Amazon Resource Name (ARN) whose versions  you
          want to list.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum items to return in a request.

       --next-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list component build versions

       The following list-component-build-versions example lists the component
       build versions with a specific semantic version.

          aws imagebuilder list-component-build-versions --component-version-arn arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-west-2:123456789012:component/myexamplecomponent/2019.12.02

       Output:

          {
              "requestId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
              "componentSummaryList": [

                      "arn": "arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-west-2:123456789012:component/myexamplecomponent/2019.12.02/1",

                      "description": "An example component that builds, validates and tests an image",
                      "changeDescription": "Initial version.",
                      "dateCreated": "2020-02-19T18:53:45.940Z",
                      "tags": {
                          "KeyName": "KeyValue"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }
