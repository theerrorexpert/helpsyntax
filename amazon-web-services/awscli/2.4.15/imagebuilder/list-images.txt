NAME
       list-images -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the list of images that you have access to.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-images
          [--owner <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--by-name | --no-by-name]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--include-deprecated | --no-include-deprecated]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --owner (string)
          The  owner  defines  which images you want to list. By default, this
          request will only show images owned by your  account.  You  can  use
          this  field to specify if you want to view images owned by yourself,
          by Amazon, or those images that have been shared with you  by  other
          customers.

          Possible values:

          o Self

          o Shared

          o Amazon

       --filters (list)
          Use the following filters to streamline results:

          o name

          o osVersion

          o platform

          o type

          o version

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a list operation. Filters can be used
              to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags,
              attributes, or IDs.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --by-name | --no-by-name (boolean)
          Requests a list of images with a specific recipe name.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum items to return in a request.

       --next-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

       --include-deprecated | --no-include-deprecated (boolean)
          Includes deprecated images in the response list.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       requestId -> (string)
          The request ID that uniquely identifies this request.

       imageVersionList -> (list)
          The list of image semantic versions.

          NOTE:
              The      semantic      version       has       four       nodes:
              <major>.<minor>.<patch>/<build>.  You  can assign values for the
              first three, and can filter on all of them.
                 Filtering: With semantic versioning, you have the flexibility
                 to  use  wildcards (x) to specify the most recent versions or
                 nodes when selecting the base image or  components  for  your
                 recipe. When you use a wildcard in any node, all nodes to the
                 right of the first wildcard must also be wildcards.

          (structure)
              The defining characteristics of a specific version of  an  Image
              Builder image.

              arn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of a specific version of an
                 Image Builder image.

                 NOTE:
                     Semantic versioning is included in each  object's  Amazon
                     Resource  Name  (ARN),  at the level that applies to that
                     object as follows:

                     o Versionless ARNs and Name ARNs do not include  specific
                       values  in  any of the nodes. The nodes are either left
                       off entirely, or they are specified as  wildcards,  for
                       example: x.x.x.

                     o Version   ARNs   have   only  the  first  three  nodes:
                       <major>.<minor>.<patch>

                     o Build version ARNs have all four nodes, and point to  a
                       specific build for a specific version of an object.

              name -> (string)
                 The  name of this specific version of an Image Builder image.

              type -> (string)
                 Specifies whether this image is an AMI or a container  image.

              version -> (string)
                 Details  for  a  specific  version of an Image Builder image.
                 This version follows the semantic version syntax.

                 NOTE:
                     The     semantic     version     has     four      nodes:
                     <major>.<minor>.<patch>/<build>.  You  can  assign values
                     for the first three, and can filter on all of them.
                        Assignment: For the first three nodes you  can  assign
                        any  positive  integer  value, including zero, with an
                        upper limit of 2^30-1, or 1073741823  for  each  node.
                        Image  Builder  automatically assigns the build number
                        to the fourth node.

                        Patterns: You can use any numeric pattern that adheres
                        to  the assignment requirements for the nodes that you
                        can assign. For example, you might choose  a  software
                        version  pattern,  such  as  1.0.0, or a date, such as
                        2021.01.01.

                        Filtering: With  semantic  versioning,  you  have  the
                        flexibility  to  use wildcards (x) to specify the most
                        recent versions or nodes when selecting the base image
                        or components for your recipe. When you use a wildcard
                        in any node, all nodes to the right of the first wild-
                        card must also be wildcards.

              platform -> (string)
                 The  platform  of the image version, for example "Windows" or
                 "Linux".

              osVersion -> (string)
                 The  operating  system  version  of  the  Amazon  EC2   build
                 instance.   For  example,  Amazon  Linux  2,  Ubuntu  18,  or
                 Microsoft Windows Server 2019.

              owner -> (string)
                 The owner of the image version.

              dateCreated -> (string)
                 The date on which this specific version of the Image  Builder
                 image was created.

              buildType -> (string)
                 Indicates  the  type  of  build  that created this image. The
                 build can be initiated in the following ways:

                 o USER_INITIATED  A manual pipeline build request.

                 o SCHEDULED  A pipeline build initiated by a cron  expression
                   in the Image Builder pipeline, or from EventBridge.

                 o IMPORT   A  VM  import created the image to use as the base
                   image for the recipe.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The next token used for paginated responses. When this is not empty,
          there  are  additional elements that the service has not included in
          this request. Use this token with the next request to retrieve addi-
          tional objects.
