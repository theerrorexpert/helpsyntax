DELETE-IMAGE()                                                  DELETE-IMAGE()



NAME
       delete-image -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  an  Image Builder image resource. This does not delete any EC2
       AMIs or ECR container images that are created during  the  image  build
       process. You must clean those up separately, using the appropriate Ama-
       zon EC2 or Amazon ECR console actions, or API or CLI commands.

       o To deregister an EC2 Linux AMI, see Deregister your Linux AMI in  the
         * Amazon EC2 User Guide * .

       o To  deregister an EC2 Windows AMI, see Deregister your Windows AMI in
         the * Amazon EC2 Windows Guide * .

       o To delete a container image from Amazon ECR, see Deleting an image in
         the Amazon ECR User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            delete-image
          --image-build-version-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --image-build-version-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the Image Builder image resource
          to delete.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete an image

       The following delete-image example deletes an image  build  version  by
       specifying its ARN.

          aws imagebuilder delete-image \
              --image-build-version-arn arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-west-2:123456789012:image/my-example-image/2019.12.02/1

       Output:

          {
              "requestId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
              "imageBuildVersionArn": "arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-west-2:123456789012:image/mybasicrecipe/2019.12.03/1"
          }

       Image Pipeline Using the AWS CLI in the EC2 Image Builder Users  Guide.

OUTPUT
       requestId -> (string)
          The request ID that uniquely identifies this request.

       imageBuildVersionArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the Image Builder image resource
          that was deleted.
