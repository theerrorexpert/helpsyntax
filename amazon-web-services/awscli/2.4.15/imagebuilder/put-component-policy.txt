PUT-COMPONENT-POLICY()                                  PUT-COMPONENT-POLICY()



NAME
       put-component-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Applies a policy to a component. We recommend that you call the RAM API
       CreateResourceShare to share resources. If you call the  Image  Builder
       API   PutComponentPolicy   ,   you   must   also   call   the  RAM  API
       PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy in order for the resource  to  be
       visible to all principals with whom the resource is shared.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-component-policy
          --component-arn <value>
          --policy <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --component-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the component that this policy
          should be applied to.

       --policy (string)
          The policy to apply.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To apply a resource policy to a component

       The following put-component-policy command applies a resource policy to
       a  build component to enable cross-account sharing of build components.
       We recommend you use the RAM CLI command create-resource-share. If  you
       use  the  EC2  Image Builder CLI command put-component-policy, you must
       also use the RAM CLI command  promote-resource-share-create-from-policy
       in order for the resource to be visible to all principals with whom the
       resource is shared.

          aws imagebuilder put-component-policy \
              --image-arn arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-west-2:123456789012:component/examplecomponent/2019.12.02/1 \
              --policy '{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Effect": "Allow", "Principal": { "AWS": [ "123456789012" ] }, "Action": [ "imagebuilder:GetComponent", "imagebuilder:ListComponents" ], "Resource": [ "arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-west-2:123456789012:component/examplecomponent/2019.12.02/1" ] } ] }'

       Output:

          {
              "requestId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
              "componentArn": "arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-west-2:123456789012:component/examplecomponent/2019.12.02/1"
          }

OUTPUT
       requestId -> (string)
          The request ID that uniquely identifies this request.

       componentArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the component that this policy was
          applied to.
