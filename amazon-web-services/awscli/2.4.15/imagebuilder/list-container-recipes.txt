SYNOPSIS
            list-container-recipes
          [--owner <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]

OPTIONS
       --owner (string)
          Returns  container  recipes  belonging  to the specified owner, that
          have been shared with you. You can omit this field  to  return  con-
          tainer recipes belonging to your account.

          Possible values:

          o Self

          o Shared

          o Amazon

       --filters (list)
          Use the following filters to streamline results:

          o containerType

          o name

          o parentImage

          o platform

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a list operation. Filters can be used
              to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags,
              attributes, or IDs.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return in the list.

       --next-token (string)
          Provides a token for pagination, which determines where to begin the
          next set of results when the current set reaches the maximum for one
          request.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       requestId -> (string)
          The request ID that uniquely identifies this request.

       containerRecipeSummaryList -> (list)
          The list of container recipes returned for the request.

          (structure)
              A summary of a container recipe

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the container recipe.

              containerType -> (string)
                 Specifies the type of container, such as "Docker".

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the container recipe.

              platform -> (string)
                 The system platform for the container,  such  as  Windows  or
                 Linux.

              owner -> (string)
                 The owner of the container recipe.

              parentImage -> (string)
                 The base image for the container recipe.

              dateCreated -> (string)
                 The date when this container recipe was created.

              tags -> (map)

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  next  token field is used for paginated responses. When this is
          not empty, there are additional container recipes that  the  service
          has  not  included  in  this  response. Use this token with the next
          request to retrieve additional list items.
