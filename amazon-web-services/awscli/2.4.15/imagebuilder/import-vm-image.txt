IMPORT-VM-IMAGE()                                            IMPORT-VM-IMAGE()



NAME
       import-vm-image -

DESCRIPTION
       When you export your virtual machine (VM) from its virtualization envi-
       ronment, that process creates a set of one or more disk container files
       that  act as snapshots of your VMs environment, settings, and data. The
       Amazon EC2 API ImportImage action uses those files to  import  your  VM
       and create an AMI. To import using the CLI command, see import-image

       You  can  reference  the  task ID from the VM import to pull in the AMI
       that the import created as  the  base  image  for  your  Image  Builder
       recipe.

SYNOPSIS
            import-vm-image
          --name <value>
          --semantic-version <value>
          [--description <value>]
          --platform <value>
          [--os-version <value>]
          --vm-import-task-id <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the base image that is created by the import process.

       --semantic-version (string)
          The  semantic  version  to attach to the base image that was created
          during the import process. This version follows the semantic version
          syntax.

          NOTE:
              The       semantic       version       has      four      nodes:
              <major>.<minor>.<patch>/<build>. You can assign values  for  the
              first three, and can filter on all of them.
                 Assignment: For the first three nodes you can assign any pos-
                 itive integer value, including zero, with an upper  limit  of
                 2^30-1,  or 1073741823 for each node. Image Builder automati-
                 cally assigns the build number to the fourth node.

                 Patterns: You can use any numeric pattern that adheres to the
                 assignment  requirements  for  the nodes that you can assign.
                 For example, you might choose  a  software  version  pattern,
                 such as 1.0.0, or a date, such as 2021.01.01.

       --description (string)
          The  description  for  the  base image that is created by the import
          process.

       --platform (string)
          The operating system platform for the imported VM.

          Possible values:

          o Windows

          o Linux

       --os-version (string)
          The operating system version for the imported VM.

       --vm-import-task-id (string)
          The importTaskId (API) or ImportTaskId (CLI) from the Amazon EC2  VM
          import  process. Image Builder retrieves information from the import
          process to pull in the AMI that is created from the VM source as the
          base image for your recipe.

       --tags (map)
          Tags that are attached to the import resources.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --client-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive identifier you provide to ensure idempotency
          of the request. For more information, see  Ensuring  idempotency  in
          the Amazon EC2 API Reference .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       requestId -> (string)
          The request ID that uniquely identifies this request.

       imageArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the AMI that was created during
          the VM import process. This AMI is used as the base  image  for  the
          recipe that imported the VM.

       clientToken -> (string)
          The idempotency token that was used for this request.
