PUT-IMAGE-RECIPE-POLICY()                            PUT-IMAGE-RECIPE-POLICY()



NAME
       put-image-recipe-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Applies a policy to an image recipe. We recommend that you call the RAM
       API CreateResourceShare to share  resources.  If  you  call  the  Image
       Builder  API  PutImageRecipePolicy  ,  you  must  also call the RAM API
       PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy in order for the resource  to  be
       visible to all principals with whom the resource is shared.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-image-recipe-policy
          --image-recipe-arn <value>
          --policy <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --image-recipe-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the image recipe that this policy
          should be applied to.

       --policy (string)
          The policy to apply.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To apply a resource policy to an image recipe

       The following put-image-recipe-policy command applies a resource policy
       to an image recipe to enable cross-account sharing of image recipes. We
       recommend that you use the RAM CLI  command  create-resource-share.  If
       you  use the EC2 Image Builder CLI command put-image-recipe-policy, you
       must  also  use  the  RAM   CLI   command   promote-resource-share-cre-
       ate-from-policy  in order for the resource to be visible to all princi-
       pals with whom the resource is shared.

          aws imagebuilder put-image-recipe-policy \
              --image-recipe-arn arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-west-2:123456789012:image-recipe/example-image-recipe/2019.12.02/1 \
              --policy '{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Effect": "Allow", "Principal": { "AWS": [ "123456789012" ] }, "Action": [ "imagebuilder:GetImageRecipe", "imagebuilder:ListImageRecipes" ], "Resource": [ "arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-west-2:123456789012:image-recipe/example-image-recipe/2019.12.02/1" ] } ] }'

       Output:

          {
              "requestId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
              "imageRecipeArn": "arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-west-2:123456789012:image-recipe/example-image-recipe/2019.12.02/1"
          }

       Image  Pipeline Using the AWS CLI in the EC2 Image Builder Users Guide.

OUTPUT
       requestId -> (string)
          The request ID that uniquely identifies this request.

       imageRecipeArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the image recipe that this  policy
          was applied to.
