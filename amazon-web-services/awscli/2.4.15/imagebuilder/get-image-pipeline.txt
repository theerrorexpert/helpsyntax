GET-IMAGE-PIPELINE()                                      GET-IMAGE-PIPELINE()



NAME
       get-image-pipeline -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets an image pipeline.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-image-pipeline
          --image-pipeline-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --image-pipeline-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the image pipeline that you want
          to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       The following get-image-pipeline example lists the details of an  image
       pipeline by specifying its ARN.

OUTPUT
       requestId -> (string)
          The request ID that uniquely identifies this request.

       imagePipeline -> (structure)
          The image pipeline object.

          arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the image pipeline.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the image pipeline.

          description -> (string)
              The description of the image pipeline.

          platform -> (string)
              The platform of the image pipeline.

          enhancedImageMetadataEnabled -> (boolean)
              Collects  additional  information about the image being created,
              including the operating system (OS) version  and  package  list.
              This  information  is  used to enhance the overall experience of
              using EC2 Image Builder. Enabled by default.

          imageRecipeArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  image  recipe  associated
              with this image pipeline.

          containerRecipeArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the container recipe that is
              used for this pipeline.

          infrastructureConfigurationArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the infrastructure  configura-
              tion associated with this image pipeline.

              associated with this image pipeline.

          imageTestsConfiguration -> (structure)
              The image tests configuration of the image pipeline.

              imageTestsEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Determines if tests should  run  after  building  the  image.
                 Image  Builder  defaults to enable tests to run following the
                 image build, before image distribution.

              timeoutMinutes -> (integer)
                 The maximum time in minutes that tests are permitted to  run.

          schedule -> (structure)
              The schedule of the image pipeline.

              scheduleExpression -> (string)
                 The  cron  expression  determines how often EC2 Image Builder
                 evaluates your pipelineExecutionStartCondition .

                 For information on how to format a cron expression  in  Image
                 Builder, see Use cron expressions in EC2 Image Builder .

              timezone -> (string)
                 The  timezone  that applies to the scheduling expression. For
                 example, "Etc/UTC", "America/Los_Angeles" in the  IANA  time-
                 zone format . If not specified this defaults to UTC.

              pipelineExecutionStartCondition -> (string)
                 The  condition  configures when the pipeline should trigger a
                 new image build. When the pipelineExecutionStartCondition  is
                 set  to  EXPRESSION_MATCH_AND_DEPENDENCY_UPDATES_AVAILABLE  ,
                 and you use semantic version filters on  the  base  image  or
                 components in your image recipe, EC2 Image Builder will build
                 a new image only when there are new versions of the image  or
                 components  in  your  recipe  that match the semantic version
                 filter. When it is set to  EXPRESSION_MATCH_ONLY  ,  it  will
                 build  a new image every time the CRON expression matches the
                 current   time.   For   semantic    version    syntax,    see
                 CreateComponent in the EC2 Image Builder API Reference .

          status -> (string)
              The status of the image pipeline.

          dateCreated -> (string)
              The date on which this image pipeline was created.

          dateUpdated -> (string)
              The date on which this image pipeline was last updated.

          dateLastRun -> (string)
              The date on which this image pipeline was last run.

          dateNextRun -> (string)
              The date on which this image pipeline will next be run.

          tags -> (map)
              The tags of this image pipeline.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)
