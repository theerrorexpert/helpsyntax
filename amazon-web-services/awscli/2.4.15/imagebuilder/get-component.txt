GET-COMPONENT()                                                GET-COMPONENT()



NAME
       get-component -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a component object.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-component
          --component-build-version-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --component-build-version-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the component that you want to
          retrieve. Regex requires "/d+$" suffix.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get component details

       The following get-component example lists the details of a component by
       specifying its ARN.

          aws imagebuilder get-component \
              --component-build-version-arn arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-west-2:123456789012:component/component-name/1.0.0/1

       Output:

          {
              "requestId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
              "component": {
                  "arn": "arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-west-2:123456789012:component/component-name/1.0.0/1",
                  "name": "component-name",
