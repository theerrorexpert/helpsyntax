GET-IMAGE()                                                        GET-IMAGE()



NAME
       get-image -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets an image.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-image
          --image-build-version-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --image-build-version-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the  image  that you want to
          retrieve.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       requestId -> (string)
          The request ID that uniquely identifies this request.

       image -> (structure)
          The image object.

          arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the image.

              NOTE:
                 Semantic  versioning  is  included  in  each  object's Amazon
                 Resource Name (ARN), at the level that applies to that object
                 as follows:

                 o Versionless ARNs and Name ARNs do not include specific val-
                   ues in any of the nodes. The  nodes  are  either  left  off
                   entirely,  or they are specified as wildcards, for example:
                   x.x.x.

                 o Version   ARNs   have   only   the   first   three   nodes:
                   <major>.<minor>.<patch>

                 o Build version ARNs have all four nodes, and point to a spe-
                   cific build for a specific version of an object.

          type -> (string)
              Specifies whether this is an AMI or container image.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the image.

          version -> (string)
              The semantic version of the image.

              NOTE:
                 The      semantic      version      has      four      nodes:
                 <major>.<minor>.<patch>/<build>.  You  can  assign values for
                 the first three, and can filter on all of them.
                     Assignment: For the first three nodes you can assign  any
                     positive  integer  value,  including  zero, with an upper
                     limit of 2^30-1,  or  1073741823  for  each  node.  Image
                     Builder  automatically  assigns  the  build number to the
                     fourth node.

                     Patterns: You can use any numeric pattern that adheres to
                     the  assignment  requirements  for the nodes that you can
                     assign. For example, you might choose a software  version
                     pattern, such as 1.0.0, or a date, such as 2021.01.01.

                     Filtering:  With semantic versioning, you have the flexi-
                     bility to use wildcards (x) to specify  the  most  recent
                     versions or nodes when selecting the base image or compo-
                     nents for your recipe. When you use  a  wildcard  in  any
                     node,  all  nodes to the right of the first wildcard must
                     also be wildcards.

          platform -> (string)
              The platform of the image.

          enhancedImageMetadataEnabled -> (boolean)
              Collects additional information about the image  being  created,
              including  the  operating  system (OS) version and package list.
              This information is used to enhance the  overall  experience  of
              using EC2 Image Builder. Enabled by default.

          osVersion -> (string)
              The  operating system version of the instance. For example, Ama-

              additionalInstanceConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Before you create a new AMI, Image Builder launches temporary
                 Amazon EC2 instances to build and test your image  configura-
                 tion.  Instance  configuration  adds  a layer of control over
                 those instances. You can define settings and add  scripts  to
                 run when an instance is launched from your AMI.

                        from your final build image, prior to creating the new
                        AMI. If this is set to true, then the agent is removed
                        from  the  final image. If it's set to false, then the
                        agent is left in, so that it is included  in  the  new
                        AMI. The default value is false.

                 userDataOverride -> (string)
                     Use this property to provide commands or a command script
                     to run when you launch your build instance.

                     NOTE:
                        The userDataOverride property  replaces  any  commands
                        that  Image  Builder  might  have added to ensure that
                        Systems Manager  is  installed  on  your  Linux  build
                        instance.  If  you  override  the user data, make sure
                        that you add commands to install Systems  Manager,  if
                        it is not pre-installed on your base image.

              image.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the container recipe.

                 NOTE:
                     Semantic versioning is included in each  object's  Amazon
                     Resource  Name  (ARN),  at the level that applies to that
                     object as follows:

                     o Versionless ARNs and Name ARNs do not include  specific
                       values  in  any of the nodes. The nodes are either left
                       off entirely, or they are specified as  wildcards,  for
                       example: x.x.x.

                     o Version   ARNs   have   only  the  first  three  nodes:
                       <major>.<minor>.<patch>

                     o Build version ARNs have all four nodes, and point to  a
                       specific build for a specific version of an object.

              containerType -> (string)
                 Specifies the type of container, such as Docker.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the container recipe.

              description -> (string)
                 The description of the container recipe.

              platform -> (string)
                 The  system  platform  for  the container, such as Windows or
                 Linux.

              owner -> (string)
                 The owner of the container recipe.

              version -> (string)
                 The semantic version of the container recipe.

                 NOTE:
                     The     semantic     version     has     four      nodes:
                     <major>.<minor>.<patch>/<build>.  You  can  assign values
                     for the first three, and can filter on all of them.
                        Assignment: For the first three nodes you  can  assign
                        any  positive  integer  value, including zero, with an
                        upper limit of 2^30-1, or 1073741823  for  each  node.
                        Image  Builder  automatically assigns the build number
                        to the fourth node.

                        Patterns: You can use any numeric pattern that adheres
                        to  the assignment requirements for the nodes that you
                        can assign. For example, you might choose  a  software
                        version  pattern,  such  as  1.0.0, or a date, such as
                        2021.01.01.

                        Filtering: With  semantic  versioning,  you  have  the
                        flexibility  to  use wildcards (x) to specify the most
                        recent versions or nodes when selecting the base image
                        or components for your recipe. When you use a wildcard
                        in any node, all nodes to the right of the first wild-
                        card must also be wildcards.
