NAME
       put-container-recipe-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Applies  a  policy to a container image. We recommend that you call the
       RAM              API               CreateResourceShare               (-
       https://docs.aws.amazon.com//ram/latest/APIReference/API_CreateRe-
       sourceShare.html) to share resources. If you call the Image Builder API
       PutContainerImagePolicy  ,  you  must  also call the RAM API PromoteRe-
       sourceShareCreatedFromPolicy                                         (-
       https://docs.aws.amazon.com//ram/latest/APIReference/API_PromoteRe-
       sourceShareCreatedFromPolicy.html) in order for the resource to be vis-
       ible to all principals with whom the resource is shared.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-container-recipe-policy
          --container-recipe-arn <value>
          --policy <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --container-recipe-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the container recipe that this
          policy should be applied to.

       --policy (string)
          The policy to apply to the container recipe.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       requestId -> (string)
          The request ID that uniquely identifies this request.

       containerRecipeArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  container  recipe  that  this
          policy was applied to.
