SYNOPSIS
            list-image-pipelines
          [--filters <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Use the following filters to streamline results:

          o description

          o distributionConfigurationArn

          o imageRecipeArn

          o infrastructureConfigurationArn

          o name

          o status

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a list operation. Filters can be used
              to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags,
              attributes, or IDs.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum items to return in a request.

       --next-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       requestId -> (string)
          The request ID that uniquely identifies this request.

       imagePipelineList -> (list)
          The list of image pipelines.

          (structure)
              Details of an image pipeline.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the image pipeline.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the image pipeline.

              description -> (string)
                 The description of the image pipeline.

              platform -> (string)
                 The platform of the image pipeline.

              enhancedImageMetadataEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Collects  additional  information  about the image being cre-
                 ated, including the operating system (OS) version and package
                 list. This information is used to enhance the overall experi-
                 ence of using EC2 Image Builder. Enabled by default.

              imageRecipeArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the image recipe associated
                 with this image pipeline.

              containerRecipeArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the container recipe that
                 is used for this pipeline.

              infrastructureConfigurationArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the infrastructure configu-
                 ration associated with this image pipeline.

              distributionConfigurationArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the distribution configura-
                 tion associated with this image pipeline.

              imageTestsConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The image tests configuration of the image pipeline.

                 imageTestsEnabled -> (boolean)
                     Determines if tests should run after building the  image.
                     Image  Builder  defaults to enable tests to run following
                     the image build, before image distribution.

                 timeoutMinutes -> (integer)
                     The maximum time in minutes that tests are  permitted  to
                     run.

              schedule -> (structure)
                 The schedule of the image pipeline.

                 scheduleExpression -> (string)
                     The  cron  expression  determines  how  often  EC2  Image
                     Builder evaluates your pipelineExecutionStartCondition  .

                     For  information  on  how  to format a cron expression in
                     Image Builder, see Use  cron  expressions  in  EC2  Image
                     Builder .

                 timezone -> (string)
                     The  timezone  that applies to the scheduling expression.
                     For example, "Etc/UTC", "America/Los_Angeles" in the IANA
                     timezone  format . If not specified this defaults to UTC.

                 pipelineExecutionStartCondition -> (string)
                     The condition configures when the pipeline should trigger
                     a  new image build. When the pipelineExecutionStartCondi-
                     tion    is     set     to     EXPRESSION_MATCH_AND_DEPEN-
                     DENCY_UPDATES_AVAILABLE  ,  and  you use semantic version
                     filters on the base image or  components  in  your  image
                     recipe,  EC2  Image  Builder  will build a new image only
                     when there are new versions of the image or components in
                     your  recipe that match the semantic version filter. When
                     it is set to EXPRESSION_MATCH_ONLY , it will build a  new
                     image  every time the CRON expression matches the current
                     time. For semantic version syntax, see CreateComponent in
                     the EC2 Image Builder API Reference .

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the image pipeline.

              dateCreated -> (string)
                 The date on which this image pipeline was created.

              dateUpdated -> (string)
                 The date on which this image pipeline was last updated.

              dateLastRun -> (string)
                 The date on which this image pipeline was last run.

              dateNextRun -> (string)
                 The date on which this image pipeline will next be run.

              tags -> (map)
                 The tags of this image pipeline.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          The next token used for paginated responses. When this is not empty,
          there are additional elements that the service has not  included  in
          this request. Use this token with the next request to retrieve addi-
          tional objects.
