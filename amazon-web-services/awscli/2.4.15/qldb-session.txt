DESCRIPTION
       The transactional data APIs for Amazon QLDB

       NOTE:
          Instead  of  interacting  directly with this API, we recommend using
          the QLDB driver or the QLDB shell to execute data transactions on  a
          ledger.

          o If  you  are  working  with  an  AWS SDK, use the QLDB driver. The
            driver provides a high-level abstraction  layer  above  this  QLDB
            Session  data plane and manages SendCommand API calls for you. For
            information and a list of  supported  programming  languages,  see
            Getting started with the driver in the Amazon QLDB Developer Guide
            .

          o If you are working with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS  CLI),
            use  the  QLDB  shell.  The shell is a command line interface that
            uses the QLDB driver to interact with a ledger.  For  information,
            see Accessing Amazon QLDB using the QLDB shell .
