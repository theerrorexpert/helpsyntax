DESCRIPTION
       Savings Plans are a pricing model that offer significant savings on AWS
       usage (for example, on Amazon EC2 instances). You commit to  a  consis-
       tent  amount of usage, in USD per hour, for a term of 1 or 3 years, and
       receive a lower price for that usage. For more information, see the AWS
       Savings Plans User Guide .
