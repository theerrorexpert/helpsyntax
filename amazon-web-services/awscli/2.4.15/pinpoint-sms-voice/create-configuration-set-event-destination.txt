OPTIONS
       --configuration-set-name (string) ConfigurationSetName

       --event-destination  (structure)  An object that defines a single event
       destination.CloudWatchLogsDestination -> (structure)
              An object that contains information about an  event  destination
              that sends data to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

              IamRoleArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of an Amazon Identity and
                 Access Management (IAM) role that is able to write event data
                 to an Amazon CloudWatch destination.

              LogGroupArn -> (string)
                 The  name of the Amazon CloudWatch Log Group that you want to
                 record events in.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether or not the event destination  is  enabled.  If
              the  event  destination  is  enabled, then Amazon Pinpoint sends
              response data to the specified event destination.

          KinesisFirehoseDestination -> (structure)
              An object that contains information about an  event  destination
              that sends data to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose.

              DeliveryStreamArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that can write
                 data to an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose stream.

              IamRoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  Amazon  Kinesis  Data
                 Firehose destination that you want to use in the event desti-
                 nation.

          MatchingEventTypes -> (list)
              An array  of  EventDestination  objects.  Each  EventDestination
              object  includes ARNs and other information that define an event
              destination.

              (string)
                 The types of events that are sent to the event destination.

          SnsDestination -> (structure)
              An object that contains information about an  event  destination
              that sends data to Amazon SNS.

              TopicArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic that
                 you want to publish events to.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CloudWatchLogsDestination={IamRoleArn=string,LogGroupArn=string},Enabled=boolean,KinesisFirehoseDestination={DeliveryStreamArn=string,IamRoleArn=string},MatchingEventTypes=string,string,SnsDestination={TopicArn=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CloudWatchLogsDestination": {
              "IamRoleArn": "string",
              "LogGroupArn": "string"
            },
            "Enabled": true|false,
            "KinesisFirehoseDestination": {
              "DeliveryStreamArn": "string",
              "IamRoleArn": "string"
            },
            "MatchingEventTypes": ["INITIATED_CALL"|"RINGING"|"ANSWERED"|"COMPLETED_CALL"|"BUSY"|"FAILED"|"NO_ANSWER", ...],
            "SnsDestination": {
              "TopicArn": "string"
            }
          }

       --event-destination-name (string) A name that identifies the event des-
       tination.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
