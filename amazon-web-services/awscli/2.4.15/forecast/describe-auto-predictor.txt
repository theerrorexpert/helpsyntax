DESCRIBE-AUTO-PREDICTOR()                            DESCRIBE-AUTO-PREDICTOR()



NAME
       describe-auto-predictor -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  a predictor created using the CreateAutoPredictor operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-auto-predictor
          --predictor-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --predictor-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the predictor.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the predictor

       PredictorName -> (string)
          The name of the predictor.

       ForecastHorizon -> (integer)
          The number of time-steps that the model predicts. The forecast hori-
          zon is also called the prediction length.

       ForecastTypes -> (list)
          The  forecast types used during predictor training. Default value is

          training data for the predictor.

          (string)

       DataConfig -> (structure)
          The  data  configuration  for  your dataset group and any additional
          datasets.

          AttributeConfigs -> (list)
              Aggregation and filling options for attributes in  your  dataset
              group.

              (structure)
                 Provides  information  about  the  method  used  to transform
                 attributes.

                 The following is an example using the RETAIL domain:
                     {

                     "AttributeName": "demand",

                     "Transformations": {"aggregation":  "sum",  "middlefill":
                     "zero", "backfill": "zero"}

                     }

                 AttributeName -> (string)
                     The  name  of  the  attribute as specified in the schema.
                     Amazon Forecast supports the target field of  the  target
                     time  series  and  the  related time series datasets. For
                     example, for the RETAIL domain, the target is demand .

                 Transformations -> (map)
                     The method parameters (key-value pairs), which are a  map
                     of override parameters. Specify these parameters to over-
                     ride the default values. Related Time  Series  attributes
                     do not accept aggregation parameters.

                     The  following  list shows the parameters and their valid
                     values for the "filling" featurization method for a  Tar-
                     get Time Series dataset. Default values are bolded.

                     o aggregation : sum , avg , first , min , max

                     o frontfill : none

                     o middlefill  : zero , nan (not a number), value , median
                       , mean , min , max

                     o backfill : zero , nan , value , median , mean ,  min  ,
                       max

                     The  following  list shows the parameters and their valid
                     values for a Related  Time  Series  featurization  method
                     (there are no defaults):

                     o middlefill : zero , value , median , mean , min , max

                     o backfill : zero , value , median , mean , min , max

                     o futurefill : zero , value , median , mean , min , max

                     To set a filling method to a specific value, set the fill
                     parameter to value and define the value in a  correspond-
                     ing  _value parameter. For example, to set backfilling to
                     a value of 2, include the following: "backfill":  "value"
                     and "backfill_value":"2" .

                 with  over  two years of historical weather data and up to 14
                 days of projected weather data.  For  more  information,  see

                 Holidays  is  a  built-in  dataset that incorporates national
                 holiday information into your model. It provides native  sup-
                 port  for  the holiday calendars of 66 countries. To view the
                 holiday calendars, refer to the Jollyday  library.  For  more
