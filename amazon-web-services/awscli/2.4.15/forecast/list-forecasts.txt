LIST-FORECASTS()                                              LIST-FORECASTS()



NAME
       list-forecasts -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of forecasts created using the  CreateForecast opera-
       tion. For each forecast, this operation returns a summary of its  prop-
       erties,  including its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). To retrieve the com-
       plete set of properties, specify the  ARN  with  the   DescribeForecast
       operation. You can filter the list using an array of  Filter objects.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-forecasts  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Forecasts

SYNOPSIS
            list-forecasts
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          An array of filters. For each filter, you provide a condition and  a
          match statement. The condition is either IS or IS_NOT , which speci-
          fies whether to include or exclude  the  forecasts  that  match  the
          statement  from the list, respectively. The match statement consists
          of a key and a value.
              Filter properties

          o Condition - The condition to apply. Valid values are IS and IS_NOT
            .  To include the forecasts that match the statement, specify IS .
            To exclude matching forecasts, specify IS_NOT .

          o Key - The name of the parameter to filter  on.  Valid  values  are
            DatasetGroupArn , PredictorArn , and Status .

          o Value - The value to match.

          For  example,  to list all forecasts whose status is not ACTIVE, you
          would specify:
              "Filters": [ { "Condition": "IS_NOT", "Key": "Status",  "Value":
              "ACTIVE" } ]

          (structure)
              Describes a filter for choosing a subset of objects. Each filter
              consists of a condition and a match statement. The condition  is
              either  IS  or  IS_NOT  ,  which specifies whether to include or
              exclude the objects that match the statement, respectively.  The
              match statement consists of a key and a value.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the parameter to filter on.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value to match.

              Condition -> (string)
                 The condition to apply. To include the objects that match the
                 statement, specify IS . To exclude matching objects,  specify
                 IS_NOT .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string,Condition=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string",
              "Condition": "IS"|"IS_NOT"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Forecasts -> (list)
          An array of objects that summarize each forecast's properties.

          (structure)
              Provides a summary of the forecast properties used in the  List-
              Forecasts operation. To get the complete set of properties, call
              the  DescribeForecast operation,  and  provide  the  ForecastArn
              that is listed in the summary.

              ForecastArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the forecast.

              ForecastName -> (string)
                 The name of the forecast.

              PredictorArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the predictor used to generate the forecast.

              CreatedUsingAutoPredictor -> (boolean)
                 Whether the Forecast was created from an AutoPredictor.

              DatasetGroupArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset group that pro-
                 vided the data used to train the predictor.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the forecast. States include:

                 o ACTIVE

                 o CREATE_PENDING , CREATE_IN_PROGRESS , CREATE_FAILED

                 o CREATE_STOPPING , CREATE_STOPPED

                 o DELETE_PENDING , DELETE_IN_PROGRESS , DELETE_FAILED

                 NOTE:
                     The Status of the forecast must be ACTIVE before you  can
                     query or export the forecast.

              Message -> (string)
                 If  an  error  occurred,  an  informational message about the
                 error.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 When the forecast creation task was created.

              LastModificationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The last  time  the  resource  was  modified.  The  timestamp
                 depends on the status of the job:

                 o CREATE_PENDING - The CreationTime .

                 o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS - The current timestamp.

                 o CREATE_STOPPING - The current timestamp.

                 o CREATE_STOPPED - When the job stopped.

                 o ACTIVE  or CREATE_FAILED - When the job finished or failed.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response is truncated, Amazon Forecast returns this token. To
          retrieve the next set of results, use the token in the next request.
