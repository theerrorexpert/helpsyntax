NAME
       describe-explainability-export -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  an  Explainability  export created using the  CreateExplain-
       abilityExport operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-explainability-export
          --explainability-export-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --explainability-export-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Explainability export.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ExplainabilityExportArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Explainability export.

       ExplainabilityExportName -> (string)
          The name of the Explainability export.

       ExplainabilityArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Explainability.

       Destination -> (structure)
          The destination for an export job. Provide an S3 path, an AWS  Iden-
          tity and Access Management (IAM) role that allows Amazon Forecast to
          access the location, and an AWS Key  Management  Service  (KMS)  key
          (optional).

          S3Config -> (structure)
              The  path to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket
              along with the credentials to access the bucket.

              Path -> (string)
                 The path to an Amazon  Simple  Storage  Service  (Amazon  S3)
                 bucket or file(s) in an Amazon S3 bucket.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role
                 that Amazon Forecast can  assume  to  access  the  Amazon  S3
                 bucket  or  files.  If  you provide a value for the KMSKeyArn
                 key, the role must allow access to the key.

                 Passing a role across AWS accounts is  not  allowed.  If  you
                 pass a role that isn't in your account, you get an InvalidIn-
                 putException error.

              KMSKeyArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Key Management  Ser-
                 vice (KMS) key.

       Message -> (string)
          Information about any errors that occurred during the export.

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the Explainability export. States include:

          o ACTIVE

          o CREATE_PENDING , CREATE_IN_PROGRESS , CREATE_FAILED

          o CREATE_STOPPING , CREATE_STOPPED

          o DELETE_PENDING , DELETE_IN_PROGRESS , DELETE_FAILED

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          When the Explainability export was created.

       LastModificationTime -> (timestamp)
          The  last  time  the resource was modified. The timestamp depends on
          the status of the job:

          o CREATE_PENDING - The CreationTime .

          o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS - The current timestamp.

          o CREATE_STOPPING - The current timestamp.

          o CREATE_STOPPED - When the job stopped.

          o ACTIVE or CREATE_FAILED - When the job finished or failed.
