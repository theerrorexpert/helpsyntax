CREATE-DATASET-IMPORT-JOB()                        CREATE-DATASET-IMPORT-JOB()



NAME
       create-dataset-import-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Imports  your  training data to an Amazon Forecast dataset. You provide
       the location of your training data in an Amazon Simple Storage  Service
       (Amazon  S3)  bucket  and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset
       that you want to import the data to.

       You must specify a  DataSource object that includes an AWS Identity and
       Access  Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume to access
       the data, as Amazon Forecast makes a copy of your data and processes it
       in  an  internal  AWS  system.  For  more  information,  see  aws-fore-
       cast-iam-roles .

       The training data must be in CSV format. The delimiter must be a  comma
       (,).

       You can specify the path to a specific CSV file, the S3 bucket, or to a
       folder in the S3 bucket. For the  latter  two  cases,  Amazon  Forecast
       imports all files up to the limit of 10,000 files.

       Because  dataset  imports  are not aggregated, your most recent dataset
       import is the one that is used when training a predictor or  generating
       a forecast. Make sure that your most recent dataset import contains all
       of the data you want to model off of, and not just the  new  data  col-
       lected since the previous import.

       To  get  a  list of all your dataset import jobs, filtered by specified
       criteria, use the  ListDatasetImportJobs operation.

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dataset-import-job-name (string)
          The name for the dataset import job. We recommend including the cur-
          rent  timestamp  in  the  name, for example, 20190721DatasetImport .
          This can help you  avoid  getting  a  ResourceAlreadyExistsException
          exception.

       --dataset-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Forecast dataset that
          you want to import data to.

       --data-source (structure)
          The location of the training data to import and an AWS Identity  and
          Access  Management  (IAM)  role  that  Amazon Forecast can assume to
          access the data. The training data must be stored in  an  Amazon  S3
          bucket.

          If encryption is used, DataSource must include an AWS Key Management
          Service (KMS) key and the IAM role must allow Amazon  Forecast  per-
          mission to access the key. The KMS key and IAM role must match those
          specified in the EncryptionConfig parameter  of  the   CreateDataset
          operation.

          S3Config -> (structure)
              The  path to the data stored in an Amazon Simple Storage Service
              (Amazon S3) bucket along with  the  credentials  to  access  the
              data.

              Path -> (string)
                 The  path  to  an  Amazon  Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
                 bucket or file(s) in an Amazon S3 bucket.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)  role
                 that  Amazon  Forecast  can  assume  to  access the Amazon S3
                 bucket or files. If you provide a  value  for  the  KMSKeyArn
                 key, the role must allow access to the key.

                 Passing  a  role  across  AWS accounts is not allowed. If you
                 pass a role that isn't in your account, you get an InvalidIn-
                 putException error.

              KMSKeyArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Key Management Ser-
                 vice (KMS) key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Config={Path=string,RoleArn=string,KMSKeyArn=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Config": {
              "Path": "string",
              "RoleArn": "string",
              "KMSKeyArn": "string"
            }
          }

       --timestamp-format (string)
          The format of timestamps in the dataset. The format that you specify
          depends on the DataFrequency specified when the dataset was created.
          The following formats are supported

          o "yyyy-MM-dd" For the following data frequencies: Y, M, W, and D

          o "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"  For  the  following  data  frequencies:  H,
            30min, 15min, and 1min; and optionally, for: Y, M, W, and D

          If the format isn't specified, Amazon Forecast expects the format to
          be "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss".

       --time-zone (string)
          A single time zone for every item in your dataset.  This  option  is
          ideal for datasets with all timestamps within a single time zone, or
          if all timestamps are normalized to a single time zone.

          Refer to the Joda-Time API for a complete list of  valid  time  zone
          names.

       --use-geolocation-for-time-zone   |  --no-use-geolocation-for-time-zone
       (boolean)
          Automatically derive time  zone  information  from  the  geolocation
          attribute. This option is ideal for datasets that contain timestamps
          in multiple time zones and those timestamps are expressed  in  local
          time.

       --geolocation-format (string)
          The  format  of the geolocation attribute. The geolocation attribute
          can be formatted in one of two ways:

          o LAT_LONG - the latitude and longitude in decimal format (Example:
            47.61_
            -122.33).

          o CC_POSTALCODE (US Only) - the country code (US), followed  by  the
            5-digit ZIP code (Example: US_98121).

       --tags (list)
          The  optional  metadata  that you apply to the dataset import job to
          help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists  of  a  key
          and an optional value, both of which you define.

          The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

          o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.

          o For  each  resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key
            can have only one value.

          o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

          o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

          o If your tagging  schema  is  used  across  multiple  services  and
            resources,  remember  that other services may have restrictions on
            allowed characters. Generally  allowed  characters  are:  letters,
            numbers,  and  spaces  representable  in  UTF-8, and the following
            characters: + - = . _ : / @.

          o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

          o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination  of
            such  as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use. You can-
            not edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this
            prefix. If a tag value has aws as its prefix but the key does not,
            then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against
            the  limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of aws do not
            count against your tags per resource limit.

          (structure)
              The optional metadata that you apply to a resource to  help  you
              categorize  and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an
              optional value, both of which you define.

              The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

              o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.

              o For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and  each  tag
                key can have only one value.

              o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

              o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

              o If  your  tagging  schema is used across multiple services and
                resources, remember that other services may have  restrictions
                on  allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: let-
                ters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the fol-
                lowing characters: + - = . _ : / @.

              o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

              o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination
                of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved  for  AWS  use.
                You  cannot  edit  or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values
                can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as its prefix but
                the  key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag
                and will count against the limit of 50 tags.  Tags  with  only
                the  key  prefix  of  aws  do  not count against your tags per
                resource limit.

              Key -> (string)
                 One part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A key is  a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              Value -> (string)
                 The optional part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag.  A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       DatasetImportJobArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset import job.
