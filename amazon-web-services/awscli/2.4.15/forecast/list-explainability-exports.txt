LIST-EXPLAINABILITY-EXPORTS()                    LIST-EXPLAINABILITY-EXPORTS()



NAME
       list-explainability-exports -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of Explainability exports created using the  CreateEx-
       plainabilityExport operation. This operation returns a summary for each
       Explainability  export. You can filter the list using an array of  Fil-
       ter objects.

       To retrieve the complete set of properties for  a  particular  Explain-
       ability export, use the ARN with the  DescribeExplainability operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-explainability-exports
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          If the result of the previous request was  truncated,  the  response
          includes  a  NextToken. To retrieve the next set of results, use the
          token in the next request. Tokens expire after 24 hours.

       --max-results (integer)
          The number of items to return in the response.

       --filters (list)
          An array of filters. For each filter,  provide  a  condition  and  a
          match statement. The condition is either IS or IS_NOT , which speci-
          fies whether to include or exclude resources that match  the  state-
          ment  from  the  list.  The  match statement consists of a key and a
          value.
              Filter properties

          o Condition - The condition to apply. Valid values are IS and IS_NOT
            .

          o Key  -  The  name  of the parameter to filter on. Valid values are
            ResourceArn and Status .

          o Value - The value to match.

          (structure)
              Describes a filter for choosing a subset of objects. Each filter
              consists  of a condition and a match statement. The condition is
              either IS or IS_NOT , which  specifies  whether  to  include  or
              exclude  the objects that match the statement, respectively. The
              match statement consists of a key and a value.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the parameter to filter on.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value to match.

              Condition -> (string)
                 The condition to apply. To include the objects that match the
                 statement,  specify IS . To exclude matching objects, specify
                 IS_NOT .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string,Condition=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string",
              "Condition": "IS"|"IS_NOT"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ExplainabilityExports -> (list)
          An array of objects that summarize the properties of  each  Explain-
          ability export.

          (structure)
              Provides  a summary of the Explainability export properties used
              in the  ListExplainabilityExports operation. To get  a  complete
              set of properties, call the  DescribeExplainabilityExport opera-
              tion, and provide the ExplainabilityExportArn .

              ExplainabilityExportArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Explainability  export.

              ExplainabilityExportName -> (string)
                 The name of the Explainability export

              Destination -> (structure)
                 The destination for an export job. Provide an S3 path, an AWS
                 Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that allows  Amazon
                 Forecast  to  access  the location, and an AWS Key Management
                 Service (KMS) key (optional).

                 S3Config -> (structure)
                     The path to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon  S3)
                     bucket along with the credentials to access the bucket.

                     Path -> (string)
                        The  path  to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon
                        S3) bucket or file(s) in an Amazon S3 bucket.

                     RoleArn -> (string)
                        The ARN of the  AWS  Identity  and  Access  Management
                        (IAM)  role  that Amazon Forecast can assume to access
                        the Amazon S3 bucket or files. If you provide a  value
                        for  the  KMSKeyArn key, the role must allow access to
                        the key.

                        Passing a role across AWS accounts is not allowed.  If
                        you pass a role that isn't in your account, you get an
                        InvalidInputException error.

                     KMSKeyArn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS  Key  Manage-
                        ment Service (KMS) key.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the Explainability export. States include:

                 o ACTIVE

                 o CREATE_PENDING , CREATE_IN_PROGRESS , CREATE_FAILED

                 o CREATE_STOPPING , CREATE_STOPPED

                 o DELETE_PENDING , DELETE_IN_PROGRESS , DELETE_FAILED

              Message -> (string)
                 Information  about  any  errors that may have occurred during
                 the Explainability export.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 When the Explainability was created.

              LastModificationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The last  time  the  resource  was  modified.  The  timestamp
                 depends on the status of the job:

                 o CREATE_PENDING - The CreationTime .

                 o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS - The current timestamp.

                 o CREATE_STOPPING - The current timestamp.

                 o CREATE_STOPPED - When the job stopped.

                 o ACTIVE  or CREATE_FAILED - When the job finished or failed.

       NextToken -> (string)
          Returns this token if the response is  truncated.  To  retrieve  the
          next set of results, use the token in the next request.
