LIST-EXPLAINABILITIES()                                LIST-EXPLAINABILITIES()



NAME
       list-explainabilities -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of Explainability resources created using the  CreateEx-
       plainability operation. This  operation  returns  a  summary  for  each
       Explainability.  You  can  filter  the  list  using an array of  Filter
       objects.

       To retrieve the complete set of properties for  a  particular  Explain-
       ability  resource,  use the ARN with the  DescribeExplainability opera-
       tion.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-explainabilities
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          If the result of the previous request was  truncated,  the  response
          includes  a  NextToken. To retrieve the next set of results, use the
          token in the next request. Tokens expire after 24 hours.

       --max-results (integer)
          The number of items returned in the response.

       --filters (list)
          An array of filters. For each filter,  provide  a  condition  and  a
          match statement. The condition is either IS or IS_NOT , which speci-
          fies whether to include or exclude  the  resources  that  match  the
          statement from the list. The match statement consists of a key and a
          value.
              Filter properties

          o Condition - The condition to apply. Valid values are IS and IS_NOT
            .

          o Key  -  The  name  of the parameter to filter on. Valid values are
            ResourceArn and Status .

          o Value - The value to match.

          (structure)
              Describes a filter for choosing a subset of objects. Each filter
              consists  of a condition and a match statement. The condition is
              either IS or IS_NOT , which  specifies  whether  to  include  or
              exclude  the objects that match the statement, respectively. The
              match statement consists of a key and a value.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the parameter to filter on.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value to match.

              Condition -> (string)
                 The condition to apply. To include the objects that match the
                 statement,  specify IS . To exclude matching objects, specify
                 IS_NOT .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string,Condition=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string",
              "Condition": "IS"|"IS_NOT"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Explainabilities -> (list)
          An array of objects that summarize the properties of  each  Explain-
          ability resource.

          (structure)
              Provides  a summary of the Explainability properties used in the
              ListExplainabilities operation. To get a complete set of proper-
              ties,  call  the   DescribeExplainability operation, and provide
              the listed ExplainabilityArn .

              ExplainabilityArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Explainability.

                 The name of the Explainability.

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Predictor  or  Forecast
                 used to create the Explainability.

              ExplainabilityConfig -> (structure)
                 The  configuration  settings  that  define the granularity of
                 time series and time points for the Explainability.

                 TimeSeriesGranularity -> (string)
                     To create an Explainability for all time series  in  your

                     cific time series in your datasets, use SPECIFIC .

                     Specify time series by uploading a CSV file to an  Amazon
                     S3  bucket  and set the location within the  DataDestina-
                     tion data type.

                 TimePointGranularity -> (string)
                     To create an Explainability for all time points  in  your
                     forecast  horizon,  use ALL . To create an Explainability
                     for specific time points in your  forecast  horizon,  use
                     SPECIFIC .

                     Specify  time  points with the StartDateTime and EndDate-
                     Time parameters within the   CreateExplainability  opera-
                     tion.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the Explainability. States include:

                 o ACTIVE

                 o CREATE_PENDING , CREATE_IN_PROGRESS , CREATE_FAILED

                 o CREATE_STOPPING , CREATE_STOPPED

                 o DELETE_PENDING , DELETE_IN_PROGRESS , DELETE_FAILED

              Message -> (string)
                 Information  about  any  errors that may have occurred during
                 the Explainability creation process.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 When the Explainability was created.

              LastModificationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The last  time  the  resource  was  modified.  The  timestamp
                 depends on the status of the job:

                 o CREATE_PENDING - The CreationTime .

                 o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS - The current timestamp.

                 o CREATE_STOPPING - The current timestamp.

                 o CREATE_STOPPED - When the job stopped.

                 o ACTIVE  or CREATE_FAILED - When the job finished or failed.

       NextToken -> (string)
          Returns this token if the response is  truncated.  To  retrieve  the
          next set of results, use the token in the next request.
