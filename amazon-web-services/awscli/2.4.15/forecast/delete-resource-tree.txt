DELETE-RESOURCE-TREE()                                  DELETE-RESOURCE-TREE()



NAME
       delete-resource-tree -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  an entire resource tree. This operation will delete the parent
       resource and its child resources.

       Child resources are resources that were created from another  resource.
       For  example,  when a forecast is generated from a predictor, the fore-
       cast is the child resource and the predictor is the parent resource.

       Amazon Forecast resources possess the following  parent-child  resource
       hierarchies:

       o Dataset : dataset import jobs

       o Dataset  Group  :  predictors,  predictor backtest export jobs, fore-
         casts, forecast export jobs

       o Predictor :  predictor  backtest  export  jobs,  forecasts,  forecast
         export jobs

       o Forecast : forecast export jobs

       NOTE:
          DeleteResourceTree  will  only delete Amazon Forecast resources, and
          will not delete datasets or exported files stored in Amazon S3.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-resource-tree
          --resource-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the parent resource to delete. All
          child resources of the parent resource will also be deleted.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
