LIST-DATASET-GROUPS()                                    LIST-DATASET-GROUPS()



NAME
       list-dataset-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list of dataset groups created using the  CreateDatasetGroup
       operation. For each dataset group, this operation returns a summary  of
       its  properties,  including  its  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN). You can
       retrieve the complete set of properties by using the dataset group  ARN
       with the  DescribeDatasetGroup operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-dataset-groups is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: DatasetGroups

SYNOPSIS
            list-dataset-groups
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DatasetGroups -> (list)
          An  array of objects that summarize each dataset group's properties.

          (structure)
              Provides a summary of the dataset group properties used  in  the
              ListDatasetGroups  operation. To get the complete set of proper-
              ties, call the  DescribeDatasetGroup operation, and provide  the
              DatasetGroupArn .

              DatasetGroupArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset group.

              DatasetGroupName -> (string)
                 The name of the dataset group.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 When the dataset group was created.

              LastModificationTime -> (timestamp)
                 When  the  dataset  group  was created or last updated from a
                 call to the  UpdateDatasetGroup operation. While the  dataset
                 group  is  being updated, LastModificationTime is the current
                 time of the ListDatasetGroups call.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response is truncated, Amazon Forecast returns this token. To
          retrieve the next set of results, use the token in the next request.
