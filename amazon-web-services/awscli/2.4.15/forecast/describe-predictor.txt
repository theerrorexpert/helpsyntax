         ing data.

       o AutoMLAlgorithmArns  -  If  AutoML  is performed, the algorithms that
         were evaluated.

       o CreationTime

SYNOPSIS
            describe-predictor
          --predictor-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --predictor-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the predictor that you want infor-
          mation about.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          NOTE:
              The LatencyOptimized AutoML override strategy is only  available
              in  private beta. Contact AWS Support or your account manager to
              learn more about access privileges.

          The AutoML strategy used to train the predictor. Unless LatencyOpti-
          mized  is  specified,  the AutoML strategy optimizes predictor accu-
          racy.

       PerformHPO -> (boolean)
          Whether the predictor is set to perform hyperparameter  optimization
          (HPO).

       TrainingParameters -> (map)
          The  default  training parameters or overrides selected during model
          training. When  running  AutoML  or  choosing  HPO  with  CNN-QR  or

          value -> (string)

       EvaluationParameters -> (structure)
          Used  to override the default evaluation parameters of the specified

          dataset  into training data and testing data. The evaluation parame-
          ters define how to perform the split and the number of iterations.

              the value as the number of data points. The default is the value
              of the forecast horizon. BackTestWindowOffset  can  be  used  to
              mimic  a  past  virtual  forecast start date. This value must be
              greater than or equal to the forecast horizon and less than half
              of the TARGET_TIME_SERIES dataset length.

                        scale for the hyperparameter.
                            Linear

                        Hyperparameter  tuning  searches  the  values  in  the

                        hyperparameter range by using a logarithmic scale.

                        Logarithmic  scaling  works  only for ranges that have

              An array of dimension (field) names that specify  how  to  group
              the generated forecast.

              For example, suppose that you are generating a forecast for item
              sales across all of your stores, and  your  dataset  contains  a
              store_id  field. If you want the sales forecast for each item by
              store, you would specify store_id as the dimension.

              All forecast  dimensions  specified  in  the  TARGET_TIME_SERIES
              dataset  don't  need  to  be  specified  in  the CreatePredictor
              request.   All   forecast   dimensions    specified    in    the
              RELATED_TIME_SERIES  dataset must be specified in the CreatePre-
              dictor request.

              (string)

          Featurizations -> (list)
              An array of featurization (transformation) information  for  the
              fields of a dataset.

              (structure)

                 NOTE:
                     This object belongs to the  CreatePredictor operation. If
                     you created your predictor  with   CreateAutoPredictor  ,
                     see  AttributeConfig .

                 Provides  featurization  (transformation)  information  for a
                 dataset field. This object is part of the   FeaturizationCon-
                 fig object.

                 For example:
                     {

                     "AttributeName": "demand",

                     FeaturizationPipeline [ {

                     "FeaturizationMethodName": "filling",

                     "FeaturizationMethodParameters":  {"aggregation":  "avg",
                     "backfill": "nan"}

                     } ]

                     }

                 AttributeName -> (string)
                     The name of the schema attribute that specifies the  data
                     field to be featurized. Amazon Forecast supports the tar-
                     get   field   of   the   TARGET_TIME_SERIES    and    the
                     RELATED_TIME_SERIES datasets. For example, for the RETAIL
                     domain, the target is demand , and for the CUSTOM domain,
                     the  target  is  target_value . For more information, see
                     howitworks-missing-values .

                 FeaturizationPipeline -> (list)

                        (transforms) a dataset field. The method  is  part  of
                        the   FeaturizationPipeline   of   the   Featurization
                        object.

                        The following is an example of how you specify a  Fea-
                        turizationMethod object.
                            {

                            "FeaturizationMethodName": "filling",

                            The name of the method. The  "filling"  method  is

                            a map of override parameters. Specify these param-
                            eters to override the default values. Related Time
                            Series attributes do not accept aggregation param-
                            eters.

                            The  following list shows the parameters and their
                            valid  values  for  the  "filling"   featurization
                            method for a Target Time Series dataset. Bold sig-
                            nifies the default value.

                            o aggregation : sum , avg , first , min , max

                            o frontfill : none

                            valid  values for a Related Time Series featuriza-
                            tion method (there are no defaults):

                            o middlefill : zero , value , median , mean ,  min
                              , max

                              , max

                            To  set  a filling method to a specific value, set
                            the fill parameter to value and define  the  value
                            in  a corresponding _value parameter. For example,
                            to set backfilling to a value of  2,  include  the
                            following:    "backfill":   "value"   and   "back-
