LIST-PREDICTOR-BACKTEST-EXPORT-JOBS()    LIST-PREDICTOR-BACKTEST-EXPORT-JOBS()



NAME
       list-predictor-backtest-export-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of  predictor  backtest export jobs created using the
       CreatePredictorBacktestExportJob operation. This  operation  returns  a
       summary  for each backtest export job. You can filter the list using an
       array of  Filter objects.

       To retrieve the complete set of properties for  a  particular  backtest
       export  job,  use  the ARN with the  DescribePredictorBacktestExportJob
       operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-predictor-backtest-export-jobs is a paginated operation.  Multiple
       API  calls  may  be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: PredictorBacktestExportJobs

SYNOPSIS
            list-predictor-backtest-export-jobs
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          An  array  of  filters.  For  each filter, provide a condition and a
          match statement. The condition is either IS or IS_NOT , which speci-
          fies  whether  to  include  or exclude the predictor backtest export
          jobs that match the statement from the  list.  The  match  statement
          consists of a key and a value.
              Filter properties

          o Condition - The condition to apply. Valid values are IS and IS_NOT
            . To include the predictor backtest export  jobs  that  match  the
            statement,  specify  IS  .  To exclude matching predictor backtest
            export jobs, specify IS_NOT .

          o Key - The name of the parameter to filter  on.  Valid  values  are
            PredictorArn and Status .

          o Value - The value to match.

          (structure)
              Describes a filter for choosing a subset of objects. Each filter
              consists of a condition and a match statement. The condition  is
              either  IS  or  IS_NOT  ,  which specifies whether to include or
              exclude the objects that match the statement, respectively.  The
              match statement consists of a key and a value.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the parameter to filter on.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value to match.

              Condition -> (string)
                 The condition to apply. To include the objects that match the
                 statement, specify IS . To exclude matching objects,  specify
                 IS_NOT .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string,Condition=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string",
              "Condition": "IS"|"IS_NOT"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PredictorBacktestExportJobs -> (list)
          An array of objects that summarize the properties of each  predictor
          backtest export job.

          (structure)
              Provides  a summary of the predictor backtest export job proper-
              ties used in the  ListPredictorBacktestExportJobs operation.  To
              get  a  complete set of properties, call the  DescribePredictor-
              BacktestExportJob operation, and provide the  listed  Predictor-
              BacktestExportJobArn .

              PredictorBacktestExportJobArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of the predictor backtest
                 export job.

              PredictorBacktestExportJobName -> (string)
                 The name of the predictor backtest export job.

              Destination -> (structure)
                 The destination for an export job. Provide an S3 path, an AWS
                 Identity  and Access Management (IAM) role that allows Amazon
                 Forecast to access the location, and an  AWS  Key  Management
                 Service (KMS) key (optional).

                 S3Config -> (structure)
                     The  path to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
                     bucket along with the credentials to access the bucket.

                     Path -> (string)
                        The path to an Amazon Simple Storage  Service  (Amazon
                        S3) bucket or file(s) in an Amazon S3 bucket.

                     RoleArn -> (string)
                        The  ARN  of  the  AWS  Identity and Access Management
                        (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume  to  access
                        the  Amazon S3 bucket or files. If you provide a value
                        for the KMSKeyArn key, the role must allow  access  to
                        the key.

                        Passing  a role across AWS accounts is not allowed. If
                        you pass a role that isn't in your account, you get an
                        InvalidInputException error.

                     KMSKeyArn -> (string)
                        The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Key Manage-
                        ment Service (KMS) key.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of  the  predictor  backtest  export  job.  States
                 include:

                 o ACTIVE

                 o CREATE_PENDING , CREATE_IN_PROGRESS , CREATE_FAILED

                 o CREATE_STOPPING , CREATE_STOPPED

                 o DELETE_PENDING , DELETE_IN_PROGRESS , DELETE_FAILED

              Message -> (string)
                 Information  about  any  errors that may have occurred during
                 the backtest export.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 When the predictor backtest export job was created.

              LastModificationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The last  time  the  resource  was  modified.  The  timestamp
                 depends on the status of the job:

                 o CREATE_PENDING - The CreationTime .

                 o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS - The current timestamp.

                 o CREATE_STOPPING - The current timestamp.

                 o CREATE_STOPPED - When the job stopped.

                 o ACTIVE  or CREATE_FAILED - When the job finished or failed.

       NextToken -> (string)
          Returns this token if the response is  truncated.  To  retrieve  the
          next set of results, use the token in the next request.
