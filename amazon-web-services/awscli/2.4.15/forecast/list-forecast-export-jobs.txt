LIST-FORECAST-EXPORT-JOBS()                        LIST-FORECAST-EXPORT-JOBS()



NAME
       list-forecast-export-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of forecast export jobs created using the  CreateFore-
       castExportJob operation. For each forecast export job,  this  operation
       returns a summary of its properties, including its Amazon Resource Name
       (ARN). To retrieve the complete set of properties, use the ARN with the
       DescribeForecastExportJob  operation.  You can filter the list using an
       array of  Filter objects.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-forecast-export-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: ForecastExportJobs

SYNOPSIS
            list-forecast-export-jobs
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          An  array of filters. For each filter, you provide a condition and a
          match statement. The condition is either IS or IS_NOT , which speci-
          fies  whether  to  include  or exclude the forecast export jobs that
          match the statement from the list, respectively. The match statement
          consists of a key and a value.
              Filter properties

          o Condition - The condition to apply. Valid values are IS and IS_NOT
            . To include the forecast export jobs that  match  the  statement,
            specify  IS  .  To  exclude matching forecast export jobs, specify
            IS_NOT .

          o Key - The name of the parameter to filter  on.  Valid  values  are
            ForecastArn and Status .

          o Value - The value to match.

          For example, to list all jobs that export a forecast named electric-
          ityforecast , specify the following filter:
              "Filters": [ { "Condition": "IS", "Key": "ForecastArn", "Value":
              "arn:aws:forecast:us-west-2:<acct-id>:forecast/electricityfore-
              cast" } ]

          (structure)
              Describes a filter for choosing a subset of objects. Each filter
              consists  of a condition and a match statement. The condition is
              either IS or IS_NOT , which  specifies  whether  to  include  or
              exclude  the objects that match the statement, respectively. The
              match statement consists of a key and a value.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the parameter to filter on.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value to match.

              Condition -> (string)
                 The condition to apply. To include the objects that match the
                 statement,  specify IS . To exclude matching objects, specify
                 IS_NOT .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string,Condition=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string",
              "Condition": "IS"|"IS_NOT"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ForecastExportJobs -> (list)
          An array of objects that summarize each export job's properties.

          (structure)
              Provides a summary of the forecast export job properties used in
              the  ListForecastExportJobs operation. To get the  complete  set
              of  properties,  call  the  DescribeForecastExportJob operation,
              and provide the listed ForecastExportJobArn .

              ForecastExportJobArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the forecast export job.

              ForecastExportJobName -> (string)
                 The name of the forecast export job.

              Destination -> (structure)
                 The path to the Amazon Simple  Storage  Service  (Amazon  S3)
                 bucket where the forecast is exported.

                 S3Config -> (structure)
                     The  path to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
                     bucket along with the credentials to access the bucket.

                     Path -> (string)
                        The path to an Amazon Simple Storage  Service  (Amazon
                        S3) bucket or file(s) in an Amazon S3 bucket.

                     RoleArn -> (string)
                        The  ARN  of  the  AWS  Identity and Access Management
                        (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume  to  access
                        the  Amazon S3 bucket or files. If you provide a value
                        for the KMSKeyArn key, the role must allow  access  to
                        the key.

                        Passing  a role across AWS accounts is not allowed. If
                        you pass a role that isn't in your account, you get an
                        InvalidInputException error.

                     KMSKeyArn -> (string)
                        The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Key Manage-
                        ment Service (KMS) key.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the forecast export job. States include:

                 o ACTIVE

                 o CREATE_PENDING , CREATE_IN_PROGRESS , CREATE_FAILED

                 o CREATE_STOPPING , CREATE_STOPPED

                 o DELETE_PENDING , DELETE_IN_PROGRESS , DELETE_FAILED

                 NOTE:
                     The Status of the forecast  export  job  must  be  ACTIVE
                     before you can access the forecast in your S3 bucket.

              Message -> (string)
                 If  an  error  occurred,  an  informational message about the
                 error.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 When the forecast export job was created.

              LastModificationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The last  time  the  resource  was  modified.  The  timestamp
                 depends on the status of the job:

                 o CREATE_PENDING - The CreationTime .

                 o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS - The current timestamp.

                 o CREATE_STOPPING - The current timestamp.

                 o CREATE_STOPPED - When the job stopped.

                 o ACTIVE  or CREATE_FAILED - When the job finished or failed.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response is truncated, Amazon Forecast returns this token. To
          retrieve the next set of results, use the token in the next request.
