SYNOPSIS
            describe-dataset-import-job
          --dataset-import-job-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dataset-import-job-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset import job.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DatasetImportJobName -> (string)
          The name of the dataset import job.

       DatasetImportJobArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the dataset import job.

       DatasetArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset that the training data
          was imported to.

       TimestampFormat -> (string)
          The format of timestamps in the dataset. The format that you specify
          depends on the DataFrequency specified when the dataset was created.
          The following formats are supported

          o "yyyy-MM-dd" For the following data frequencies: Y, M, W, and D

          o "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"  For  the  following  data  frequencies:  H,
            30min, 15min, and 1min; and optionally, for: Y, M, W, and D

       TimeZone -> (string)
          The single time zone applied to every item in the dataset

       UseGeolocationForTimeZone -> (boolean)
          Whether  TimeZone  is  automatically  derived  from  the geolocation
          attribute.

       GeolocationFormat -> (string)
          The format of the geolocation attribute. Valid Values:"LAT_LONG" and
          "CC_POSTALCODE" .

       DataSource -> (structure)
          The  location of the training data to import and an AWS Identity and
          Access Management (IAM) role that  Amazon  Forecast  can  assume  to
          access the data.

          If  encryption  is  used,  DataSource includes an AWS Key Management
          Service (KMS) key.

          S3Config -> (structure)
              The path to the data stored in an Amazon Simple Storage  Service
              (Amazon  S3)  bucket  along  with  the credentials to access the
              data.

              Path -> (string)
                 The path to an Amazon  Simple  Storage  Service  (Amazon  S3)
                 bucket or file(s) in an Amazon S3 bucket.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role

                 bucket  or  files.  If  you provide a value for the KMSKeyArn
                 key, the role must allow access to the key.

                 Passing a role across AWS accounts is  not  allowed.  If  you
                 pass a role that isn't in your account, you get an InvalidIn-
                 putException error.

              KMSKeyArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Key Management  Ser-
                 vice (KMS) key.
