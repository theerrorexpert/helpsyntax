NAME
       describe-forecast -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes a forecast created using the  CreateForecast operation.

       In  addition  to  listing the properties provided in the CreateForecast
       request, this operation lists the following properties:

       o DatasetGroupArn - The dataset group that provided the training  data.

       o CreationTime

       o LastModificationTime

       o Status

       o Message - If an error occurred, information about the error.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-forecast
          --forecast-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --forecast-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the forecast.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ForecastArn -> (string)
          The forecast ARN as specified in the request.

       ForecastName -> (string)
          The name of the forecast.

       ForecastTypes -> (list)
          The quantiles at which probabilistic forecasts were generated.

          (string)

       PredictorArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the predictor used to generate the forecast.

       DatasetGroupArn -> (string)
          The  ARN  of  the dataset group that provided the data used to train
          the predictor.

       EstimatedTimeRemainingInMinutes -> (long)
          The estimated time remaining in minutes for the forecast job to com-
          plete.

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the forecast. States include:

          o ACTIVE

          o CREATE_PENDING , CREATE_IN_PROGRESS , CREATE_FAILED

          o CREATE_STOPPING , CREATE_STOPPED

          o DELETE_PENDING , DELETE_IN_PROGRESS , DELETE_FAILED

          NOTE:
              The  Status  of the forecast must be ACTIVE before you can query
              or export the forecast.

       Message -> (string)
          If an error occurred, an informational message about the error.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          When the forecast creation task was created.

       LastModificationTime -> (timestamp)
          The last time the resource was modified. The  timestamp  depends  on
          the status of the job:

          o CREATE_PENDING - The CreationTime .

          o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS - The current timestamp.

          o CREATE_STOPPING - The current timestamp.

          o CREATE_STOPPED - When the job stopped.

          o ACTIVE or CREATE_FAILED - When the job finished or failed.
