LIST-DATASETS()                                                LIST-DATASETS()



NAME
       list-datasets -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list of datasets created using the  CreateDataset operation.
       For each dataset, a summary of its  properties,  including  its  Amazon
       Resource Name (ARN), is returned. To retrieve the complete set of prop-
       erties, use the ARN with the  DescribeDataset operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-datasets is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Datasets

SYNOPSIS
            list-datasets
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Datasets -> (list)
          An array of objects that summarize each dataset's properties.

          (structure)
              Provides a summary of the dataset properties used in the   List-
              Datasets  operation. To get the complete set of properties, call
              the  DescribeDataset operation, and provide the DatasetArn .

              DatasetArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset.

              DatasetName -> (string)
                 The name of the dataset.

              DatasetType -> (string)
                 The dataset type.

              Domain -> (string)
                 The domain associated with the dataset.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 When the dataset was created.

              LastModificationTime -> (timestamp)
                 When you create a dataset, LastModificationTime is  the  same
                 as  CreationTime  .  While  data  is  being  imported  to the
                 dataset, LastModificationTime is  the  current  time  of  the
                 ListDatasets  call. After a  CreateDatasetImportJob operation
                 has finished, LastModificationTime is  when  the  import  job
                 completed or failed.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response is truncated, Amazon Forecast returns this token. To
          retrieve the next set of results, use the token in the next request.
