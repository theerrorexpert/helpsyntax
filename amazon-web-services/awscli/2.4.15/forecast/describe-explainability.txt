DESCRIBE-EXPLAINABILITY()                            DESCRIBE-EXPLAINABILITY()



NAME
       describe-explainability -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  an Explainability resource created using the  CreateExplain-
       ability operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-explainability
          --explainability-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --explainability-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Explaianability to describe.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ExplainabilityArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Explainability.

       ExplainabilityName -> (string)
          The name of the Explainability.

       ResourceArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Predictor or Forecast used  to
          create the Explainability resource.

       ExplainabilityConfig -> (structure)
          The  configuration  settings  that  define  the  granularity of time
          series and time points for the Explainability.

          TimeSeriesGranularity -> (string)
              To  create  an  Explainability  for  all  time  series  in  your
              datasets,  use  ALL  .  To create an Explainability for specific
              time series in your datasets, use SPECIFIC .

              Specify time series by uploading a CSV  file  to  an  Amazon  S3
              bucket  and  set  the  location within the  DataDestination data
              type.

          TimePointGranularity -> (string)
              To create an Explainability for all time points in your forecast
              horizon, use ALL . To create an Explainability for specific time
              points in your forecast horizon, use SPECIFIC .

              Specify time  points  with  the  StartDateTime  and  EndDateTime
              parameters within the  CreateExplainability operation.

       EnableVisualization -> (boolean)
          Whether   the  visualization  was  enabled  for  the  Explainability
          resource.

       DataSource -> (structure)
          The source of your data, an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
          role that allows Amazon Forecast to access the data and, optionally,
          an AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key.

          S3Config -> (structure)
              The path to the data stored in an Amazon Simple Storage  Service
              (Amazon  S3)  bucket  along  with  the credentials to access the
              data.

              Path -> (string)
                 The path to an Amazon  Simple  Storage  Service  (Amazon  S3)
                 bucket or file(s) in an Amazon S3 bucket.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role
                 that Amazon Forecast can  assume  to  access  the  Amazon  S3
                 bucket  or  files.  If  you provide a value for the KMSKeyArn
                 key, the role must allow access to the key.

                 Passing a role across AWS accounts is  not  allowed.  If  you
                 pass a role that isn't in your account, you get an InvalidIn-
                 putException error.

              KMSKeyArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Key Management  Ser-
                 vice (KMS) key.

       Schema -> (structure)
          Defines the fields of a dataset.

          Attributes -> (list)
              An  array  of  attributes  specifying  the name and type of each
              field in a dataset.

              (structure)
                 An attribute of a schema, which defines a  dataset  field.  A
                 schema  attribute  is  required for every field in a dataset.
                 The  Schema  object  contains  an  array  of  SchemaAttribute
                 objects.

                 AttributeName -> (string)
                     The name of the dataset field.

                 AttributeType -> (string)
                     The data type of the field.

       StartDateTime -> (string)
          If TimePointGranularity is set to SPECIFIC , the first time point in
          the Explainability.

       EndDateTime -> (string)
          If TimePointGranularity is set to SPECIFIC , the last time point  in
          the Explainability.

       EstimatedTimeRemainingInMinutes -> (long)
          The  estimated time remaining in minutes for the  CreateExplainabil-
          ity job to complete.

       Message -> (string)
          If an error occurred, a message about the error.

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the Explainability resource. States include:

          o ACTIVE

          o CREATE_PENDING , CREATE_IN_PROGRESS , CREATE_FAILED

          o CREATE_STOPPING , CREATE_STOPPED

          o DELETE_PENDING , DELETE_IN_PROGRESS , DELETE_FAILED

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          When the Explainability resource was created.

       LastModificationTime -> (timestamp)
          The last time the resource was modified. The  timestamp  depends  on
          the status of the job:

          o CREATE_PENDING - The CreationTime .

          o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS - The current timestamp.

          o CREATE_STOPPING - The current timestamp.

          o CREATE_STOPPED - When the job stopped.
