CREATE-FORECAST()                                            CREATE-FORECAST()



NAME
       create-forecast -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a forecast for each item in the TARGET_TIME_SERIES dataset that
       was used to train  the  predictor.  This  is  known  as  inference.  To
       retrieve  the forecast for a single item at low latency, use the opera-
       tion. To export the complete forecast into your Amazon  Simple  Storage
       Service (Amazon S3) bucket, use the  CreateForecastExportJob operation.

       The range of the forecast is determined by the  ForecastHorizon  value,
       which  you  specify  in  the  CreatePredictor request. When you query a
       forecast, you can request a specific date range within the forecast.

       To get a list of all your forecasts, use the  ListForecasts  operation.

       NOTE:
          The forecasts generated by Amazon Forecast are in the same time zone
          as the dataset that was used to create the predictor.

       For more information, see  howitworks-forecast .

       NOTE:
          The Status of the forecast must be ACTIVE before you  can  query  or
          export  the forecast. Use the  DescribeForecast operation to get the
          status.

SYNOPSIS
            create-forecast
          --forecast-name <value>
          --predictor-arn <value>
          [--forecast-types <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --forecast-name (string)
          A name for the forecast.

       --predictor-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the predictor to use  to  generate
          the forecast.

       --forecast-types (list)
          The  quantiles  at  which probabilistic forecasts are generated. You
          can currently specify up to 5 quantiles per forecast . Accepted val-
          ues  include  0.01  to  0.99 (increments of .01 only) and mean . The
          mean forecast is different from the median (0.50) when the distribu-
          tion is not symmetric (for example, Beta and Negative Binomial). The
          default value is ["0.1", "0.5", "0.9"] .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          The optional metadata that you apply to the  forecast  to  help  you
          categorize  and  organize  them.  Each  tag consists of a key and an
          optional value, both of which you define.

          The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

          o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.

          o For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each  tag  key
            can have only one value.

          o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

          o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

          o If  your  tagging  schema  is  used  across  multiple services and
            resources, remember that other services may have  restrictions  on
            allowed  characters.  Generally  allowed  characters are: letters,
            numbers, and spaces representable  in  UTF-8,  and  the  following
            characters: + - = . _ : / @.

          o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

          o Do  not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination of
            such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use. You  can-
            not edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this
            prefix. If a tag value has aws as its prefix but the key does not,
            then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against
            the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of aws do  not
            count against your tags per resource limit.

          (structure)
              The  optional  metadata that you apply to a resource to help you
              categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and  an
              optional value, both of which you define.

              The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

              o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.

              o For  each  resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag
                key can have only one value.

              o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

              o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

              o If your tagging schema is used across  multiple  services  and
                resources,  remember that other services may have restrictions
                on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are:  let-
                ters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the fol-
                lowing characters: + - = . _ : / @.

              o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

              o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination
                of  such  as  a prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use.
                You cannot edit or delete tag keys with  this  prefix.  Values
                can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as its prefix but
                the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user  tag
                and  will  count  against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only
                the key prefix of aws do  not  count  against  your  tags  per
                resource limit.

              Key -> (string)
                 One  part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A key is a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  optional part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ForecastArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the forecast.
