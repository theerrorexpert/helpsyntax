LIST-PREDICTORS()                                            LIST-PREDICTORS()



NAME
       list-predictors -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list of predictors created using the  CreateAutoPredictor or
       CreatePredictor operations. For each predictor, this operation  returns
       a  summary of its properties, including its Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

       You can retrieve the complete set of properties by using the  ARN  with
       the   DescribeAutoPredictor  and  DescribePredictor operations. You can
       filter the list using an array of  Filter objects.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-predictors is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Predictors

SYNOPSIS
            list-predictors
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          An  array of filters. For each filter, you provide a condition and a
          match statement. The condition is either IS or IS_NOT , which speci-
          fies  whether  to  include  or exclude the predictors that match the
          statement from the list, respectively. The match statement  consists
          of a key and a value.
              Filter properties

          o Condition - The condition to apply. Valid values are IS and IS_NOT
            . To include the predictors that match the statement, specify IS .
            To exclude matching predictors, specify IS_NOT .

          o Key  -  The  name  of the parameter to filter on. Valid values are
            DatasetGroupArn and Status .

          o Value - The value to match.

          For example, to list all predictors  whose  status  is  ACTIVE,  you
          would specify:
              "Filters":  [  {  "Condition":  "IS",  "Key": "Status", "Value":
              "ACTIVE" } ]

          (structure)
              Describes a filter for choosing a subset of objects. Each filter
              consists  of a condition and a match statement. The condition is
              either IS or IS_NOT , which  specifies  whether  to  include  or
              exclude  the objects that match the statement, respectively. The
              match statement consists of a key and a value.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the parameter to filter on.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value to match.

              Condition -> (string)
                 The condition to apply. To include the objects that match the
                 statement,  specify IS . To exclude matching objects, specify
                 IS_NOT .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string,Condition=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string",
              "Condition": "IS"|"IS_NOT"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Predictors -> (list)
          An array of objects that summarize each predictor's properties.

          (structure)
              Provides  a summary of the predictor properties that are used in
              the  ListPredictors operation. To get the complete set of  prop-
              erties,  call  the  DescribePredictor operation, and provide the
              listed PredictorArn .

              PredictorArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the predictor.

              PredictorName -> (string)
                 The name of the predictor.

              DatasetGroupArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset group that con-
                 tains the data used to train the predictor.

              IsAutoPredictor -> (boolean)
                 Whether AutoPredictor was used to create the predictor.

              ReferencePredictorSummary -> (structure)
                 A  summary  of  the reference predictor used if the predictor
                 was retrained or upgraded.

                 Arn -> (string)
                     The ARN of the reference predictor.

                 State -> (string)
                     Whether the reference predictor is Active or Deleted .

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the predictor. States include:

                 o ACTIVE

                 o CREATE_PENDING , CREATE_IN_PROGRESS , CREATE_FAILED

                 o DELETE_PENDING , DELETE_IN_PROGRESS , DELETE_FAILED

                 o CREATE_STOPPING , CREATE_STOPPED

                 NOTE:
                     The Status of the predictor must be ACTIVE before you can
                     use the predictor to create a forecast.

              Message -> (string)
                 If  an  error  occurred,  an  informational message about the
                 error.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 When the model training task was created.

              LastModificationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The last  time  the  resource  was  modified.  The  timestamp
                 depends on the status of the job:

                 o CREATE_PENDING - The CreationTime .

                 o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS - The current timestamp.

                 o CREATE_STOPPING - The current timestamp.

                 o CREATE_STOPPED - When the job stopped.

                 o ACTIVE  or CREATE_FAILED - When the job finished or failed.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response is truncated, Amazon Forecast returns this token. To
          retrieve the next set of results, use the token in the next request.
