DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  FHIR  import jobs associated with an account and their sta-

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-fhir-import-jobs
          --datastore-id <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--job-name <value>]
          [--job-status <value>]
          [--submitted-before <value>]
          [--submitted-after <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --datastore-id (string)
          This parameter limits the response to the import job with the speci-
          fied Data Store ID.

       --next-token (string)
          A  pagination  token  used  to  identify the next page of results to
          return for a ListFHIRImportJobs query.

       --max-results (integer)
          This parameter limits the number of results returned for a ListFHIR-
          ImportJobs to a maximum quantity specified by the user.

       --job-name (string)
          This parameter limits the response to the import job with the speci-
          fied job name.

       --job-status (string)
          This parameter limits the response to the import job with the speci-
          fied job status.

          Possible values:

          o SUBMITTED

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS

          o COMPLETED

          o FAILED

       --submitted-before (timestamp)
          This  parameter  limits  the  response to FHIR import jobs submitted
          before a user specified date.

       --submitted-after (timestamp)
          This parameter limits the response to  FHIR  import  jobs  submitted
          after a user specified date.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list all FHIR import jobs

       The  following  list-fhir-import-jobs example shows how to use the com-
       mand to view a list of all import jobs associated with an account.

          aws healthlake list-fhir-import-jobs \
              --datastore-id (Datastore ID) \
              --submitted-before (DATE like 2024-10-13T19:00:00Z) \
              --submitted-after (DATE like 2020-10-13T19:00:00Z ) \
              --job-name "FHIR-IMPORT" \
              --job-status SUBMITTED  \
              -max-results (Integer between 1 and 500)

       Output:

          {
              "ImportJobProperties": {

              },
              },
