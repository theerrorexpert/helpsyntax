SYNOPSIS
            start-fhir-export-job
          [--job-name <value>]
          --output-data-config <value>
          --datastore-id <value>
          --data-access-role-arn <value>
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-name (string)
          The user generated name for an export job.

       --output-data-config (structure)
          The  output data configuration that was supplied when the export job
          was created.

          S3Configuration -> (structure)
              The output data configuration that was supplied when the  export
              job was created.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 The  S3Uri is the user specified S3 location of the FHIR data
                 to be imported into Amazon HealthLake.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The KMS key ID used to access the S3 bucket.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Configuration={S3Uri=string,KmsKeyId=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Configuration": {
              "S3Uri": "string",
              "KmsKeyId": "string"
            }
          }

       --datastore-id (string)
          The AWS generated ID for the Data Store from which files  are  being
          exported for an export job.

       --data-access-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name used during the initiation of the job.

       --client-token (string)
          An optional user provided token used for ensuring idempotency.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To start a FHIR export job

       The  following  start-fhir-export-job example shows how to start a FHIR
       export job using Amazon HealthLake.

          aws healthlake start-fhir-export-job \
              --output-data-config S3Uri="s3://(Bucket Name)/(Prefix Name)/" \
              --datastore-id (Datastore ID) \
              --data-access-role-arn arn:aws:iam::(AWS Account ID):role/(Role Name)

       Output:

          {
              "DatastoreId": "(Datastore ID)",
              "JobStatus": "SUBMITTED",
              "JobId": "9b9a51943afaedd0a8c0c26c49135a31"
          }

       For more information, see Exporting files from a FHIR Data Store in the
       Amazon HealthLake Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       JobId -> (string)
          The AWS generated ID for an export job.

       JobStatus -> (string)
          The  status  of  a FHIR export job. Possible statuses are SUBMITTED,
          IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, or FAILED.

       DatastoreId -> (string)
          The AWS generated ID for the Data Store from which files  are  being
          exported for an export job.
