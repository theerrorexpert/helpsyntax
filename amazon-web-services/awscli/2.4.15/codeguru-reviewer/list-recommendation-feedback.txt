SYNOPSIS
            list-recommendation-feedback
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          --code-review-arn <value>
          [--user-ids <value>]
          [--recommendation-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          If nextToken is returned, there  are  more  results  available.  The
          value  of nextToken is a unique pagination token for each page. Make
          the call again using the returned token to retrieve the  next  page.
          Keep all other arguments unchanged.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  results  that  are  returned per call. The
          default is 100.

       --code-review-arn (string)
          The   Amazon   Resource   Name   (ARN)   of   the    `    CodeReview
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-api/API_CodeReview.html`__
          object.

       --user-ids (list)
          An Amazon Web Services user's account ID  or  Amazon  Resource  Name
          (ARN).  Use  this ID to query the recommendation feedback for a code
          review from that user.

          The UserId is an IAM principal that can be specified  as  an  Amazon
          Web  Services  account ID or an Amazon Resource Name (ARN). For more
          information, see Specifying a Principal in the Amazon  Web  Services
          Identity and Access Management User Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --recommendation-ids (list)
          Used  to  query  the recommendation feedback for a given recommenda-
          tion.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
