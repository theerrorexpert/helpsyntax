ASSOCIATE-REPOSITORY()                                  ASSOCIATE-REPOSITORY()



NAME
       associate-repository -

DESCRIPTION
       Use  to  associate  an  Amazon  Web Services CodeCommit repository or a
       repostory managed by Amazon Web Services CodeStar Connections with Ama-
       zon  CodeGuru  Reviewer.  When  you  associate  a  repository, CodeGuru
       Reviewer reviews source code changes in the repository's pull  requests
       and  provides  automatic  recommendations. You can view recommendations
       using  the  CodeGuru  Reviewer  console.  For  more  information,   see
       Recommendations  in  Amazon  CodeGuru  Reviewer  in the Amazon CodeGuru
       Reviewer User Guide.

       If you associate a CodeCommit or S3 repository, it must be in the  same
       Amazon  Web  Services  Region and Amazon Web Services account where its
       CodeGuru Reviewer code reviews are configured.

       Bitbucket and GitHub Enterprise Server repositories are managed by Ama-
       zon  Web Services CodeStar Connections to connect to CodeGuru Reviewer.
       For more information, see Associate a repository in the Amazon CodeGuru
       Reviewer User Guide.

       NOTE:
          You  cannot use the CodeGuru Reviewer SDK or the Amazon Web Services
          CLI to associate a GitHub repository with Amazon CodeGuru  Reviewer.
          To associate a GitHub repository, use the console. For more informa-
          tion, see Getting started with CodeGuru  Reviewer  in  the  CodeGuru
          Reviewer User Guide.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CodeCommit={Name=string},Bitbucket={Name=string,ConnectionArn=string,Owner=string},GitHubEnterpriseServer={Name=string,ConnectionArn=string,Owner=string},S3Bucket={Name=string,BucketName=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CodeCommit": {
              "Name": "string"
            },
            "Bitbucket": {
              "Name": "string",
              "ConnectionArn": "string",
              "Owner": "string"
            },
            "GitHubEnterpriseServer": {
              "Name": "string",
              "ConnectionArn": "string",
              "Owner": "string"
            },
            "S3Bucket": {
              "Name": "string",

            }
          }

       --client-request-token (string)
          Amazon  CodeGuru  Reviewer uses this value to prevent the accidental
          creation of duplicate repository associations if there are  failures
          and retries.

       --tags (map)
          An  array of key-value pairs used to tag an associated repository. A
          tag is a custom attribute label with two parts:

          o A tag key (for example, CostCenter , Environment ,  Project  ,  or
            Secret ). Tag keys are case sensitive.

          o An  optional field known as a tag value (for example, 111122223333
            , Production , or a team name). Omitting the tag value is the same
            as  using an empty string. Like tag keys, tag values are case sen-
            sitive.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --kms-key-details (structure)
          A KMSKeyDetails object that contains:

          o The encryption option  for  this  repository  association.  It  is
            either  owned  by Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS)
            (AWS_OWNED_CMK ) or customer managed (CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK ).

          o The ID of the Amazon Web Services KMS key that is associated  with
            this respository association.

          KMSKeyId -> (string)
              The  ID  of  the  Amazon Web Services KMS key that is associated
              with a respository association.

          EncryptionOption -> (string)
              The encryption option for a repository association. It is either
              owned  by  Amazon  Web  Services  Key  Management  Service (KMS)
              (AWS_OWNED_CMK ) or customer managed (CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK ).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KMSKeyId=string,EncryptionOption=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "KMSKeyId": "string",
            "EncryptionOption": "AWS_OWNED_CMK"|"CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

          Owner -> (string)
              The owner of the repository. For an Amazon Web Services CodeCom-
              mit  repository,  this  is the Amazon Web Services account ID of

              The valid repository association states are:

              o Associated : The repository association is complete.

              o Associating : CodeGuru Reviewer is:

                o Setting  up pull request notifications. This is required for
                  pull requests to trigger a CodeGuru Reviewer review.

                NOTE:
                   If your repository ProviderType is GitHub ,  GitHub  Enter-
                   prise  Server  ,  or  Bitbucket , CodeGuru Reviewer creates
                   webhooks in your repository to  trigger  CodeGuru  Reviewer
                   reviews.  If  you delete these webhooks, reviews of code in
                   your repository cannot be triggered.

                o Setting up source code access. This is required for CodeGuru
                  Reviewer to securely clone code in your repository.

              o Failed : The repository failed to associate or disassociate.

              o Disassociating  :  CodeGuru  Reviewer  is removing the reposi-
                tory's pull request notifications and source code access.

              o Disassociated : CodeGuru Reviewer  successfully  disassociated
                the  repository.  You  can  create a new association with this
                repository if you want to review source code in it later.  You
                can  control  access  to code reviews created in an associated
                repository with tags after it has been disassociated. For more
                information,  see  Using  tags to control access to associated
                repositories in the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide .

          StateReason -> (string)
              A description of why the repository association is in  the  cur-
              rent state.

          LastUpdatedTimeStamp -> (timestamp)
              The  time,  in milliseconds since the epoch, when the repository
              association was last updated.

          CreatedTimeStamp -> (timestamp)
              The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when  the  repository
              association was created.

                AGED_CMK ).

              o The ID of the Amazon Web Services KMS key that  is  associated
                with this respository association.

                 SourceCodeArtifactsObjectKey -> (string)
                     The  S3  object  key for a source code .zip file. This is
                     required for all code reviews.

                 BuildArtifactsObjectKey -> (string)
                     The S3 object key for a build artifacts  .zip  file  that
                     contains  .jar  or  .class  files. This is required for a
                     code review with security analysis. For more information,
                     see  Create  code  reviews  with security analysis in the

       Tags -> (map)
          An array of key-value pairs used to tag an associated repository.  A
          tag is a custom attribute label with two parts:

          o A  tag  key  (for example, CostCenter , Environment , Project , or
            Secret ). Tag keys are case sensitive.

          o An optional field known as a tag value (for example,  111122223333
            , Production , or a team name). Omitting the tag value is the same
            as using an empty string. Like tag keys, tag values are case  sen-
            sitive.
