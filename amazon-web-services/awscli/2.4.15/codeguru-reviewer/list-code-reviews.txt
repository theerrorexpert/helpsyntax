       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-code-reviews
          [--provider-types <value>]
          [--states <value>]
          [--repository-names <value>]
          --type <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --provider-types (list)
          List of provider types for filtering that needs to be applied before
          displaying  the  result.  For  example, providerTypes=[GitHub] lists
          code reviews from GitHub.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            CodeCommit
            GitHub
            Bitbucket
            GitHubEnterpriseServer
            S3Bucket

       --states (list)
          List of states for filtering that needs to be  applied  before  dis-
          playing the result. For example, states=[Pending] lists code reviews
          in the Pending state.

          The valid code review states are:

          o Completed : The code review is complete.

          o Pending : The code review started and has not completed or failed.

          o Failed : The code review failed.

          o Deleting : The code review is being deleted.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            Completed
            Pending
            Failed
            Deleting

       --repository-names (list)
          List  of  repository  names  for  filtering that needs to be applied
          before displaying the result.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --type (string)
          The type of code reviews to list in the response.

          Possible values:

          o PullRequest

          o RepositoryAnalysis

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of  results  that  are  returned  per  call.  The
          default is 100.

       --next-token (string)
          If  nextToken  is  returned,  there  are more results available. The
          value of nextToken is a unique pagination token for each page.  Make
          the  call  again using the returned token to retrieve the next page.
          Keep all other arguments unchanged.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list code reviews created in your AWS account in the last 90 days.

       The following list-code-reviews example lists the code reviews  created
       in the last 90 days using pull requests.

          aws codeguru-reviewer list-code-reviews \
              --type PullRequest

                 The valid code review states are:

                 o Completed : The code review is complete.

                 o Pending  : The code review started and has not completed or
                   failed.

                 o Failed : The code review failed.

                 o Deleting : The code review is being deleted.

              CreatedTimeStamp -> (timestamp)
                 The time, in milliseconds since  the  epoch,  when  the  code
                 review was created.

              LastUpdatedTimeStamp -> (timestamp)
                 The  time,  in  milliseconds  since  the epoch, when the code
                 review was last updated.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of the code review.

              PullRequestId -> (string)
                 The pull request ID for the code review.

              MetricsSummary -> (structure)
                 The statistics from the code review.

                 MeteredLinesOfCodeCount -> (long)
                     Lines of code metered in the code review. For the initial
                     code  review  pull  request and all subsequent revisions,
                     this includes all lines of code in the files added to the
                     pull  request.  In  subsequent  revisions, for files that
                     already existed in the pull request, this  includes  only
                     the  changed  lines of code. In both cases, this does not
                     include non-code lines such as comments and import state-
                     ments. For example, if you submit a pull request contain-
                     ing 5 files, each with 500 lines of code, and in a subse-
                     quent  revision  you  added  a new file with 200 lines of
                     code, and also modified a total of 25  lines  across  the
                     initial  5  files,  MeteredLinesOfCodeCount  includes the
                     first 5 files (5 * 500 = 2,500 lines), the new file  (200
                     lines)  and  the  25 changed lines of code for a total of
                     2,725 lines of code.

                 FindingsCount -> (long)
                     Total number of recommendations found in the code review.

              SourceCodeType -> (structure)
                 Specifies  the source code that is analyzed in a code review.

                 CommitDiff -> (structure)

                     MergeBaseCommit -> (string)
                        The SHA of the merge base of a commit.
