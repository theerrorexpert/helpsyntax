       list-repository-associations is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: RepositoryAssociationSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-repository-associations
          [--provider-types <value>]
          [--states <value>]
          [--names <value>]
          [--owners <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --provider-types (list)
          List of provider types to use as a filter.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            CodeCommit
            GitHub
            Bitbucket
            GitHubEnterpriseServer
            S3Bucket

       --states (list)
          List of repository association states to use as a filter.

          The valid repository association states are:

          o Associated : The repository association is complete.

          o Associating : CodeGuru Reviewer is:

            o Setting up pull request notifications. This is required for pull
              requests to trigger a CodeGuru Reviewer review.

            NOTE:
                If your repository ProviderType is GitHub , GitHub  Enterprise
                Server  , or Bitbucket , CodeGuru Reviewer creates webhooks in
                your repository to trigger CodeGuru Reviewer reviews.  If  you
                delete these webhooks, reviews of code in your repository can-
                not be triggered.

            o Setting up source code access. This  is  required  for  CodeGuru
              Reviewer to securely clone code in your repository.

          o Failed : The repository failed to associate or disassociate.

          o Disassociating  :  CodeGuru  Reviewer is removing the repository's
            pull request notifications and source code access.

          o Disassociated : CodeGuru Reviewer successfully  disassociated  the
            repository.  You can create a new association with this repository
            if you want to review source code in it  later.  You  can  control
            access  to  code  reviews created in an associated repository with
            tags after it has been disassociated. For  more  information,  see
            Using  tags  to  control  access to associated repositories in the
            Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            Associated
            Associating
            Failed
            Disassociating
            Disassociated

       --names (list)
          List of repository names to use as a filter.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --owners (list)
          List of owners to use as a filter. For Amazon Web Services  CodeCom-
          mit, it is the name of the CodeCommit account that was used to asso-
          ciate the repository. For other repository source providers, such as
          Bitbucket  and GitHub Enterprise Server, this is name of the account
          that was used to associate the repository.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

                       Enterprise  Server  ,  or Bitbucket , CodeGuru Reviewer
                       creates webhooks in your repository to trigger CodeGuru
                       Reviewer reviews. If you delete these webhooks, reviews
                       of code in your repository cannot be triggered.

                   o Setting up source code access. This is required for Code-
                     Guru  Reviewer to securely clone code in your repository.

                 o Failed : The repository failed to associate  or  disassoci-
                   ate.

                 o Disassociating  : CodeGuru Reviewer is removing the reposi-
                   tory's pull request notifications and source code access.

                 o Disassociated : CodeGuru Reviewer  successfully  disassoci-
                   ated  the repository. You can create a new association with
                   this repository if you want to review  source  code  in  it
                   later. You can control access to code reviews created in an
                   associated repository with tags after it has been  disasso-
                   ciated.  For  more  information,  see Using tags to control
                   access to associated repositories in  the  Amazon  CodeGuru
                   Reviewer User Guide .

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  nextToken  value  to  include  in  a future ListRecommendations
          request. When the results of a  ListRecommendations  request  exceed
          maxResults  ,  this  value  can be used to retrieve the next page of
          results. This value is null  when  there  are  no  more  results  to
          return.
