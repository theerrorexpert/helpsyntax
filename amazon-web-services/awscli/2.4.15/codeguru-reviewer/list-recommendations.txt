DESCRIPTION
       Returns the list of all recommendations for a completed code review.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-recommendations
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          --code-review-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          Pagination token.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  results  that  are  returned per call. The
          default is 100.

       --code-review-arn (string)
          The   Amazon   Resource   Name   (ARN)   of   the    `    CodeReview
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-api/API_CodeReview.html`__
          object.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the recommendations for a completed code review

       The following list-recommendations example  lists  the  recommendations
       for a comleted code review. This code review has one recommendations.

OUTPUT
       RecommendationSummaries -> (list)
          List of recommendations for the requested code review.

          (structure)
              Information about recommendations.

              FilePath -> (string)
                 Name of the file on which a recommendation is provided.

              RecommendationId -> (string)
                 The  recommendation ID that can be used to track the provided
                 recommendations. Later on it can be used to collect the feed-
                 back.

              StartLine -> (integer)
                 Start line from where the recommendation is applicable in the
                 source commit or source branch.

              EndLine -> (integer)
                 Last line where  the  recommendation  is  applicable  in  the
                 source commit or source branch. For a single line comment the
                 start line and end line values are the same.

              Description -> (string)
                 A description of the  recommendation  generated  by  CodeGuru
                 Reviewer for the lines of code between the start line and the

                 Reviewer uses rules to analyze code. A rule's  recommendation
                 is included in analysis results if code is detected that vio-
                 lates the rule.
