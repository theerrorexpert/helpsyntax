NAME
       describe-repository-association -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns              a              `             RepositoryAssociation
       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-api/API_RepositoryAssociation.html`__
       object that contains information about the requested repository associ-
       ation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-repository-association
          --association-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --association-arn (string)
          The Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the  `  RepositoryAssociation
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-api/API_RepositoryAssociation.html`__
          object. You can retrieve this ARN by calling ` ListRepositoryAssoci-
          ations
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-api/API_ListRepositoryAssociations.html`__
          .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              in the Amazon Web Services CodeStar Connections API Reference  .

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the repository.

          Owner -> (string)
              The owner of the repository. For an Amazon Web Services CodeCom-
              mit repository, this is the Amazon Web Services  account  ID  of
              the  account  that  owns  the  repository.  For a GitHub, GitHub
              Enterprise Server, or Bitbucket repository, this is the username
              for  the account that owns the repository. For an S3 repository,
              it can be the username or Amazon Web Services account ID.

          ProviderType -> (string)
              The provider type of the repository association.

          State -> (string)
              The state of the repository association.

              The valid repository association states are:

              o Associated : The repository association is complete.

              o Associating : CodeGuru Reviewer is:

                o Setting up pull request notifications. This is required  for
                  pull requests to trigger a CodeGuru Reviewer review.

                NOTE:
                   If  your  repository ProviderType is GitHub , GitHub Enter-
                   prise Server , or Bitbucket  ,  CodeGuru  Reviewer  creates
                   webhooks  in  your  repository to trigger CodeGuru Reviewer
                   reviews. If you delete these webhooks, reviews of  code  in
                   your repository cannot be triggered.

                o Setting up source code access. This is required for CodeGuru
                  Reviewer to securely clone code in your repository.

              o Failed : The repository failed to associate or disassociate.

              o Disassociating : CodeGuru Reviewer  is  removing  the  reposi-
                tory's pull request notifications and source code access.

              o Disassociated  :  CodeGuru Reviewer successfully disassociated
                the repository. You can create a  new  association  with  this
                repository  if you want to review source code in it later. You
                can control access to code reviews created  in  an  associated
                repository with tags after it has been disassociated. For more
                information, see Using tags to control  access  to  associated
                repositories in the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide .

          StateReason -> (string)
              A  description  of why the repository association is in the cur-
              rent state.

          LastUpdatedTimeStamp -> (timestamp)
              The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when  the  repository
              association was last updated.

          CreatedTimeStamp -> (timestamp)
              The  time,  in milliseconds since the epoch, when the repository
              association was created.

              A KMSKeyDetails object that contains:

              o The encryption option for this repository association.  It  is
                either  owned  by  Amazon  Web Services Key Management Service
                (KMS) (AWS_OWNED_CMK  )  or  customer  managed  (CUSTOMER_MAN-
                AGED_CMK ).

              o The  ID  of the Amazon Web Services KMS key that is associated
                with this respository association.

              KMSKeyId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Amazon Web Services KMS key that is  associated
                 with a respository association.

              EncryptionOption -> (string)
                 The  encryption  option  for  a repository association. It is
                 either owned by Amazon Web Services  Key  Management  Service

          S3RepositoryDetails -> (structure)
              Specifies the name of an S3 bucket and  a  CodeArtifacts  object
              that contains the S3 object keys for a source code .zip file and

              files.

              BucketName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  S3  bucket  used for associating a new S3
                 repository. It must begin with codeguru-reviewer- .

              CodeArtifacts -> (structure)
                 A CodeArtifacts object. The CodeArtifacts object includes the
                 S3  object  key  for  a source code .zip file and for a build
                 artifacts .zip file that contains .jar or .class files.

                 SourceCodeArtifactsObjectKey -> (string)
                     The S3 object key for a source code .zip  file.  This  is
                     required for all code reviews.

                 BuildArtifactsObjectKey -> (string)
                     The  S3  object  key for a build artifacts .zip file that
                     contains .jar or .class files. This  is  required  for  a
                     code review with security analysis. For more information,
                     see Create code reviews with  security  analysis  in  the
                     Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide .

       Tags -> (map)
          An  array of key-value pairs used to tag an associated repository. A
          tag is a custom attribute label with two parts:

          o A tag key (for example, CostCenter , Environment ,  Project  ,  or
            Secret ). Tag keys are case sensitive.

          o An  optional field known as a tag value (for example, 111122223333
            , Production , or a team name). Omitting the tag value is the same
            as  using an empty string. Like tag keys, tag values are case sen-
            sitive.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)
