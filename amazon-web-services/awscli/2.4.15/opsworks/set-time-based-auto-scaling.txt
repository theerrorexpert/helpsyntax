       Shorthand Syntax:

          Monday={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string},Tuesday={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string},Wednesday={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string},Thursday={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string},Friday={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string},Saturday={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string},Sunday={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Monday": {"string": "string"
              ...},
            "Tuesday": {"string": "string"
              ...},
            "Wednesday": {"string": "string"
              ...},
            "Thursday": {"string": "string"
              ...},
            "Friday": {"string": "string"
              ...},
            "Saturday": {"string": "string"
              ...},
            "Sunday": {"string": "string"
              ...}
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To set the time-based scaling configuration for a layer

       The following example sets the time-based configuration for a specified
       instance.   You  must  first use create-instance to add the instance to
       the layer.

          aws opsworks --region us-east-1 set-time-based-auto-scaling --instance-id 69b6237c-08c0-4edb-a6af-78f3d01cedf2 --auto-scaling-schedule file://schedule.json

       The example puts the schedule in a separate file in the working  direc-
       tory  named  schedule.json.  For this example, the instance is on for a
       few hours around midday UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) on Monday  and
       Tuesday.

          {
            "Monday": {
              "10": "on",
              "11": "on",
              "12": "on",
              "13": "on"
            },
            "Tuesday": {
              "10": "on",
              "11": "on",
              "12": "on",
              "13": "on"
            }
          }

       Output: None.

OUTPUT
