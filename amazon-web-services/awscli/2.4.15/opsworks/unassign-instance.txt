UNASSIGN-INSTANCE()                                        UNASSIGN-INSTANCE()



NAME
       unassign-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Unassigns  a  registered  instance  from  all layers that are using the
       instance. The instance remains in the stack as an unassigned  instance,
       and  can  be  assigned  to another layer as needed. You cannot use this
       action with instances that were created with AWS OpsWorks Stacks.
          Required Permissions : To use this action, an IAM user must  have  a
          Manage  permissions  level  for the stack or an attached policy that
          explicitly grants permissions. For more information about user  per-
          missions, see Managing User Permissions .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            unassign-instance
          --instance-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The instance ID.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
