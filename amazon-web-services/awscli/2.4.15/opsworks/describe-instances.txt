NAME
       describe-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Requests a description of a set of instances.

       NOTE:
              This call accepts only one resource-identifying parameter.

          Required  Permissions  : To use this action, an IAM user must have a
          Show, Deploy, or Manage permissions  level  for  the  stack,  or  an
          attached  policy that explicitly grants permissions. For more infor-
          mation about user permissions, see Managing User Permissions .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-instances
          [--stack-id <value>]
          [--layer-id <value>]
          [--instance-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-id (string)
          A stack ID. If you use  this  parameter,  DescribeInstances  returns
          descriptions of the instances associated with the specified stack.

       --layer-id (string)
          A  layer  ID.  If  you use this parameter, DescribeInstances returns
          descriptions of the instances associated with the specified layer.

       --instance-ids (list)
          An array of instance IDs to be described. If you use this parameter,
          DescribeInstances  returns a description of the specified instances.
          Otherwise, it returns a description of every instance.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe instances

       The following describe-instances commmand describes the instances in  a
       specified stack:

          aws opsworks --region us-east-1 describe-instances --stack-id 8c428b08-a1a1-46ce-a5f8-feddc43771b8

       Output: The following output example is for a stack with two instances.
       The first is a registered EC2 instance, and the second was  created  by
       AWS OpsWorks.

                            size (in GiB) is 50:1. AWS uses the default volume
                            size (in GiB) specified in the AMI  attributes  to
                            set IOPS to 50 x (volume size).

                 the instance boots. The default value is true . If this value
                 is  set  to false , you must then update your instances manu-
                 ally by using  CreateDeployment to run  the  update_dependen-
                 cies  stack command or by manually running yum (Amazon Linux)
                 or apt-get (Ubuntu) on the instances.

                 NOTE:
                     We strongly recommend using the default value of  true  ,
                     to  ensure  that  your instances have the latest security
                     updates.
