NAME
       describe-apps -

DESCRIPTION
       Requests a description of a specified set of apps.

       NOTE:
              This call accepts only one resource-identifying parameter.

          Required  Permissions  : To use this action, an IAM user must have a
          Show, Deploy, or Manage permissions  level  for  the  stack,  or  an
          attached  policy that explicitly grants permissions. For more infor-
          mation about user permissions, see Managing User Permissions .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-apps
          [--stack-id <value>]
          [--app-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-id (string)
          The app stack ID. If you use this parameter, DescribeApps returns  a
          description of the apps in the specified stack.

       --app-ids (list)
          An  array  of  app IDs for the apps to be described. If you use this
          parameter, DescribeApps returns a description of the specified apps.
          Otherwise, it returns a description of every app.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

                     In  responses,  AWS  OpsWorks  Stacks  returns  *****FIL-

                 Revision -> (string)
                     The  application's  version.  AWS OpsWorks Stacks enables
                     you to easily deploy new versions of an application.  One
                     of  the  simplest approaches is to have branches or revi-
                     sions in your repository that  represent  different  ver-
                     sions that can potentially be deployed.

                 When the app was created.

              Environment -> (list)
                 An array of EnvironmentVariable objects that specify environ-
                 ment  variables  to  be  associated  with  the app. After you
                 deploy the app, these variables are defined on the associated
                 app  server  instances. For more information, see Environment
                 Variables .

                 NOTE:
                     There is no specific limit on the number  of  environment
                     variables.  However,  the  size  of  the  associated data
                     structure - which includes the  variable  names,  values,
                     and  protected  flag  values  - cannot exceed 20 KB. This
                     limit should accommodate most if not all use  cases,  but
                     if  you  do  exceed it, you will cause an exception (API)
                     with an "Environment: is too large (maximum  is  20  KB)"
                     message.

                 (structure)
                     Represents an app's environment variable.

                     Key -> (string)
                        (Required)  The environment variable's name, which can
                        consist of up to 64 characters and must be  specified.
                        The  name  can  contain  upper- and lowercase letters,
                        numbers, and underscores (_), but it must start with a
                        letter or underscore.

                     Value -> (string)
                        (Optional) The environment variable's value, which can
                        be left empty. If you specify a value, it can  contain
                        up to 256 characters, which must all be printable.

                     Secure -> (boolean)
                        (Optional)   Whether  the  variable's  value  will  be
                        returned by the  DescribeApps action.  To  conceal  an
                        environment  variable's  value,  set  Secure to true .
                        DescribeApps then returns  *****FILTERED*****  instead
                        of  the  actual value. The default value for Secure is
                        false .



                                                               DESCRIBE-APPS()
