NAME
       describe-load-based-auto-scaling -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  load-based auto scaling configurations for specified layers.

       NOTE:
              You must specify at least one of the parameters.

          Required Permissions : To use this action, an IAM user must  have  a
          Show,  Deploy,  or  Manage  permissions  level  for the stack, or an
          attached policy that explicitly grants permissions. For more  infor-
          mation about user permissions, see Managing User Permissions .

SYNOPSIS
            describe-load-based-auto-scaling
          --layer-ids <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --layer-ids (list)
          An array of layer IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe a layer's load-based scaling configuration

       The  following example describes a specified layer's load-based scaling
       configuration.  The layer is identified by its layer ID, which you  can
       find on the layer's details page or by running describe-layers.

          aws opsworks describe-load-based-auto-scaling --region us-east-1 --layer-ids 6bec29c9-c866-41a0-aba5-fa3e374ce2a1

       Output: The example layer has a single load-based instance.

          {
            "LoadBasedAutoScalingConfigurations": [
              {
                "DownScaling": {
                  "IgnoreMetricsTime": 10,
                  "ThresholdsWaitTime": 10,
                  "InstanceCount": 1,
                  "CpuThreshold": 30.0
                },
                "Enable": true,
                "UpScaling": {
                  "IgnoreMetricsTime": 5,
                  "ThresholdsWaitTime": 5,
                  "InstanceCount": 1,
                  "CpuThreshold": 80.0
                },
                "LayerId": "6bec29c9-c866-41a0-aba5-fa3e374ce2a1"
              }
            ]
          }

OUTPUT
       LoadBasedAutoScalingConfigurations -> (list)
          An array of LoadBasedAutoScalingConfiguration objects that  describe
          each layer's configuration.

          (structure)
              Describes a layer's load-based auto scaling configuration.

              LayerId -> (string)
                 The layer ID.

              Enable -> (boolean)
                 Whether load-based auto scaling is enabled for the layer.

              UpScaling -> (structure)
                 An  AutoScalingThresholds object that describes the upscaling
                 configuration, which defines how and when AWS OpsWorks Stacks
                 increases the number of instances.

                 InstanceCount -> (integer)
                     The  number  of  instances to add or remove when the load
                     exceeds a threshold.

                 ThresholdsWaitTime -> (integer)
                     The amount of time, in minutes, that the load must exceed
                     a threshold before more instances are added or removed.

                 IgnoreMetricsTime -> (integer)
                     The  amount  of  time  (in minutes) after a scaling event
                     occurs that AWS OpsWorks Stacks should ignore metrics and
                     suppress  additional  scaling  events.  For  example, AWS
                     OpsWorks Stacks adds new instances following an upscaling
                     event  but  the  instances  won't start reducing the load
                     until they have been booted and configured. There  is  no
                     point  in  raising  additional scaling events during that
                     operation, which typically takes several minutes. Ignore-
                     MetricsTime  allows  you to direct AWS OpsWorks Stacks to
                     suppress scaling  events  long  enough  to  get  the  new
                     instances online.

                 CpuThreshold -> (double)
                     The CPU utilization threshold, as a percent of the avail-
                     able CPU. A value of -1 disables the threshold.

                 MemoryThreshold -> (double)
                     The memory utilization threshold, as  a  percent  of  the
                     available memory. A value of -1 disables the threshold.

                 LoadThreshold -> (double)
                     The load threshold. A value of -1 disables the threshold.

                     (computing) .

                 Alarms -> (list)
                     Custom  Cloudwatch  auto  scaling  alarms,  to be used as
                     thresholds. This parameter takes a list  of  up  to  five
                     alarm  names, which are case sensitive and must be in the
                     same region as the stack.

                     NOTE:
                        To use custom alarms, you  must  update  your  service
                        role  to  allow  cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms  .  You can
                        either have AWS OpsWorks Stacks update  the  role  for
                        you  when  you  first use this feature or you can edit
                        the role manually. For more information, see  Allowing
                        AWS OpsWorks Stacks to Act on Your Behalf .

                     (string)

              DownScaling -> (structure)
                 An  AutoScalingThresholds object that describes the downscal-
                 ing configuration, which defines how and  when  AWS  OpsWorks
                 Stacks reduces the number of instances.

                 InstanceCount -> (integer)
                     The  number  of  instances to add or remove when the load
                     exceeds a threshold.

                 ThresholdsWaitTime -> (integer)
                     The amount of time, in minutes, that the load must exceed
                     a threshold before more instances are added or removed.

                     occurs that AWS OpsWorks Stacks should ignore metrics and
                     suppress  additional  scaling  events.  For  example, AWS
