DESCRIBE-LAYERS()                                            DESCRIBE-LAYERS()



NAME
       describe-layers -

DESCRIPTION
       Requests a description of one or more layers in a specified stack.

       NOTE:
              This call accepts only one resource-identifying parameter.

          Required  Permissions  : To use this action, an IAM user must have a
          Show, Deploy, or Manage permissions  level  for  the  stack,  or  an
          attached  policy that explicitly grants permissions. For more infor-
          mation about user permissions, see Managing User Permissions .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-layers
          [--stack-id <value>]
          [--layer-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-id (string)
          The stack ID.

       --layer-ids (list)
          An array of layer IDs that specify the layers to  be  described.  If
          you  omit  this  parameter,  DescribeLayers returns a description of
          every layer in the specified stack.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe a stack's layers

       The following describe-layers commmand describes the layers in a speci-
       fied stack:

          aws opsworks --region us-east-1 describe-layers --stack-id 38ee91e2-abdc-4208-a107-0b7168b3cc7a

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              CloudWatchLogsConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The Amazon CloudWatch Logs  configuration  settings  for  the
                 layer.

                     A list of configuration options for CloudWatch Logs.

                     (structure)
                        Describes the Amazon CloudWatch logs configuration for
                        a layer. For detailed  information  about  members  of
                        this  data  type, see the CloudWatch Logs Agent Refer-
                        ence .

                        LogGroupName -> (string)
                            Specifies the destination log group. A  log  group
                            is  created  automatically  if  it doesn't already
                            exist. Log group names can be between  1  and  512
                            characters  long.  Allowed characters include a-z,
                            A-Z, 0-9,  '_'  (underscore),  '-'  (hyphen),  '/'
                            (forward slash), and '.' (period).

                        DatetimeFormat -> (string)
                            Specifies  how  the  time  stamp is extracted from
                            logs. For more  information,  see  the  CloudWatch
                            Logs Agent Reference .

                        TimeZone -> (string)
                            Specifies  the time zone of log event time stamps.

                        File -> (string)
                            Specifies log files  that  you  want  to  push  to
                            CloudWatch Logs.
                               File  can  point to a specific file or multiple
                               files (by using wild card  characters  such  as
                               /var/log/system.log* ). Only the latest file is
                               pushed to CloudWatch Logs, based on file  modi-
                               fication  time.  We recommend that you use wild
                               card characters to specify a series of files of
                               the same type, such as access_log.2014-06-01-01
                               , access_log.2014-06-01-02 , and so on by using
                               a pattern like access_log.* . Don't use a wild-
                               card to match  multiple  file  types,  such  as
                               access_log_80  and  access_log_443 . To specify
                               multiple, different file types, add another log
                               stream entry to the configuration file, so that
                               each log file type is stored in a different log
                               group.

                            Zipped files are not supported.

                        FileFingerprintLines -> (string)

                            dash-delimited  numbers,  such  as '1', '2-5'. The
                            default value is '1', meaning the  first  line  is
                            used  to  calculate  the  fingerprint. Fingerprint
                            lines are not sent to CloudWatch Logs  unless  all

                        BatchSize -> (integer)
                            Specifies  the  maximum  size  of  log events in a

                            the sum of all event messages in  UTF-8,  plus  26
                            bytes for each log event.

              DefaultRecipes -> (structure)
                 AWS  OpsWorks  Stacks supports five lifecycle events: setup ,
                 configuration , deploy , undeploy , and shutdown .  For  each
                 layer, AWS OpsWorks Stacks runs a set of standard recipes for
                 each event. You can also provide custom recipes  for  any  or
                 all  layers and events. AWS OpsWorks Stacks runs custom event
                 recipes after the standard recipes. LayerCustomRecipes speci-
                 fies  the  custom recipes for a particular layer to be run in
                 response to each of the five events.

                 To specify a recipe, use the cookbook's directory name in the
                 repository  followed by two colons and the recipe name, which
                 is the recipe's file name  without  the  .rb  extension.  For

                 the repository's phpapp2 folder.

                 is  set  to false , you must then update your instances manu-
                 ally by using  CreateDeployment to run  the  update_dependen-
                 cies  stack command or manually running yum (Amazon Linux) or
