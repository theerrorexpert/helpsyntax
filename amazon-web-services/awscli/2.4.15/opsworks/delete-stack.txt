NAME
       delete-stack -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a specified stack. You must first delete all instances, layers,
       and apps or deregister registered instances. For more information,  see
       Shut Down a Stack .
          Required  Permissions  : To use this action, an IAM user must have a
          Manage permissions level for the stack, or an attached  policy  that
          explicitly  grants permissions. For more information on user permis-
          sions, see Managing User Permissions .

SYNOPSIS
            delete-stack
          --stack-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-id (string)
          The stack ID.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a stack

       The following example deletes a specified stack, which is identified by
       its  stack ID.  You can obtain a stack ID by clicking Stack Settings on
       the AWS OpsWorks console or by running the describe-stacks command.

       Note:   Before   deleting   a   layer,   you   must   use   delete-app,
       delete-instance,  and  delete-layer  to delete all of the stack's apps,
       instances, and layers.
