NAME
       describe-deployments -

DESCRIPTION
       Requests a description of a specified set of deployments.

       NOTE:
              This call accepts only one resource-identifying parameter.

          Required  Permissions  : To use this action, an IAM user must have a
          Show, Deploy, or Manage permissions  level  for  the  stack,  or  an
          attached  policy that explicitly grants permissions. For more infor-
          mation about user permissions, see Managing User Permissions .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-deployments
          [--stack-id <value>]
          [--app-id <value>]
          [--deployment-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-id (string)
          The stack ID. If you include this parameter, the command  returns  a
          description of the commands associated with the specified stack.

       --app-id (string)
          The  app  ID.  If  you include this parameter, the command returns a
          description of the commands associated with the specified app.

       --deployment-ids (list)
          An array of deployment IDs to be  described.  If  you  include  this
          parameter,  the  command  returns  a  description  of  the specified
          deployments. Otherwise, it returns a description  of  every  deploy-
          ment.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       The  following  describe-deployments commmand describes the deployments
       in a specified stack.

              Command -> (structure)
                 Used to specify a stack or deployment command.

                 Name -> (string)
                     Specifies  the  operation.  You can specify only one com-
                     mand.

                     For stacks, the following commands are available:

                     o execute_recipes : Execute one or more recipes. To spec-
                       ify the recipes, set an Args parameter named recipes to
                       the list of recipes to be  executed.  For  example,  to
                       execute     phpapp::appsetup     ,    set    Args    to
                       {"recipes":["phpapp::appsetup"]} .

                     o install_dependencies : Install  the  stack's  dependen-
                       cies.

                     o update_custom_cookbooks  :  Update  the  stack's custom
                       cookbooks.

                     o update_dependencies : Update the stack's  dependencies.

                     NOTE:
                        The  update_dependencies and install_dependencies com-
                        mands are supported only for Linux instances. You  can
                        run  the  commands  successfully on Windows instances,
                        but they do nothing.

                     For apps, the following commands are available:

                     o deploy : Deploy an app. Ruby  on  Rails  apps  have  an
                       optional  Args  parameter  named  migrate . Set Args to
                       {"migrate":["true"]}  to  migrate  the  database.   The
                       default setting is {"migrate":["false"]}.

                     o rollback  Roll  the  app  back to the previous version.
                       When you update an app, AWS OpsWorks Stacks stores  the
                       previous version, up to a maximum of five versions. You
                       can use this command to roll an app  back  as  many  as
                       four versions.

                     o start : Start the app's web or application server.

                     o stop : Stop the app's web or application server.

                     o restart  : Restart the app's web or application server.

                     o undeploy : Undeploy the app.

                 Args -> (map)
                     The arguments of those commands that take  arguments.  It
                     should be set to a JSON object with the following format:
                        {"arg_name1" : ["value1", "value2", ...],  "arg_name2"
                        : ["value1", "value2", ...], ...}

                     The update_dependencies command takes two arguments:

                     o upgrade_os_to - Specifies the desired Amazon Linux ver-
                       sion for instances whose OS you want to  upgrade,  such
                       as  Amazon  Linux  2016.09  .  You  must  also  set the
                       allow_reboot argument to true.

                     o allow_reboot - Specifies whether to allow AWS  OpsWorks
                       Stacks  to  reboot  the  instances  if necessary, after
                       installing the updates. This argument  can  be  set  to
                       either true or false . The default value is false .

                     For  example,  to  upgrade  an  instance  to Amazon Linux
                     2016.09, set Args to the following.
                        {    "upgrade_os_to":["Amazon     Linux     2016.09"],
                        "allow_reboot":["true"] }

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (list)
                        (string)

              Status -> (string)
                 The deployment status:

                 o running

                 o successful

                 o failed

              CustomJson -> (string)
                 A  string  that  contains user-defined custom JSON. It can be
                 used to override the corresponding default  stack  configura-
                 tion  attribute  values for stack or to pass data to recipes.
                 The string should be in the following format:
                     "{\"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": \"value2\",...}"

                 For more information on custom JSON, see Use Custom  JSON  to
                 Modify the Stack Configuration Attributes .

              InstanceIds -> (list)
                 The IDs of the target instances.

                 (string)
