REGISTER()                                                          REGISTER()



NAME
       register -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers an EC2 instance or machine with AWS OpsWorks.

       Registering  a machine using this command will install the AWS OpsWorks
       agent on the target machine and register it with an  existing  OpsWorks
       stack.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            register
          --stack-id <value>
          --infrastructure-class <value>
          [--override-hostname <value>]
          [--override-private-ip <value>]
          [--override-public-ip <value>]
          [--override-ssh <value>]
          [--ssh-username <value>]
          [--ssh-private-key <value>]
          [--local]
          [--use-instance-profile]
          [<target>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-id  (string)  A  stack ID. The instance will be registered with
       the given stack.

       --infrastructure-class (string) Specifies whether to  register  an  EC2
       instance (ec2) or an on-premises instance (on-premises).

       --override-hostname  (string)  The  instance hostname. If not provided,
       the current hostname of the machine will be used.

       --override-private-ip (string) An IP address. If you set  this  parame-
       ter, the given IP address will be used as the private IP address within
       OpsWorks. Otherwise the private IP address will be determined automati-
       cally. Not to be used with EC2 instances.

       --override-public-ip (string) An IP address. If you set this parameter,
       the given IP address will be used  as  the  public  IP  address  within
       OpsWorks.  Otherwise the public IP address will be determined automati-
       cally. Not to be used with EC2 instances.

       --override-ssh (string) If you set this parameter,  the  given  command
       will be used to connect to the machine.

       --ssh-username (string) If provided, this username will be used to con-
       nect to the host.

       --ssh-private-key (string) If provided, the given private key file will
       be used to connect to the machine.

       --local  (boolean)  If  given,  instead  of a remote machine, the local
       machine will be imported. Cannot be used together with target.

       --use-instance-profile (boolean) Use the instance  profile  instead  of
       creating an IAM user.

       target  (string)  Either  the  EC2  instance  ID or the hostname of the
       instance or machine to be registered  with  OpsWorks.  Cannot  be  used
       together with --local.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To register instances with a stack

       The  following  examples  show  a variety of ways to register instances
       with a stack that were created outside of AWS Opsworks.   You  can  run
       register  from  the instance to be registered, or from a separate work-
       station.   For  more  information,  see  Registering  Amazon  EC2   and
       On-premises Instances in the AWS OpsWorks User Guide.

       Note: For brevity, the examples omit the region argument.

       To register an Amazon EC2 instance

       To  indicate that you are registering an EC2 instance, set the --infra-
       structure-class argument to ec2.

       The following example registers an  EC2  instance  with  the  specified
       stack  from  a separate workstation.  The instance is identified by its
       EC2 ID, i-12345678. The example  uses  the  workstation's  default  SSH
       username  and  attempts  to log in to the instance using authentication
       techniques that do not require a password, such as  a  default  private
       SSH key. If that fails, register queries for the password.

          aws opsworks register --infrastructure-class=ec2 --stack-id 935450cc-61e0-4b03-a3e0-160ac817d2bb i-12345678

       The following example registers an EC2 instance with the specifed stack
       from a separate workstation.  It uses the --ssh-username and --ssh-pri-
       vate-key  arguments  to explicitly specify the SSH username and private
       key file that the command uses to log into the instance.   ec2-user  is
       the standard username for Amazon Linux instances. Use ubuntu for Ubuntu
       instances.

          aws opsworks register --infrastructure-class=ec2 --stack-id 935450cc-61e0-4b03-a3e0-160ac817d2bb --ssh-username ec2-user --ssh-private-key ssh_private_key i-12345678

       The following example registers the EC2 instance that  is  running  the
       register  command.   Log  in  to the instance with SSH and run register
       with the --local argument instead of an instance ID or hostname.

          aws opsworks register --infrastructure-class ec2 --stack-id 935450cc-61e0-4b03-a3e0-160ac817d2bb --local

       To register an on-premises instance

       To indicate that you are registering an on-premises instance,  set  the
       --infrastructure-class argument to on-premises.

       The following example registers an existing on-premises instance with a
       specified stack from a separate workstation.  The instance  is  identi-
       fied  by  its IP address, 192.0.2.3. The example uses the workstation's
       default SSH username and attempts to  log  in  to  the  instance  using
       authentication  techniques  that  do  not require a password, such as a
       default private SSH key. If that fails, register queries for the  pass-
       word.

          aws opsworks register --infrastructure-class on-premises --stack-id 935450cc-61e0-4b03-a3e0-160ac817d2bb 192.0.2.3

       The  following  example registers an on-premises instance with a speci-
       fied stack from a separate workstation.  The instance is identified  by
       its  hostname,  host1. The --override-... arguments direct AWS OpsWorks
       to display webserver1 as the host name and 192.0.2.3  and  10.0.0.2  as
       the instance's public and private IP addresses, respectively.

          aws opsworks register --infrastructure-class on-premises --stack-id 935450cc-61e0-4b03-a3e0-160ac817d2bb --override-hostname webserver1 --override-public-ip 192.0.2.3 --override-private-ip 10.0.0.2 host1

       The  following  example registers an on-premises instance with a speci-
       fied stack from a separate workstation.  The instance is identified  by
       its IP address. register logs into the instance using the specified SSH
       username and private key file.

          aws opsworks register --infrastructure-class on-premises --stack-id 935450cc-61e0-4b03-a3e0-160ac817d2bb --ssh-username admin --ssh-private-key ssh_private_key 192.0.2.3

       The following example registers an existing on-premises instance with a
       specified stack from a separate workstation.  The command logs into the
       instance using a custom SSH command string that specifies the SSH pass-
       word and the instance's IP address.

          aws opsworks register --infrastructure-class on-premises --stack-id 935450cc-61e0-4b03-a3e0-160ac817d2bb --override-ssh "sshpass -p 'mypassword' ssh your-user@192.0.2.3"

       The  following  example registers the on-premises instance that is run-
       ning the register command.  Log in to the instance  with  SSH  and  run
       register  with  the --local argument instead of an instance ID or host-
       name.

          aws opsworks register --infrastructure-class on-premises --stack-id 935450cc-61e0-4b03-a3e0-160ac817d2bb --local

       Output:  The  following  is  typical  output  for  registering  an  EC2
       instance.
