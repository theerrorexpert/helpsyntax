DESCRIPTION
       Updates an uploaded test spec.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-upload
          --arn <value>
          [--name <value>]
          [--content-type <value>]
          [--edit-content | --no-edit-content]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the uploaded test spec.

       --name (string)
          The upload's test spec file name. The name must not contain any for-
          ward slashes (/). The test spec file name must end with the .yaml or
          .yml file extension.

       --content-type (string)
          The upload's content type (for example, application/x-yaml ).

       --edit-content | --no-edit-content (boolean)
          Set to true if the YAML file has changed and must be updated. Other-
          wise, set to false.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
