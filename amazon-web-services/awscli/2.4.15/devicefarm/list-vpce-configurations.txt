LIST-VPCE-CONFIGURATIONS()                          LIST-VPCE-CONFIGURATIONS()



NAME
       list-vpce-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about all Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) end-
       point configurations in the AWS account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-vpce-configurations is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: vpceConfigurations

SYNOPSIS
            list-vpce-configurations
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       vpceConfigurations -> (list)
          An array of VPCEConfiguration objects that contain information about
          your VPC endpoint configuration.

          (structure)
              Represents  an  Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) endpoint con-
              figuration.

              arn -> (string)

              vpceConfigurationName -> (string)
                 The friendly name you give to your VPC endpoint configuration
                 to manage your configurations more easily.

              vpceServiceName -> (string)
                 The name of the VPC endpoint  service  running  in  your  AWS
                 account that you want Device Farm to test.

              serviceDnsName -> (string)
                 The  DNS name that maps to the private IP address of the ser-

                 An optional description that provides details about your  VPC
                 endpoint configuration.

       nextToken -> (string)
          An identifier that was returned from the previous call to this oper-
          ation, which can be used to return the next  set  of  items  in  the
