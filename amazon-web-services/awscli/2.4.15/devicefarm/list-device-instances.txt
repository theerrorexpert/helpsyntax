LIST-DEVICE-INSTANCES()                                LIST-DEVICE-INSTANCES()



NAME
       list-device-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about the private device instances associated with
       one or more AWS accounts.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-device-instances is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: deviceInstances

SYNOPSIS
            list-device-instances
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       deviceInstances -> (list)
          An object that contains information about your device instances.

          (structure)
              Represents the device instance.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the device instance.

              deviceArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the device.

              labels -> (list)
                 An array of strings that describe the device instance.

                 (string)

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the device instance. Valid  values  are  listed
                 here.

              udid -> (string)
                 Unique device identifier for the device instance.

              instanceProfile -> (structure)
                 A  object  that  contains information about the instance pro-
                 file.

                 arn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance profile.

                 packageCleanup -> (boolean)
                     When set to true , Device Farm removes app packages after
                     a  test  run.  The  default  value  is  false for private
                     devices.

                 excludeAppPackagesFromCleanup -> (list)
                     An array of strings containing the list of  app  packages
                     that  should  not  be  cleaned up from the device after a
                     test run completes.

                     The list of packages is considered only if you set  pack-
                     ageCleanup to true .

                     (string)

                 rebootAfterUse -> (boolean)
                     When set to true , Device Farm reboots the instance after
                     a test run. The default value is true .

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of the instance profile.

                 description -> (string)
                     The description of the instance profile.

       nextToken -> (string)
          An identifier that can be used in the next call to this operation to
          return the next set of items in the list.
