NAME
       list-devices -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about unique device types.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-devices is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: devices

SYNOPSIS
            list-devices
          [--arn <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the project.

       --filters (list)
          Used to select a  set  of  devices.  A  filter  is  made  up  of  an
          attribute, an operator, and one or more values.

          o Attribute:  The  aspect of a device such as platform or model used
            as the selection criteria  in  a  device  filter.  Allowed  values
            include:

            o ARN:  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the device (for example,
              arn:aws:devicefarm:us-west-2::device:12345Example ).

            o PLATFORM: The device platform. Valid values are ANDROID or  IOS.

            o OS_VERSION:  The operating system version (for example, 10.3.2).

            o MODEL: The device model (for example, iPad 5th Gen).

            o AVAILABILITY: The current availability of the device. Valid val-
              ues   are   AVAILABLE,   HIGHLY_AVAILABLE,   BUSY,   or   TEMPO-
              RARY_NOT_AVAILABLE.

            o FORM_FACTOR: The device form factor. Valid values are  PHONE  or
              TABLET.

            o MANUFACTURER: The device manufacturer (for example, Apple).

            o REMOTE_ACCESS_ENABLED:  Whether the device is enabled for remote
              access. Valid values are TRUE or FALSE.

            o REMOTE_DEBUG_ENABLED: Whether the device is enabled  for  remote
              debugging. Valid values are TRUE or FALSE. Because remote debug-
              ging is no longer supported , this attribute is ignored.

            o INSTANCE_ARN: The Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the  device
              instance.

            o INSTANCE_LABELS: The label of the device instance.

            o FLEET_TYPE:  The fleet type. Valid values are PUBLIC or PRIVATE.

          o Operator: The filter operator.

            o The EQUALS operator is  available  for  every  attribute  except
              INSTANCE_LABELS.

            o The  CONTAINS  operator is available for the INSTANCE_LABELS and
              MODEL attributes.

            o The IN and NOT_IN operators are available for the  ARN,  OS_VER-
              SION, MODEL, MANUFACTURER, and INSTANCE_ARN attributes.

            o The    LESS_THAN,    GREATER_THAN,    LESS_THAN_OR_EQUALS,   and
              GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUALS operators  are  also  available  for  the
              OS_VERSION attribute.

          o Values: An array of one or more filter values.

            o The  IN and NOT_IN operators take a values array that has one or
              more elements.

            o The other operators require an array with a single element.

            o In a request, the AVAILABILITY  attribute  takes  the  following
              values:    AVAILABLE,    HIGHLY_AVAILABLE,   BUSY,   or   TEMPO-
              RARY_NOT_AVAILABLE.

          (structure)
              Represents a device filter used to select a set of devices to be
              included  in a test run. This data structure is passed in as the
              deviceSelectionConfiguration parameter to ScheduleRun .  For  an
              example of the JSON request syntax, see  ScheduleRun .

              It  is  also passed in as the filters parameter to ListDevices .
              For an example of the JSON request syntax, see  ListDevices .

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attribute=string,operator=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "attribute": "ARN"|"PLATFORM"|"OS_VERSION"|"MODEL"|"AVAILABILITY"|"FORM_FACTOR"|"MANUFACTURER"|"REMOTE_ACCESS_ENABLED"|"REMOTE_DEBUG_ENABLED"|"INSTANCE_ARN"|"INSTANCE_LABELS"|"FLEET_TYPE",
              "operator": "EQUALS"|"LESS_THAN"|"LESS_THAN_OR_EQUALS"|"GREATER_THAN"|"GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUALS"|"IN"|"NOT_IN"|"CONTAINS",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
