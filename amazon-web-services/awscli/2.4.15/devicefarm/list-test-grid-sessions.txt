SYNOPSIS
            list-test-grid-sessions
          --project-arn <value>
          [--status <value>]
          [--creation-time-after <value>]
          [--creation-time-before <value>]
          [--end-time-after <value>]
          [--end-time-before <value>]
          [--max-result <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --project-arn (string)
          ARN of a  TestGridProject .

       --status (string)
          Return only sessions in this state.

          Possible values:

          o ACTIVE

          o CLOSED

          o ERRORED

       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          Return only sessions created after this time.

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          Return only sessions created before this time.

       --end-time-after (timestamp)
          Return only sessions that ended after this time.

       --end-time-before (timestamp)
          Return only sessions that ended before this time.

       --max-result (integer)
          Return only this many results at a time.

       --next-token (string)
          Pagination token.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
