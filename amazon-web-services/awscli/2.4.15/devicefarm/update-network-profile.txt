OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the project for which you want to
          update network profile settings.

       --name (string)
          The name of the network profile about which you are returning infor-
          mation.

       --description (string)
          The description of the network profile about which you are returning
          information.

       --type (string)
          The type of network profile to return information about. Valid  val-
          ues are listed here.

          Possible values:

          o CURATED

          o PRIVATE

       --uplink-bandwidth-bits (long)
          The data throughput rate in bits per second, as an integer from 0 to
          104857600.

       --downlink-bandwidth-bits (long)
          The data throughput rate in bits per second, as an integer from 0 to
          104857600.

       --uplink-delay-ms (long)
          Delay  time  for  all  packets  to destination in milliseconds as an
          integer from 0 to 2000.

       --downlink-delay-ms (long)
          Delay time for all packets to  destination  in  milliseconds  as  an
          integer from 0 to 2000.

       --uplink-jitter-ms (long)
          Time  variation  in the delay of received packets in milliseconds as
          an integer from 0 to 2000.

       --downlink-jitter-ms (long)
          Time variation in the delay of received packets in  milliseconds  as
          an integer from 0 to 2000.

       --uplink-loss-percent (integer)
          Proportion  of transmitted packets that fail to arrive from 0 to 100
          percent.

       --downlink-loss-percent (integer)
          Proportion of received packets that fail to arrive  from  0  to  100
          percent.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
