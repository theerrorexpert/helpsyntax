          testPackageArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the uploaded test to be run.

          testSpecArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the YAML-formatted test specification.

          filter -> (string)
              The test's filter.

          parameters -> (map)
              The  test's  parameters,  such  as test framework parameters and
              fixture settings. Parameters are represented by name-value pairs
              of strings.

              For all tests:

              o app_performance_monitoring : Performance monitoring is enabled
                by default. Set this parameter to false to disable it.

              For Calabash tests:

              o profile: A cucumber profile (for example, my_profile_name ).

              o tags: You can limit execution to features  or  scenarios  that
                have  (or  don't  have)  certain  tags (for example, @smoke or
                @smoke,~@wip).

              For Appium tests (all types):

              o appium_version: The Appium version. Currently supported values
                are 1.6.5 (and later), latest, and default.

                o latest  runs  the  latest Appium version supported by Device
                  Farm (1.9.1).

                o For default, Device Farm selects  a  compatible  version  of
                  Appium  for the device. The current behavior is to run 1.7.2
                  on Android devices and iOS 9 and earlier and 1.7.2  for  iOS
                  10 and later.

                o This behavior is subject to change.

              For fuzz tests (Android only):

              o event_count:  The  number of events, between 1 and 10000, that
                the UI fuzz test should perform.

              o throttle: The time, in ms, between 0 and  1000,  that  the  UI
                fuzz test should wait between events.

              o seed:  A  seed  to use for randomizing the UI fuzz test. Using
                the same seed value  between  tests  ensures  identical  event
                sequences.

              For Explorer tests:

              o username:  A  user  name  to  use if the Explorer encounters a
                login form. If not supplied, no user name is inserted.

              o password: A password to use if the Explorer encounters a login
                form. If not supplied, no password is inserted.

              For Instrumentation:

              o filter: A test filter string. Examples:

                o Running a single test case: com.android.abc.Test1

                o Running a single test: com.android.abc.Test1#smoke

                o Running                    multiple                   tests:
                  com.android.abc.Test1,com.android.abc.Test2

              For XCTest and XCTestUI:

              o filter: A test filter string. Examples:

                o Running a single test class: LoginTests

                o Running a multiple test classes: LoginTests,SmokeTests

                o Running a single test: LoginTests/testValid

                o Running    multiple    tests:    LoginTests/testValid,Login-
                  Tests/testInvalid

              For UIAutomator:

              o filter: A test filter string. Examples:

                o Running a single test case: com.android.abc.Test1

                o Running a single test: com.android.abc.Test1#smoke

                o Running                    multiple                   tests:

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
