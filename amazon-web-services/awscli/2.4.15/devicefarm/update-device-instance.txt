NAME
       update-device-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates information about a private device instance.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-device-instance
          --arn <value>
          [--profile-arn <value>]
          [--labels <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the device instance.

       --profile-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of  the profile that you want to associate with the device
          instance.

       --labels (list)
          An array of strings that you  want  to  associate  with  the  device
          instance.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       deviceInstance -> (structure)
          An object that contains information about your device instance.

          arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the device instance.

          deviceArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the device.

          labels -> (list)
              An array of strings that describe the device instance.

              (string)

          status -> (string)
              The status of the device instance. Valid values are listed here.

          udid -> (string)
              Unique device identifier for the device instance.

          instanceProfile -> (structure)
              A object that contains information about the instance profile.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance profile.

              packageCleanup -> (boolean)
                 When set to true , Device Farm removes app packages  after  a
                 test run. The default value is false for private devices.

              excludeAppPackagesFromCleanup -> (list)
                 An  array of strings containing the list of app packages that
                 should not be cleaned up from the device  after  a  test  run
                 completes.

                 The  list  of packages is considered only if you set package-
                 Cleanup to true .

                 (string)

              rebootAfterUse -> (boolean)
                 When set to true , Device Farm reboots the instance  after  a
                 test run. The default value is true .

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the instance profile.

              description -> (string)
                 The description of the instance profile.
