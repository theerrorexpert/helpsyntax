UPDATE-DEVICE-POOL()                                      UPDATE-DEVICE-POOL()



NAME
       update-device-pool -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  the  name,  description, and rules in a device pool given the
       attributes and the pool ARN. Rule updates are  all-or-nothing,  meaning
       they can only be updated as a whole (or not at all).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-device-pool
          --arn <value>
          [--name <value>]
          [--description <value>]
          [--rules <value>]
          [--max-devices <value>]
          [--clear-max-devices | --no-clear-max-devices]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the Device Farm device pool to
          update.

       --name (string)
          A string that represents the name of the device pool to update.

       --description (string)
          A description of the device pool to update.

       --rules (list)
          Represents the rules to modify for the device pool.  Updating  rules
          is  optional.  If  you  update  rules  for  your request, the update
          replaces the existing rules.

          (structure)
              Represents a condition for a device pool.

              attribute -> (string)
                 The rule's stringified attribute. For  example,  specify  the
                 value as "\"abc\"" .

                 The  supported  operators  for each attribute are provided in

                 attribute, see the attribute descriptions.

              value -> (string)
                 The rule's value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attribute=string,operator=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "attribute": "ARN"|"PLATFORM"|"FORM_FACTOR"|"MANUFACTURER"|"REMOTE_ACCESS_ENABLED"|"REMOTE_DEBUG_ENABLED"|"APPIUM_VERSION"|"INSTANCE_ARN"|"INSTANCE_LABELS"|"FLEET_TYPE"|"OS_VERSION"|"MODEL"|"AVAILABILITY",
              "operator": "EQUALS"|"LESS_THAN"|"LESS_THAN_OR_EQUALS"|"GREATER_THAN"|"GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUALS"|"IN"|"NOT_IN"|"CONTAINS",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-devices (integer)
          The number of devices that Device Farm can add to your device  pool.
          Device Farm adds devices that are available and that meet the crite-
          ria that you assign for the rules parameter. Depending on  how  many
          devices meet these constraints, your device pool might contain fewer
          devices than the value for this parameter.

          By specifying the maximum number of devices,  you  can  control  the
          costs that you incur by running tests.

          If you use this parameter in your request, you cannot use the clear-
          MaxDevices parameter in the same request.

       --clear-max-devices | --no-clear-max-devices (boolean)
          Sets whether the maxDevices parameter applies to your  device  pool.
          If  you  set  this parameter to true , the maxDevices parameter does
          not apply, and Device Farm does not limit the number of devices that
          it  adds  to  your  device  pool. In this case, Device Farm adds all
          available devices that meet the  criteria  specified  in  the  rules
          parameter.

          If you use this parameter in your request, you cannot use the maxDe-
          vices parameter in the same request.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
