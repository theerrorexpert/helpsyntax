LIST-CONNECTIONS()                                          LIST-CONNECTIONS()



NAME
       list-connections -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list of App Runner connections that are associated with your
       Amazon Web Services account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-connections
          [--connection-name <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --connection-name (string)
          If specified, only this connection is returned.  If  not  specified,
          the result isn't filtered by name.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of results to include in each response (result
          page). Used for a paginated request.

          If you don't specify MaxResults , the request retrieves  all  avail-
          able results in a single response.

       --next-token (string)
          A  token  from a previous result page. Used for a paginated request.
          The request retrieves the next result page. All other parameter val-
          ues  must be identical to the ones specified in the initial request.

          If you don't specify NextToken , the  request  retrieves  the  first
          result page.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To list all connections

       The following list-connections example lists all App Runner connections
       in the AWS account.

          aws apprunner list-connections

       Output:

          {
              "ConnectionSummaryList": [
                  {
                      "ConnectionArn": "arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:123456789012:connection/my-github-connection",
                      "ConnectionName": "my-github-connection",
                      "Status": "AVAILABLE",
                      "CreatedAt": "2020-11-03T00:32:51Z",
                      "ProviderType": "GITHUB"
                  },
                  {
                      "ConnectionArn": "arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:123456789012:connection/my-github-org-connection",
                      "ConnectionName": "my-github-org-connection",
                      "Status": "AVAILABLE",
                      "CreatedAt": "2020-11-03T02:54:17Z",
                      "ProviderType": "GITHUB"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Example 2: To list a connection by name

       The following list-connections example lists a connection by its  name.

          aws apprunner list-connections \
              --cli-input-json file://input.json

       Contents of input.json:

          {
              "ConnectionName": "my-github-org-connection"
          }

       Output:

          {
              "ConnectionSummaryList": [
                  {
                      "ConnectionArn": "arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:123456789012:connection/my-github-org-connection",
                      "ConnectionName": "my-github-org-connection",
                      "Status": "AVAILABLE",
                      "CreatedAt": "2020-11-03T02:54:17Z",
                      "ProviderType": "GITHUB"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       ConnectionSummaryList -> (list)
          A  list  of  summary information records for connections. In a pagi-
          nated request, the request returns up to MaxResults records for each
          call.

          (structure)
              Provides  summary  information  about  an  App Runner connection
              resource.

              ConnectionName -> (string)
                 The customer-provided connection name.

              ConnectionArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this connection.

              ProviderType -> (string)
                 The source repository provider.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current state of the  App  Runner  connection.  When  the
                 state  is AVAILABLE , you can use the connection to create an
                 App Runner service.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The App Runner connection creation time, expressed as a  Unix
                 time stamp.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token that you can pass in a subsequent request to get the next
          result page. Returned in a paginated request.
