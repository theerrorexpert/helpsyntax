DISASSOCIATE-CUSTOM-DOMAIN()                      DISASSOCIATE-CUSTOM-DOMAIN()



NAME
       disassociate-custom-domain -

DESCRIPTION
       Disassociate a custom domain name from an App Runner service.

       Certificates  tracking  domain  validity  are  associated with a custom
       domain and are stored in AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) . These certifi-
       cates aren't deleted as part of this action. App Runner delays certifi-
       cate deletion for 30 days after a domain  is  disassociated  from  your
       service.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disassociate-custom-domain
          --service-arn <value>
          --domain-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --service-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the App Runner service that you
          want to disassociate a custom domain name from.

       --domain-name (string)
          The domain name that you want to disassociate from  the  App  Runner
          service.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To disassociate a domain name from a service

       The  following  disassociate-custom-domain  example  disassociates  the
       domain example.com from an App Runner service.  The call also  disasso-
       ciates  the subdomain www.example.com that was associated together with
       the root domain.

OUTPUT
       DNSTarget -> (string)

          ated custom domain name was mapped to this target name.

       ServiceArn -> (string)

       CustomDomain -> (structure)
          A description of the domain name that's being disassociated.

          DomainName -> (string)
              An associated custom domain endpoint. It can be  a  root  domain
