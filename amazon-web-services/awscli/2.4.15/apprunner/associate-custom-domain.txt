ASSOCIATE-CUSTOM-DOMAIN()                            ASSOCIATE-CUSTOM-DOMAIN()



NAME
       associate-custom-domain -

DESCRIPTION
       Associate  your  own  domain  name with the App Runner subdomain URL of
       your App Runner service.

       After you call AssociateCustomDomain and receive a successful response,
       use  the information in the  CustomDomain record that's returned to add
       CNAME records to your Domain Name System (DNS). For each mapped  domain
       name,  add a mapping to the target App Runner subdomain and one or more
       certificate validation records. App Runner then performs DNS validation
       to  verify that you own or control the domain name that you associated.
       App Runner tracks domain validity in a certificate stored in  AWS  Cer-
       tificate Manager (ACM) .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            associate-custom-domain
          --service-arn <value>
          --domain-name <value>
          [--enable-www-subdomain | --no-enable-www-subdomain]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --service-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the App Runner service that you
          want to associate a custom domain name with.

       --domain-name (string)
          A custom domain endpoint to associate. Specify a  root  domain  (for
          example,  example.com ), a subdomain (for example, login.example.com
          or admin.login.example.com ), or a wildcard  (for  example,  *.exam-
          ple.com ).

       --enable-www-subdomain | --no-enable-www-subdomain (boolean)
          Set to true to associate the subdomain
          ``
          www.*DomainName*  ``  with the App Runner service in addition to the
          base domain.

          Default: true

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To associate a domain name and the www subdomain with a service

       The  following  associate-custom-domain  example  associates  a  custom
       domain  name  that  you control with an App Runner service.  The domain
       name is the root domain example.com, including the special-case  subdo-
       main www.example.com.
