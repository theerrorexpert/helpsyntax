START-DEPLOYMENT()                                          START-DEPLOYMENT()



NAME
       start-deployment -

DESCRIPTION
       Initiate  a  manual  deployment  of  the latest commit in a source code
       repository or the latest image in a source image repository to  an  App
       Runner service.

       For  a  source  code  repository,  App  Runner retrieves the commit and
       builds a Docker image.  For  a  source  image  repository,  App  Runner
       retrieves  the  latest  Docker  image.  In  both cases, App Runner then
       deploys the new image to  your  service  and  starts  a  new  container
       instance.

       This  is  an  asynchronous operation. On a successful call, you can use
       the returned OperationId and the   ListOperations  call  to  track  the
       operation's progress.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-deployment
          --service-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --service-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the App Runner service that you
          want to manually deploy to.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To initiate a manual deployment

       The following start-deployment example performs a manual deployment  to
       an App Runner service.

          aws apprunner start-deployment \
              --cli-input-json file://input.json

       Contents of input.json:

          {
              "ServiceArn": "arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:123456789012:service/python-app/8fe1e10304f84fd2b0df550fe98a71fa"
          }

       Output:

          {
              "OperationId": "853a7d5b-fc9f-4730-831b-fd8037ab832a"
          }

OUTPUT
       OperationId -> (string)
          The  unique  ID  of  the  asynchronous  operation  that this request
          started. You can use it combined with the   ListOperations  call  to
          track the operation's progress.
