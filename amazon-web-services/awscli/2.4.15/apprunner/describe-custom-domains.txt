DESCRIBE-CUSTOM-DOMAINS()                            DESCRIBE-CUSTOM-DOMAINS()



NAME
       describe-custom-domains -

DESCRIPTION
       Return a description of custom domain names that are associated with an
       App Runner service.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-custom-domains
          --service-arn <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --service-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the App Runner  service  that  you
          want associated custom domain names to be described for.

       --next-token (string)
          A  token  from  a  previous  result  page. It's used for a paginated
          request. The request retrieves  the  next  result  page.  All  other
          parameter values must be identical to the ones that are specified in
          the initial request.

          If you don't specify NextToken , the  request  retrieves  the  first
          result page.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number of results that each response (result page) can
          include. It's used for a paginated request.

          If you don't specify MaxResults , the request retrieves  all  avail-
          able results in a single response.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       tus of the custom domain names associated with an App Runner service.

OUTPUT
       DNSTarget -> (string)

              service.

              DomainName -> (string)
                 An associated custom domain endpoint. It can be a root domain
                 (for  example,  example.com  ),  a  subdomain  (for  example,
                 login.example.com or admin.login.example.com ), or a wildcard

              EnableWWWSubdomain -> (boolean)
                 When true , the subdomain
                 ``
                 www.*DomainName* `` is associated with the App Runner service
                 in addition to the base domain.

              CertificateValidationRecords -> (list)
                 A  list  of  certificate  CNAME  records that's used for this
                 domain name.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a certificate CNAME record to add to your  DNS.
                     For more information, see AssociateCustomDomain .

                     Name -> (string)
                        The certificate CNAME record name.

                     Type -> (string)

                        The certificate CNAME record value.

                     Status -> (string)
                        The current state of the certificate CNAME record val-
                        idation. It should change to SUCCESS after App  Runner
                        completes validation with your DNS.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current state of the domain name association.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token that you can pass in a subsequent request to get the next
          result page. It's returned in a paginated request.
