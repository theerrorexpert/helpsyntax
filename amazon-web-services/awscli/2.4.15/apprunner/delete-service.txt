DELETE-SERVICE()                                              DELETE-SERVICE()



NAME
       delete-service -

DESCRIPTION
       Delete an App Runner service.

       This  is  an  asynchronous operation. On a successful call, you can use
       the returned OperationId and the   ListOperations  call  to  track  the
       operation's progress.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-service
          --service-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --service-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the App Runner service that you
          want to delete.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Service -> (structure)
          A description of the App  Runner  service  that  this  request  just
          deleted.

          ServiceName -> (string)
              The customer-provided service name.

          ServiceId -> (string)
              An  ID  that  App Runner generated for this service. It's unique
              within the Amazon Web Services Region.

          ServiceArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this service.

          ServiceUrl -> (string)
              A subdomain URL that App Runner generated for this service.  You
              can use this URL to access your service web application.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The  time  when  the App Runner service was created. It's in the
              Unix time stamp format.

          UpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The time when the App Runner service was last updated  at.  It's
              in the Unix time stamp format.

          DeletedAt -> (timestamp)
              The  time  when  the App Runner service was deleted. It's in the
              Unix time stamp format.

          Status -> (string)
              The current state of the App Runner  service.  These  particular
              values mean the following.

              o CREATE_FAILED   The  service failed to create. To troubleshoot
                this failure, read the failure events  and  logs,  change  any
                parameters that need to be fixed, and retry the call to create
                the service. The failed service isn't usable, and still counts
                towards  your  service  quota.  When you're done analyzing the
                failure, delete the service.

              o DELETE_FAILED  The service failed to delete and can't be  suc-
                cessfully recovered. Retry the service deletion call to ensure
                that all related resources are removed.

          SourceConfiguration -> (structure)
              The source deployed to the App Runner service. It can be a  code
              or an image repository.

              CodeRepository -> (structure)
                 The description of a source code repository.

                 You  must  provide either this member or ImageRepository (but
                 not both).

                 RepositoryUrl -> (string)
                     The location of the repository that contains  the  source
                     code.

                 SourceCodeVersion -> (structure)
                     The  version  that  should be used within the source code
                     repository.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The type of version identifier.

                        For a git-based repository,  branches  represent  ver-
                        sions.

                     Value -> (string)
                        A source code version.

                        For  a  git-based  repository, a branch name maps to a
                        specific version. App Runner uses the most recent com-
                        mit to the branch.

                 CodeConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Configuration for building and running the service from a
                     source code repository.

                     ConfigurationSource -> (string)
                        The source of the App Runner configuration. Values are
                        interpreted as follows:

                        o REPOSITORY   App  Runner  reads configuration values
                          from the apprunner.yaml  file  in  the  source  code
                          repository and ignores CodeConfigurationValues .

                        o API   App  Runner uses configuration values provided
                          in CodeConfigurationValues and ignores  the  apprun-
                          ner.yaml file in the source code repository.

                     CodeConfigurationValues -> (structure)
                        The  basic  configuration for building and running the
                        App Runner service. Use it to quickly  launch  an  App
                        Runner service without providing a apprunner.yaml file
                        in the source code repository (or ignoring the file if
                        it exists).

                        Runtime -> (string)
                            A  runtime  environment type for building and run-
                            ning an App Runner service. It represents  a  pro-
                            gramming language runtime.

                        BuildCommand -> (string)

                            your  running  App  Runner  service.  An  array of
                            key-value pairs. Keys with a prefix of  AWSAPPRUN-
                            NER  are reserved for system use and aren't valid.

                            key -> (string)

              ImageRepository -> (structure)
                 The description of a source image repository.

                 You must provide either this member  or  CodeRepository  (but
                 not both).

                 ImageIdentifier -> (string)
                     The identifier of an image.

                     For an image in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon
                     ECR), this is an image name. For the image  name  format,
                     see Pulling an image in the Amazon ECR User Guide .

                 ImageConfiguration -> (structure)

                        Environment  variables that are available to your run-
                        ning App Runner service. An array of key-value  pairs.
                        Keys  with  a  prefix of AWSAPPRUNNER are reserved for
                        system use and aren't valid.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (string)

                     StartCommand -> (string)
                        An optional command that App Runner runs to start  the
                        application  in  the  source image. If specified, this
                        command overrides the Docker images default start com-
                        mand.

                     Port -> (string)
                        The  port that your application listens to in the con-
                        tainer.

                        Default: 8080

                 ImageRepositoryType -> (string)
                     The type of  the  image  repository.  This  reflects  the
                     repository provider and whether the repository is private
                     or public.

              AutoDeploymentsEnabled -> (boolean)
                 If true , continuous integration from the  source  repository
                 is enabled for the App Runner service. Each repository change
                 (including any source  code  commit  or  new  image  version)
                 starts a deployment.

                 Default:  App  Runner  sets  to false for a source image that
                 uses an ECR Public repository or an ECR repository that's  in
                 an  Amazon  Web  Services account other than the one that the
                 service is in. App Runner sets to true  in  all  other  cases
                 (which currently include a source code repository or a source
                 image using a same-account ECR repository).

              AuthenticationConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Describes the  resources  that  are  needed  to  authenticate
                 access to some source repositories.

                 ConnectionArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the App Runner connec-
                     tion that enables the App Runner service to connect to  a
                     source  repository. It's required for GitHub code reposi-
                     tories.

                 AccessRoleArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the  IAM  role  that
                     grants  the App Runner service access to a source reposi-
                     tory. It's required for ECR image repositories  (but  not
                     for ECR Public repositories).

          InstanceConfiguration -> (structure)
              The  runtime  configuration of instances (scaling units) of this
              service.

              Cpu -> (string)
                 The number of CPU units reserved for each  instance  of  your
                 App Runner service.

                 Default: 1 vCPU

              Memory -> (string)
                 The amount of memory, in MB or GB, reserved for each instance
                 of your App Runner service.

                 Default: 2 GB

              InstanceRoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role  that  provides
                 permissions to your App Runner service. These are permissions
                 that your code needs when it calls any  Amazon  Web  Services
                 APIs.

          EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
              The  encryption  key that App Runner uses to encrypt the service
              logs and the copy of the source repository that App Runner main-
              tains  for  the  service.  It  can be either a customer-provided
              encryption key or an Amazon Web Services managed CMK.

              KmsKey -> (string)
                 The ARN of the KMS key that's used for encryption.

          HealthCheckConfiguration -> (structure)
              The settings for the health check that App  Runner  performs  to
              monitor the health of this service.

              Protocol -> (string)
                 The IP protocol that App Runner uses to perform health checks
                 for your service.

                 If you set Protocol to HTTP , App Runner sends  health  check
                 requests to the HTTP path specified by Path .

                 Default: TCP

              Path -> (string)
                 The URL that health check requests are sent to.
                     Path is only applicable when you set Protocol to HTTP .

                 Default: "/"

              Interval -> (integer)
                 The time interval, in seconds, between health checks.

                 Default: 5

              Timeout -> (integer)
                 The  time,  in  seconds,  to wait for a health check response
                 before deciding it failed.

                 Default: 2

              HealthyThreshold -> (integer)
                 The number of consecutive checks that must succeed before App
                 Runner decides that the service is healthy.
