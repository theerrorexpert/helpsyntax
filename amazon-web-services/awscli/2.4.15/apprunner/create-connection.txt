CREATE-CONNECTION()                                        CREATE-CONNECTION()



NAME
       create-connection -

DESCRIPTION
       Create an App Runner connection resource. App Runner requires a connec-
       tion resource when you create App Runner services that  access  private
       repositories  from  certain third-party providers. You can share a con-
       nection across multiple services.

       A connection resource is needed to access GitHub  repositories.  GitHub
       requires  a user interface approval process through the App Runner con-
       sole before you can use the connection.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-connection
          --connection-name <value>
          --provider-type <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --connection-name (string)
          A name for the new connection. It must be unique across all App Run-
          ner  connections  for  the Amazon Web Services account in the Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --provider-type (string)
          The source repository provider.

          Possible values:

          o GITHUB

       --tags (list)
          A list of metadata items that you can associate with your connection
          resource. A tag is a key-value pair.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag that is applied to an App Runner resource. A tag
              is a metadata item consisting of a key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a GitHub connection

       The following create-connection example creates a connection to a  pri-
       vate  GitHub  code repository. The connection status after a successful
       call is PENDING_HANDSHAKE. This is because an authentication  handshake
       with  the  provider still hasn't happened. Complete the handshake using
       the App Runner console.

          aws apprunner create-connection \
              --cli-input-json file://input.json

       Contents of input.json:

          {
              "ConnectionName": "my-github-connection",
              "ProviderType": "GITHUB"
          }

       Output:

          {
              "Connection": {
                  "ConnectionArn": "arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:123456789012:connection/my-github-connection",
                  "ConnectionName": "my-github-connection",
                  "Status": "PENDING_HANDSHAKE",
                  "CreatedAt": "2020-11-03T00:32:51Z",
                  "ProviderType": "GITHUB"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       Connection -> (structure)
          A  description  of  the App Runner connection that's created by this
          request.

          ConnectionName -> (string)
              The customer-provided connection name.

          ConnectionArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this connection.

          ProviderType -> (string)
              The source repository provider.

          Status -> (string)
              The current state of the App Runner connection. When  the  state
              is  AVAILABLE , you can use the connection to create an App Run-
              ner service.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The App Runner connection creation time,  expressed  as  a  Unix
              time stamp.
