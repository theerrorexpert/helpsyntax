NAME
       describe-auto-scaling-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Return a full description of an App Runner automatic scaling configura-
       tion resource.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-auto-scaling-configuration
          --auto-scaling-configuration-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --auto-scaling-configuration-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the App Runner auto  scaling  con-
          figuration that you want a description for.

          The  ARN  can be a full auto scaling configuration ARN, or a partial
          ARN ending with either
          ``
          .../name `` or
          ``
          .../name /revision `` . If a revision isn't  specified,  the  latest
          active revision is described.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example  1:  To  describe the latest active revision of an auto scaling
       configuration

       The  following  describe-auto-scaling-configuration  example   gets   a
       description of the latest active revision of an App Runner auto scaling
       configuration. To describe the latest active revision, specify  an  ARN
       that  ends with the configuration name, without the revision component.

       In the example, two revisions exist. Therefore, revision 2 (the latest)
       is described. The resulting object shows "Latest": true.

          }

       Output:

          {
              "AutoScalingConfiguration": {
                  "AutoScalingConfigurationArn": "arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:123456789012:autoscalingconfiguration/high-availability/2/e76562f50d78042e819fead0f59672e6",
                  "AutoScalingConfigurationName": "high-availability",
                  "AutoScalingConfigurationRevision": 2,
                  "CreatedAt": "2021-02-25T17:42:59Z",
                  "Latest": true,
                  "Status": "ACTIVE",
                  "MaxConcurrency": 30,

                  "MinSize": 5
              }
          }

       Example  2: To describe a specific revision of an auto scaling configu-
       ration

       The  following  describe-auto-scaling-configuration   example   get   a
       description  of  a specific revision of an App Runner auto scaling con-
       figuration. To describe  a  specific  revision,  specify  an  ARN  that
       includes the revision number.

       In  the example, several revisions exist and revision 1 is queried. The
       resulting object shows "Latest": false.

          aws apprunner describe-auto-scaling-configuration \
              --cli-input-json file://input.json

       Contents of input.json:

          {
              "AutoScalingConfigurationArn": "arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:123456789012:autoscalingconfiguration/high-availability/1"
          }

       Output:

          {
              "AutoScalingConfiguration": {
                  "AutoScalingConfigurationArn": "arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:123456789012:autoscalingconfiguration/high-availability/1/2f50e7656d7819fead0f59672e68042e",

                  "Latest": false,
                  "Status": "ACTIVE",
                  "MaxConcurrency": 100,
                  "MaxSize": 50,
                  "MinSize": 5
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       AutoScalingConfiguration -> (structure)
          A full description of the App Runner auto scaling configuration that
          you specified in this request.

          AutoScalingConfigurationArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of this auto scaling configura-
              tion.

          AutoScalingConfigurationName -> (string)
              The customer-provided auto scaling configuration name. It can be
              used in multiple revisions of a configuration.

          AutoScalingConfigurationRevision -> (integer)
              The  revision  of  this  auto scaling configuration. It's unique
              among all the active configurations ("Status": "ACTIVE"  )  that
              share the same AutoScalingConfigurationName .

          Latest -> (boolean)
              It's set to true for the configuration with the highest Revision
              among all configurations that share the same Name . It's set  to
              false otherwise.

          Status -> (string)
              The current state of the auto scaling configuration. If the sta-
              tus of a configuration revision is INACTIVE , it was deleted and
              can't  be used. Inactive configuration revisions are permanently
              removed some time after they are deleted.

          MaxConcurrency -> (integer)
              The maximum number of concurrent requests that an instance  pro-
              cesses. If the number of concurrent requests exceeds this limit,
              App Runner scales the service up.

          MinSize -> (integer)
              The minimum number of instances that App Runner provisions for a
              service.  The  service  always  has at least MinSize provisioned
              instances. Some of them actively serve traffic. The rest of them
              (provisioned  and  inactive instances) are a cost-effective com-
              pute capacity reserve and are ready to be quickly activated. You
              pay  for  memory usage of all the provisioned instances. You pay
              for CPU usage of only the active subset.

              App  Runner  temporarily  doubles  the  number  of   provisioned
              instances  during deployments, to maintain the same capacity for
              both old and new code.

          MaxSize -> (integer)
              The maximum number of instances that a service scales up to.  At
              most  MaxSize instances actively serve traffic for your service.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The time when the auto scaling configuration was  created.  It's
              in Unix time stamp format.

          DeletedAt -> (timestamp)
              The  time  when the auto scaling configuration was deleted. It's
              in Unix time stamp format.
