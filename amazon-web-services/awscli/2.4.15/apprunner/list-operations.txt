LIST-OPERATIONS()                                            LIST-OPERATIONS()



NAME
       list-operations -

DESCRIPTION
       Return a list of operations that occurred on an App Runner service.

       The  resulting  list  of  OperationSummary objects is sorted in reverse
       chronological order. The first object on the list represents  the  last
       started operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-operations
          --service-arn <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --service-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the App Runner service that you
          want a list of operations for.

       --next-token (string)
          A token from a previous result  page.  It's  used  for  a  paginated
          request.  The  request  retrieves  the  next  result page. All other
          parameter values must be identical to the ones specified in the ini-
          tial request.

          If  you  don't  specify  NextToken , the request retrieves the first
          result page.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to include in  each  response  (result
          page). It's used for a paginated request.

          If  you  don't specify MaxResults , the request retrieves all avail-
          able results in a single response.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list operations that occurred on a servicee

       The  following  list-operations  example  lists  all  operations   that
       occurred on an App Runner service so far.  In this example, the service
       is new and only a single operation of type CREATE_SERVICE has occurred.

          aws apprunner list-operations \
              --cli-input-json file://input.json

       Contents of input.json:

          {
              "ServiceArn": "arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:123456789012:service/python-app/8fe1e10304f84fd2b0df550fe98a71fa"
          }

       Output:

          {
              "OperationSummaryList": [
                  {
                      "EndedAt": 1606156217,
                      "Id": "17fe9f55-7e91-4097-b243-fcabbb69a4cf",
                      "StartedAt": 1606156014,
                      "Status": "SUCCEEDED",
                      "TargetArn": "arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:123456789012:service/python-app/8fe1e10304f84fd2b0df550fe98a71fa",
                      "Type": "CREATE_SERVICE",
                      "UpdatedAt": 1606156217
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       OperationSummaryList -> (list)
          A  list  of  operation  summary  information records. In a paginated
          request, the request returns up to MaxResults records for each call.

          (structure)
              Provides  summary  information for an operation that occurred on
              an App Runner service.

              Id -> (string)
                 A unique ID of this operation. It's unique in  the  scope  of
                 the App Runner service.

              Type -> (string)
                 The  type  of  operation. It indicates a specific action that
                 occured.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current state of the operation.

              TargetArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource that the oper-
                 ation acted on (for example, an App Runner service).

              StartedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  when  the operation started. It's in the Unix time
                 stamp format.

              EndedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the operation ended.  It's  in  the  Unix  time
                 stamp format.

              UpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  when  the  operation was last updated. It's in the
                 Unix time stamp format.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token that you can pass in a subsequent request to get the  next
          result page. It's returned in a paginated request.
