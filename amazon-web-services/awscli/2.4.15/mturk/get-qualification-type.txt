GET-QUALIFICATION-TYPE()                              GET-QUALIFICATION-TYPE()



NAME
       get-qualification-type -

DESCRIPTION
       The GetQualificationType operation retrieves information about a Quali-
       fication type using its ID.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-qualification-type
          --qualification-type-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --qualification-type-id (string)
          The ID of the QualificationType.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       QualificationType -> (structure)
          The returned Qualification Type

          QualificationTypeId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the Qualification type. A  Qualification
              type  is given a Qualification type ID when you call the Create-
              QualificationType operation.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time the Qualification type was created.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the Qualification type. The type  name  is  used  to
              identify  the  type,  and to find the type using a Qualification
              type search.

          Description -> (string)
              A long description for the Qualification type.

          Keywords -> (string)
              One or more words  or  phrases  that  describe  theQualification
              type,  separated by commas. The Keywords make the type easier to
              find using a search.

          QualificationTypeStatus -> (string)
              The status of the Qualification  type.  A  Qualification  type's
              status  determines if users can apply to receive a Qualification
              of this type, and if HITs can be created with requirements based
              on this type. Valid values are Active | Inactive.

          Test -> (string)
              The  questions  for  a  Qualification  test associated with this
              Qualification type that a user can take to obtain  a  Qualifica-
              tion of this type. This parameter must be specified if AnswerKey
              is present. A Qualification type cannot have  both  a  specified
              Test parameter and an AutoGranted value of true.

          TestDurationInSeconds -> (long)
              The  amount  of  time, in seconds, given to a Worker to complete
              the Qualification test,  beginning  from  the  time  the  Worker
              requests the Qualification.

          AnswerKey -> (string)
              The  answers  to  the  Qualification  test specified in the Test
              parameter.

          RetryDelayInSeconds -> (long)
              The amount of time, in seconds, Workers must wait  after  taking
              the  Qualification  test  before they can take it again. Workers
              can take a Qualification test multiple times if  they  were  not
              granted  the  Qualification  from  a previous attempt, or if the
              test offers a gradient score and they want a  better  score.  If
              not  specified,  retries  are disabled and Workers can request a
              Qualification only once.

          IsRequestable -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether the Qualification type is one that a user  can
              request  through the Amazon Mechanical Turk web site, such as by
              taking a Qualification test. This value is False for  Qualifica-
              tions  assigned  automatically  by  the system. Valid values are
              True | False.

          AutoGranted -> (boolean)
              Specifies that requests for the Qualification type  are  granted
              immediately,  without  prompting the Worker with a Qualification
              test. Valid values are True | False.

          AutoGrantedValue -> (integer)
              The Qualification integer value to use for automatically granted
              Qualifications, if AutoGranted is true. This is 1 by default.
