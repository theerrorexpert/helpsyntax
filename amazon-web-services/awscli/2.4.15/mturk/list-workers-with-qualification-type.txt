NAME
       list-workers-with-qualification-type -

DESCRIPTION
       The ListWorkersWithQualificationType operation returns all of the Work-
       ers that have been associated with a given Qualification type.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-workers-with-qualification-type is a paginated operation. Multiple
       API  calls  may  be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: Qualifications

SYNOPSIS
            list-workers-with-qualification-type
          --qualification-type-id <value>
          [--status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --qualification-type-id (string)
          The ID of the Qualification type of the Qualifications to return.

       --status (string)
          The status of the Qualifications to return. Can be Granted | Revoked
          .

          Possible values:

          o Granted

          o Revoked

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the previous response was incomplete (because there is more data
          to retrieve), Amazon Mechanical Turk returns a pagination  token  in
          the response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve the next
          set of results.

       NumResults -> (integer)
          The number of Qualifications on this page in  the  filtered  results
          list,  equivalent  to the number of Qualifications being returned by
          this call.

       Qualifications -> (list)
          The list of Qualification elements returned by this call.

          (structure)
              The Qualification  data  structure  represents  a  Qualification
              assigned  to  a  user,  including the Qualification type and the
              value (score).

              QualificationTypeId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Qualification type for the Qualification.

              WorkerId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Worker who possesses the Qualification.

              GrantTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and  time  the  Qualification  was  granted  to  the
                 Worker.  If  the Worker's Qualification was revoked, and then
                 re-granted based on a new Qualification request, GrantTime is
                 the  date  and  time of the last call to the AcceptQualifica-
                 tionRequest operation.

              IntegerValue -> (integer)
                 The value (score) of the Qualification, if the  Qualification
                 has an integer value.

              LocaleValue -> (structure)
                 The Locale data structure represents a geographical region or
                 location.

                 Country -> (string)
                     The country of the locale. Must be a valid ISO 3166 coun-
                     try  code.  For example, the code US refers to the United

                 Subdivision -> (string)
                     The state or subdivision  of  the  locale.  A  valid  ISO
                     3166-2  subdivision code. For example, the code WA refers
                     to the state of Washington.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the Qualification. Valid values are  Granted  |
