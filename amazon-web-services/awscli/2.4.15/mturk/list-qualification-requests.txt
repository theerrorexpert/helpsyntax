LIST-QUALIFICATION-REQUESTS()                    LIST-QUALIFICATION-REQUESTS()



NAME
       list-qualification-requests -

DESCRIPTION
       The ListQualificationRequests operation retrieves requests for Qualifi-
       cations of a particular Qualification type. The owner of the Qualifica-
       tion  type  calls  this  operation  to  poll  for pending requests, and
       accepts them using the AcceptQualification operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-qualification-requests is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: QualificationRequests

SYNOPSIS
            list-qualification-requests
          [--qualification-type-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --qualification-type-id (string)
          The ID of the QualificationType.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NumResults -> (integer)
          The number of Qualification requests on this page  in  the  filtered
          results  list,  equivalent  to  the number of Qualification requests
          being returned by this call.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the previous response was incomplete (because there is more  data
          to  retrieve),  Amazon Mechanical Turk returns a pagination token in
          the response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve the next
          set of results.

       QualificationRequests -> (list)
          The  Qualification request. The response includes one Qualification-
          Request element for  each  Qualification  request  returned  by  the
          query.

          (structure)
              The  QualificationRequest  data structure represents a request a
              Worker has made for a Qualification.

              QualificationRequestId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Qualification request, a unique identifier gen-
                 erated when the request was submitted.

              QualificationTypeId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Qualification type the Worker is requesting, as
                 returned by the CreateQualificationType operation.

              WorkerId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Worker requesting the Qualification.

              Test -> (string)
                 The contents of the Qualification test that was presented  to
                 the Worker, if the type has a test and the Worker has submit-
                 ted answers. This value  is  identical  to  the  QuestionForm
                 associated with the Qualification type at the time the Worker
                 requests the Qualification.

              Answer -> (string)
                 The Worker's answers for the Qualification type's  test  con-
                 tained  in  a QuestionFormAnswers document, if the type has a
                 test and the Worker has submitted answers. If the Worker does
                 not provide any answers, Answer may be empty.

              SubmitTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and time the Qualification request had a status of
                 Submitted. This is  either  the  time  the  Worker  submitted
                 answers  for  a  Qualification  test,  or the time the Worker
                 requested the Qualification if the  Qualification  type  does
                 not have a test.
