DELETE-QUALIFICATION-TYPE()                        DELETE-QUALIFICATION-TYPE()



NAME
       delete-qualification-type -

DESCRIPTION
       The  DeleteQualificationType  deletes  a Qualification type and deletes
       any HIT types that are associated with the Qualification type.

       This operation does not revoke Qualifications already assigned to Work-
       ers  because  the  Qualifications  might  be needed for active HITs. If
       there are any pending  requests  for  the  Qualification  type,  Amazon
       Mechanical  Turk  rejects those requests. After you delete a Qualifica-
       tion type, you can no longer use it to create HITs or HIT types.

       NOTE:
          DeleteQualificationType must wait for all  the  HITs  that  use  the
          deleted  Qualification  type to be deleted before completing. It may
          take up to 48 hours before DeleteQualificationType completes and the
          unique  name  of  the Qualification type is available for reuse with
          CreateQualificationType.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-qualification-type
          --qualification-type-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --qualification-type-id (string)
          The ID of the QualificationType to dispose.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
