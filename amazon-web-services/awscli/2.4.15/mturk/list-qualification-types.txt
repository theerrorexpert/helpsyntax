LIST-QUALIFICATION-TYPES()                          LIST-QUALIFICATION-TYPES()



NAME
       list-qualification-types -

DESCRIPTION
       The  ListQualificationTypes  operation  returns a list of Qualification
       types, filtered by an optional search term.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-qualification-types is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: QualificationTypes

SYNOPSIS
            list-qualification-types
          --must-be-requestable | --no-must-be-requestable
          [--must-be-owned-by-caller | --no-must-be-owned-by-caller]
          [--types-query <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --must-be-requestable | --no-must-be-requestable (boolean)
          Specifies  that  only  Qualification  types  that a user can request
          through the Amazon Mechanical Turk web site, such  as  by  taking  a
          Qualification  test,  are  returned  as  results of the search. Some
          Qualification types, such as those  assigned  automatically  by  the
          system,  cannot be requested directly by users. If false, all Quali-
          fication types, including those managed by the system,  are  consid-
          ered. Valid values are True | False.

       --must-be-owned-by-caller | --no-must-be-owned-by-caller (boolean)
          Specifies  that  only Qualification types that the Requester created
          are returned. If false,  the  operation  returns  all  Qualification
          types.

       --types-query (string)
          A  text query against all of the searchable attributes of Qualifica-
          tion types.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NumResults -> (integer)
          The  number  of  Qualification  types  on  this page in the filtered
          results list, equivalent to  the  number  of  types  this  operation
          returns.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the previous response was incomplete (because there is more data
          to retrieve), Amazon Mechanical Turk returns a pagination  token  in
          the response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve the next
          set of results.

       QualificationTypes -> (list)
          The list of QualificationType elements returned by the query.

          (structure)
              The QualificationType data structure represents a  Qualification
              type,  a  description  of a property of a Worker that must match
              the requirements of a HIT for the Worker to be  able  to  accept
              the HIT. The type also describes how a Worker can obtain a Qual-
              ification of that type, such as through a Qualification test.

              QualificationTypeId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the Qualification type. A  Qualifica-
                 tion  type is given a Qualification type ID when you call the
                 CreateQualificationType operation.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the Qualification type was created.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the Qualification type. The type name is used  to
                 identify the type, and to find the type using a Qualification
                 type search.

              Description -> (string)
                 A long description for the Qualification type.

              Keywords -> (string)
                 One or more words or phrases that  describe  theQualification
                 type,  separated by commas. The Keywords make the type easier
                 to find using a search.

              QualificationTypeStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the Qualification type. A Qualification  type's
                 status  determines if users can apply to receive a Qualifica-
                 tion of this type, and if HITs can be created  with  require-
                 ments based on this type. Valid values are Active | Inactive.

              Test -> (string)
                 The questions for a Qualification test associated  with  this
                 Qualification  type that a user can take to obtain a Qualifi-
                 cation of this type. This  parameter  must  be  specified  if
                 AnswerKey is present. A Qualification type cannot have both a
                 specified Test parameter and an AutoGranted value of true.

              TestDurationInSeconds -> (long)
                 The amount of time, in seconds, given to a Worker to complete
                 the  Qualification  test,  beginning from the time the Worker
                 requests the Qualification.

              AnswerKey -> (string)
                 The answers to the Qualification test specified in  the  Test
                 parameter.

              RetryDelayInSeconds -> (long)
                 The  amount of time, in seconds, Workers must wait after tak-
                 ing the Qualification test before they  can  take  it  again.
                 Workers  can take a Qualification test multiple times if they
                 were not granted the Qualification from a  previous  attempt,
                 or if the test offers a gradient score and they want a better
                 score. If not specified, retries are disabled and Workers can
                 request a Qualification only once.

              IsRequestable -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether  the Qualification type is one that a user
                 can request through the Amazon Mechanical Turk web site, such
                 as  by  taking  a Qualification test. This value is False for
                 Qualifications assigned automatically by  the  system.  Valid
                 values are True | False.

              AutoGranted -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  that  requests  for  the  Qualification  type  are
                 granted immediately, without  prompting  the  Worker  with  a
                 Qualification test. Valid values are True | False.

              AutoGrantedValue -> (integer)
                 The  Qualification  integer  value  to  use for automatically
                 granted Qualifications, if AutoGranted is true. This is 1  by
                 default.
