NOTIFY-WORKERS()                                              NOTIFY-WORKERS()



NAME
       notify-workers -

DESCRIPTION
       The  NotifyWorkers operation sends an email to one or more Workers that
       you specify with the Worker ID. You can specify up to 100 Worker IDs to
       send  the  same  message with a single call to the NotifyWorkers opera-
       tion. The NotifyWorkers operation will send a notification email  to  a
       Worker  only  if you have previously approved or rejected work from the
       Worker.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            notify-workers
          --subject <value>
          --message-text <value>
          --worker-ids <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subject (string)
          The subject line of the email message to send. Can include up to 200
          characters.

       --message-text (string)
          The text of the email message to send. Can include up to 4,096 char-
          acters

       --worker-ids (list)
          A list of Worker IDs you wish to notify. You  can  notify  upto  100
          Workers at a time.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NotifyWorkersFailureStatuses -> (list)
          When  MTurk  sends  notifications to the list of Workers, it returns
          back any failures it encounters in this list  of  NotifyWorkersFail-
          ureStatus objects.

          (structure)
              When  MTurk  encounters  an issue with notifying the Workers you
              specified, it returns back this object with failure details.

              NotifyWorkersFailureCode -> (string)
                 Encoded value for the failure type.

              NotifyWorkersFailureMessage -> (string)
                 A message detailing the reason the Worker could not be  noti-
                 fied.

              WorkerId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Worker.
