NAME
       associate-qualification-with-worker -

DESCRIPTION
       The  AssociateQualificationWithWorker operation gives a Worker a Quali-
       fication. AssociateQualificationWithWorker does not  require  that  the
       Worker  submit  a  Qualification  request.  It  gives the Qualification
       directly to the Worker.

       You can only assign a Qualification of a Qualification  type  that  you
       created (using the CreateQualificationType operation).

       NOTE:
          Note:  AssociateQualificationWithWorker  does not affect any pending
          Qualification requests for the Qualification by the Worker.  If  you
          assign a Qualification to a Worker, then later grant a Qualification
          request made by the Worker, the granting of the request  may  modify
          the  Qualification score. To resolve a pending Qualification request
          without affecting the Qualification the Worker already  has,  reject
          the request with the RejectQualificationRequest operation.

SYNOPSIS
            associate-qualification-with-worker
          --qualification-type-id <value>
          --worker-id <value>
          [--integer-value <value>]
          [--send-notification | --no-send-notification]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --qualification-type-id (string)
          The  ID of the Qualification type to use for the assigned Qualifica-
          tion.

       --worker-id (string)
          The ID of the Worker to whom the Qualification  is  being  assigned.
          Worker  IDs are included with submitted HIT assignments and Qualifi-
          cation requests.

       --integer-value (integer)
          The value of the Qualification to assign.

       --send-notification | --no-send-notification (boolean)
          Specifies whether to send a notification email message to the Worker
          saying that the qualification was assigned to the Worker. Note: this
          is true by default.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
