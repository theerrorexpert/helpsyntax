UPDATE-QUALIFICATION-TYPE()                        UPDATE-QUALIFICATION-TYPE()



NAME
       update-qualification-type -

DESCRIPTION
       The  UpdateQualificationType  operation  modifies  the attributes of an
       existing Qualification type, which is represented by  a  Qualification-
       Type  data structure. Only the owner of a Qualification type can modify
       its attributes.

       Most attributes of a Qualification type can be changed after  the  type
       has been created. However, the Name and Keywords fields cannot be modi-
       fied. The RetryDelayInSeconds parameter can be  modified  or  added  to
       change  the  delay or to enable retries, but RetryDelayInSeconds cannot
       be used to disable retries.

       You can use this operation to update the test for a Qualification type.
       The test is updated based on the values specified for the Test, TestDu-
       rationInSeconds and AnswerKey parameters. All three parameters  specify
       the  updated  test.  If  you are updating the test for a type, you must
       specify the Test and TestDurationInSeconds  parameters.  The  AnswerKey
       parameter is optional; omitting it specifies that the updated test does
       not have an answer key.

       If you omit the Test parameter, the test for the Qualification type  is
       unchanged.  There  is no way to remove a test from a Qualification type
       that has one. If the type already has a test, you cannot update  it  to
       be  AutoGranted. If the Qualification type does not have a test and one
       is provided by an update, the type will henceforth have a test.

       If you want to update the test duration or answer key for  an  existing
       test  without changing the questions, you must specify a Test parameter
       with the original questions, along with the updated values.

       If you provide an updated Test but no AnswerKey, the new test will  not
       have  an  answer  key. Requests for such Qualifications must be granted
       manually.

       You can also update the AutoGranted and AutoGrantedValue attributes  of
       the Qualification type.

OPTIONS
       --qualification-type-id (string)
          The ID of the Qualification type to update.

       --description (string)
          The new description of the Qualification type.

       --qualification-type-status (string)
          The new status of the Qualification type - Active | Inactive

          Possible values:

          o Active

          o Inactive

       --test (string)
          The  questions  for the Qualification test a Worker must answer cor-
          rectly to obtain a Qualification of this type. If this parameter  is
          specified, TestDurationInSeconds must also be specified.

          Constraints:  Must  not  be longer than 65535 bytes. Must be a Ques-
          tionForm data structure. This parameter cannot be specified if Auto-
          Granted is true.

          Constraints:  None.  If  not  specified,  the Worker may request the
          Qualification without answering any questions.

       --answer-key (string)
          The answers to the Qualification test specified in the Test  parame-
          ter, in the form of an AnswerKey data structure.

       --test-duration-in-seconds (long)
          The  number  of seconds the Worker has to complete the Qualification
          test, starting from the time the Worker requests the  Qualification.

       --retry-delay-in-seconds (long)
          The  amount  of  time,  in  seconds,  that  Workers  must wait after
          requesting a  Qualification  of  the  specified  Qualification  type
          before  they can retry the Qualification request. It is not possible
          to disable retries for a Qualification type after it has  been  cre-
          ated  with retries enabled. If you want to disable retries, you must
          dispose of the existing retry-enabled Qualification type using  Dis-
          poseQualificationType  and then create a new Qualification type with
          retries disabled using CreateQualificationType.

       --auto-granted | --no-auto-granted (boolean)
          Specifies whether requests for the Qualification  type  are  granted
          immediately, without prompting the Worker with a Qualification test.

          Constraints: If the Test parameter is specified, this parameter can-
          not be true.

       --auto-granted-value (integer)
          The  Qualification value to use for automatically granted Qualifica-
          tions. This parameter is used only if the AutoGranted  parameter  is
          true.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       QualificationType -> (structure)
          Contains a QualificationType data structure.

          QualificationTypeId -> (string)
              A  unique identifier for the Qualification type. A Qualification
              type is given a Qualification type ID when you call the  Create-
              QualificationType operation.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time the Qualification type was created.

          Name -> (string)
              The  name  of  the  Qualification type. The type name is used to
              identify the type, and to find the type  using  a  Qualification
              type search.

          Description -> (string)
              A long description for the Qualification type.

          Keywords -> (string)
              One  or  more  words  or  phrases that describe theQualification
              type, separated by commas. The Keywords make the type easier  to
              find using a search.

          QualificationTypeStatus -> (string)
              The  status  of  the  Qualification type. A Qualification type's
              status determines if users can apply to receive a  Qualification
              of this type, and if HITs can be created with requirements based
              on this type. Valid values are Active | Inactive.

          Test -> (string)
              The questions for a  Qualification  test  associated  with  this
              Qualification  type  that a user can take to obtain a Qualifica-
              tion of this type. This parameter must be specified if AnswerKey
              is  present.  A  Qualification type cannot have both a specified
              Test parameter and an AutoGranted value of true.

          TestDurationInSeconds -> (long)
              The amount of time, in seconds, given to a  Worker  to  complete
              the  Qualification  test,  beginning  from  the  time the Worker
              requests the Qualification.

          AnswerKey -> (string)
              The answers to the Qualification  test  specified  in  the  Test
              parameter.

          RetryDelayInSeconds -> (long)
              The  amount  of time, in seconds, Workers must wait after taking
              the Qualification test before they can take  it  again.  Workers
              can  take  a  Qualification test multiple times if they were not
              granted the Qualification from a previous  attempt,  or  if  the
              test  offers  a  gradient score and they want a better score. If
              not specified, retries are disabled and Workers  can  request  a
              Qualification only once.

          IsRequestable -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether the Qualification type is one that a user can
              request through the Amazon Mechanical Turk web site, such as  by
              taking  a Qualification test. This value is False for Qualifica-
              tions assigned automatically by the  system.  Valid  values  are
              True | False.

          AutoGranted -> (boolean)
              Specifies  that  requests for the Qualification type are granted
              immediately, without prompting the Worker with  a  Qualification
              test. Valid values are True | False.

          AutoGrantedValue -> (integer)
              The Qualification integer value to use for automatically granted
              Qualifications, if AutoGranted is true. This is 1 by default.
