LIST-BONUS-PAYMENTS()                                    LIST-BONUS-PAYMENTS()



NAME
       list-bonus-payments -

DESCRIPTION
       The  ListBonusPayments  operation  retrieves the amounts of bonuses you
       have paid to Workers for a given HIT or assignment.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-bonus-payments is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: BonusPayments

SYNOPSIS
            list-bonus-payments
          [--hit-id <value>]
          [--assignment-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --hit-id (string)
          The ID of the HIT associated with the bonus payments to retrieve. If
          not specified, all bonus payments for all assignments for the  given
          HIT  are  returned.  Either  the HITId parameter or the AssignmentId
          parameter must be specified

       --assignment-id (string)
          The ID of the assignment  associated  with  the  bonus  payments  to
          retrieve. If specified, only bonus payments for the given assignment
          are returned. Either the HITId parameter or the AssignmentId parame-
          ter must be specified

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NumResults -> (integer)
          The number of bonus payments on this page in  the  filtered  results
          list,  equivalent  to the number of bonus payments being returned by
          this call.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the previous response was incomplete (because there is more  data
          to  retrieve),  Amazon Mechanical Turk returns a pagination token in
          the response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve the next
          set of results.

       BonusPayments -> (list)
          A  successful  request  to the ListBonusPayments operation returns a
          list of BonusPayment objects.

          (structure)
              An object representing a Bonus payment paid to a Worker.

              WorkerId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Worker to whom the bonus was paid.

              BonusAmount -> (string)
                 A string representing a currency amount.

              AssignmentId -> (string)
                 The ID of the assignment associated with this bonus  payment.

              Reason -> (string)
                 The Reason text given when the bonus was granted, if any.

              GrantTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time of when the bonus was granted.
