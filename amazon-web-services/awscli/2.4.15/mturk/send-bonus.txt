SEND-BONUS()                                                      SEND-BONUS()



NAME
       send-bonus -

DESCRIPTION
       The  SendBonus operation issues a payment of money from your account to
       a Worker. This payment happens separately from the reward  you  pay  to
       the  Worker  when  you  approve  the Worker's assignment. The SendBonus
       operation requires the Worker's ID and the assignment ID as  parameters
       to  initiate  payment  of  the  bonus.  You must include a message that
       explains the reason for the bonus payment, as the  Worker  may  not  be
       expecting  the payment. Amazon Mechanical Turk collects a fee for bonus
       payments, similar to the HIT listing fee. This operation fails if  your
       account  does  not  have enough funds to pay for both the bonus and the
       fees.

SYNOPSIS
            send-bonus
          --worker-id <value>
          --bonus-amount <value>
          --assignment-id <value>
          --reason <value>
          [--unique-request-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --worker-id (string)
          The ID of the Worker being paid the bonus.

       --bonus-amount (string)
          The Bonus amount is a US Dollar amount specified using a string (for
          example,  "5"  represents  $5.00 USD and "101.42" represents $101.42
          USD). Do not include currency symbols or currency codes.

       --assignment-id (string)
          The ID of the assignment for which this bonus is paid.

       --reason (string)
          A message that explains the reason for the bonus payment. The Worker
          receiving the bonus can see this message.

       --unique-request-token (string)
          A  unique identifier for this request, which allows you to retry the
          call on error without granting multiple bonuses. This is  useful  in
          cases  such  as  network timeouts where it is unclear whether or not
          the call succeeded on the server. If the bonus already exists in the
          system  from a previous call using the same UniqueRequestToken, sub-
          sequent calls will return an error with  a  message  containing  the
          request ID.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
