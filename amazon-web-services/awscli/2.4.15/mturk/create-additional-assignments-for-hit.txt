NAME
       create-additional-assignments-for-hit -

DESCRIPTION
       The  CreateAdditionalAssignmentsForHIT  operation increases the maximum
       number of assignments of an existing HIT.

       To extend the maximum number of  assignments,  specify  the  number  of
       additional assignments.

       NOTE:

          o HITs  created with fewer than 10 assignments cannot be extended to
            have 10 or more assignments. Attempting to add  assignments  in  a
            way  that  brings  the  total number of assignments for a HIT from
            fewer than 10 assignments to 10 or more assignments will result in
            an AWS.MechanicalTurk.InvalidMaximumAssignmentsIncrease exception.

          o HITs that were created before July 22, 2015  cannot  be  extended.
            Attempting  to  extend HITs that were created before July 22, 2015
            will result in an AWS.MechanicalTurk.HITTooOldForExtension  excep-
            tion.

SYNOPSIS
            create-additional-assignments-for-hit
          --hit-id <value>
          --number-of-additional-assignments <value>
          [--unique-request-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --hit-id (string)
          The ID of the HIT to extend.

       --number-of-additional-assignments (integer)
          The number of additional assignments to request for this HIT.

       --unique-request-token (string)
          A  unique identifier for this request, which allows you to retry the
          call on error without extending the HIT multiple times. This is use-
          ful in cases such as network timeouts where it is unclear whether or
          not the call succeeded on the server.  If  the  extend  HIT  already
          exists  in  the  system  from  a  previous  call using the same Uni-
          queRequestToken , subsequent calls will return an error with a  mes-
          sage containing the request ID.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
