GET-QUALIFICATION-SCORE()                            GET-QUALIFICATION-SCORE()



NAME
       get-qualification-score -

DESCRIPTION
       The  GetQualificationScore  operation  returns  the value of a Worker's
       Qualification for a given Qualification type.

       To get a Worker's Qualification, you must know  the  Worker's  ID.  The
       Worker's  ID is included in the assignment data returned by the ListAs-
       signmentsForHIT operation.

       Only the owner of a  Qualification  type  can  query  the  value  of  a
       Worker's Qualification of that type.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-qualification-score
          --qualification-type-id <value>
          --worker-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --qualification-type-id (string)
          The ID of the QualificationType.

       --worker-id (string)
          The ID of the Worker whose Qualification is being updated.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
