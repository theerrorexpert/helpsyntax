REJECT-ASSIGNMENT()                                        REJECT-ASSIGNMENT()



NAME
       reject-assignment -

DESCRIPTION
       The  RejectAssignment  operation  rejects  the  results  of a completed
       assignment.

       You can include an optional feedback message with the rejection,  which
       the  Worker  can  see  in  the Status section of the web site. When you
       include a feedback message with the  rejection,  it  helps  the  Worker
       understand why the assignment was rejected, and can improve the quality
       of the results the Worker submits in the future.

       Only the Requester who created the HIT can reject an assignment for the
       HIT.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            reject-assignment
          --assignment-id <value>
          --requester-feedback <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --assignment-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the assignment. The assignment must correspond to a HIT
          created by the Requester.

       --requester-feedback (string)
          A message for the Worker, which the Worker can  see  in  the  Status
          section of the web site.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
