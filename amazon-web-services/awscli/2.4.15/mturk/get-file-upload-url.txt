GET-FILE-UPLOAD-URL()                                    GET-FILE-UPLOAD-URL()



NAME
       get-file-upload-url -

DESCRIPTION
       The  GetFileUploadURL  operation generates and returns a temporary URL.
       You use the temporary URL to retrieve a file uploaded by a Worker as an
       answer  to  a FileUploadAnswer question for a HIT. The temporary URL is
       generated the instant the GetFileUploadURL operation is called, and  is
       valid  for 60 seconds. You can get a temporary file upload URL any time
       until the HIT is disposed. After the  HIT  is  disposed,  any  uploaded
       files  are  deleted,  and  cannot  be retrieved. Pending Deprecation on
       December 12, 2017. The Answer Specification structure  will  no  longer
       support  the  FileUploadAnswer  element to be used for the QuestionForm
       data structure. Instead, we recommend that Requesters who want to  cre-
       ate HITs asking Workers to upload files to use Amazon S3.

SYNOPSIS
            get-file-upload-url
          --assignment-id <value>
          --question-identifier <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --assignment-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the assignment that contains the question with a FileU-
          ploadAnswer.

       --question-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the question with a FileUploadAnswer, as specified
          in the QuestionForm of the HIT.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FileUploadURL -> (string)
          A  temporary  URL  for  the  file  that  the Worker uploaded for the
          answer.
