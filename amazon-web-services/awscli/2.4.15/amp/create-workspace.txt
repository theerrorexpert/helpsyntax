DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new AMP workspace.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-workspace
          [--alias <value>]
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --alias (string)
          An  optional  user-assigned  alias for this workspace. This alias is
          for user reference and does not need to be unique.

       --client-token (string)
          Optional, unique, case-sensitive, user-provided identifier to ensure
          the idempotency of the request.

       --tags (map)
          Optional, user-provided tags for this workspace.

          key -> (string)
              The key of the tag.

              Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a maximum of
              128 Unicode characters. Valid characters  are  Unicode  letters,
              digits, white space, and any of the following symbols: _ . : / =
              + - @ May not begin with aws: .

          value -> (string)
              The value of the tag.

              Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and accept a  maximum
              of 256 Unicode characters. Valid characters are Unicode letters,
              digits, white space, and any of the following symbols: _ . : / =
              + - @

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       status -> (structure)

              Status code of this workspace.

          key -> (string)
