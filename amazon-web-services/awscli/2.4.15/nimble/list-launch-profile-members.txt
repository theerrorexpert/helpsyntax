NAME
       list-launch-profile-members -

DESCRIPTION
       Get all users in a given launch profile membership.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-launch-profile-members  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: members

SYNOPSIS
            list-launch-profile-members
          --launch-profile-id <value>
          --studio-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --launch-profile-id (string)
          The Launch Profile ID.

       --studio-id (string)
          The studio ID.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       members -> (list)
          A list of members.

          (structure)
              Launch profile membership enables your studio admins to delegate
              launch profile access to other studio users in the Nimble Studio
              portal  without  needing  to write or maintain complex IAM poli-
              cies. A launch profile member is a user  association  from  your
              studio  identity  source  who is granted permissions to a launch
              profile.

              A launch profile member (type USER) provides the following  per-
              missions to that launch profile:

              o GetLaunchProfile

              o GetLaunchProfileInitialization

              o GetLaunchProfileMembers

              o GetLaunchProfileMember

              o CreateStreamingSession

              o GetLaunchProfileDetails

              identityStoreId -> (string)
                 The ID of the identity store.

              persona -> (string)
                 The persona.

              principalId -> (string)
                 The principal ID.

              sid -> (string)
                 The  Active  Directory  Security Identifier for this user, if
                 available.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results, or null if there are no  more
          results.
