LIST-LAUNCH-PROFILES()                                  LIST-LAUNCH-PROFILES()



NAME
       list-launch-profiles -

DESCRIPTION
       List all the launch profiles a studio.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-launch-profiles  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: launchProfiles

SYNOPSIS
            list-launch-profiles
          [--principal-id <value>]
          [--states <value>]
          --studio-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --principal-id (string)
          The principal ID. This currently supports a Amazon Web Services  SSO
          UserId.

       --states (list)
          Filter this request to launch profiles in any of the given states.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            CREATE_IN_PROGRESS
            READY
            UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS
            DELETE_IN_PROGRESS
            DELETED
            DELETE_FAILED
            CREATE_FAILED
            UPDATE_FAILED

       --studio-id (string)
          The studio ID.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       launchProfiles -> (list)
          A collection of launch profiles.

          (structure)
              A launch profile controls your artist workforces access to  stu-
              dio components, like compute farms, shared file systems, managed
              file systems, and license  server  configurations,  as  well  as
              instance types and Amazon Machine Images (AMIs).
                 <p>Studio administrators create launch profiles in the Nimble
                 Studio console. Artists can  use  their  launch  profiles  to
                 launch  an instance from the Nimble Studio portal. Each users
                 launch profile defines how they can launch a  streaming  ses-
                 sion.  By  default,  studio  admins  can  use all launch pro-
                 files.</p>

              launchProfileProtocolVersions -> (list)
                 The version number of the protocol that is used by the launch

                 (string)
                     The version number of the protocol that is  used  by  the
                     launch profile. The only valid version is "2021-03-31".

              statusCode -> (string)
                 The status code.

              statusMessage -> (string)
                 The status message for the launch profile.

              streamConfiguration -> (structure)
                 A configuration for a streaming session.

                 clipboardMode -> (string)
                     Enable or disable the use of the system clipboard to copy
                     and paste between the  streaming  session  and  streaming
                     client.

                 ec2InstanceTypes -> (list)
                     The  EC2  instance  types that users can select from when
                     launching a streaming session with this launch profile.

                     (string)

                 maxSessionLengthInMinutes -> (integer)
                     The length of time, in minutes, that a streaming  session
                     can  be  active before it is stopped or terminated. After
                     this point, Nimble  Studio  automatically  terminates  or
                     stops the session. The default length of time is 690 min-
                     utes, and the maximum length of time is 30 days.

                 maxStoppedSessionLengthInMinutes -> (integer)
                     Integer that determines if you can start  and  stop  your
                     sessions  and  how long a session can stay in the STOPPED
                     state. The default value is 0. The maximum value is 5760.

                     If  the  value is missing or set to 0, your sessions cant
                     be stopped. If you then call StopStreamingSession  ,  the
                     session  fails.  If  the time that a session stays in the
                     READY state exceeds the maxSessionLengthInMinutes  value,
                     the  session  will  automatically  be  terminated  by AWS
                     (instead of stopped).

                     If the value is set to a positive number, the session can
                     be  stopped.  You  can  call StopStreamingSession to stop
                     sessions in the READY state. If the time that  a  session
                     stays  in the READY state exceeds the maxSessionLengthIn-
                     Minutes value, the session will automatically be  stopped
                     by AWS (instead of terminated).

                 sessionStorage -> (structure)
                     (Optional) The upload storage for a streaming session.

                     mode -> (list)
                        Allows  artists to upload files to their workstations.

                     root -> (structure)
                        The configuration for the upload storage root  of  the
