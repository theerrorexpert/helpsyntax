NAME
       start-studio-sso-configuration-repair -

DESCRIPTION
       Repairs the Amazon Web Services SSO configuration for a given studio.

       If  the  studio  has a valid Amazon Web Services SSO configuration cur-
       rently associated with it, this operation will fail with  a  validation
       error.

       If  the studio does not have a valid Amazon Web Services SSO configura-
       tion currently associated with it, then a new Amazon Web  Services  SSO
       application  is created for the studio and the studio is changed to the
       READY state.

       After the Amazon Web Services SSO application is repaired, you must use
       the  Amazon  Nimble  Studio  console to add administrators and users to
       your studio.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-studio-sso-configuration-repair
          [--client-token <value>]
          --studio-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you  provide  to  ensure  the
          idempotency  of the request. If you dont specify a client token, the
          AWS SDK automatically generates a client token and uses it  for  the
          request to ensure idempotency.

       --studio-id (string)
          The studio ID.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
