NAME
       list-studios -

DESCRIPTION
       List  studios in your Amazon Web Services account in the requested Ama-
       zon Web Services Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-studios is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the  results  of  the  following  query
       expressions: studios

SYNOPSIS
            list-studios
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          The  token for the next set of results, or null if there are no more
          results.

       studios -> (list)
          A collection of studios.

          (structure)
              Represents a studio resource.

              A studio is the core resource used with Nimble Studio. You  must
              create  a  studio  first,  before any other resource type can be
              created. All other resources you create  and  manage  in  Nimble
              Studio are contained within a studio.

              When  creating a studio, you must provides two IAM roles for use
              with the Nimble Studio portal. These roles are assumed  by  your
              users  when  they  log in to the Nimble Studio portal via Amazon
              Web Services SSO and your identity source.

              The user role must have the  AmazonNimbleStudio-StudioUser  man-
              aged policy attached for the portal to function properly.

              The admin role must have the AmazonNimbleStudio-StudioAdmin man-
              aged policy attached for the portal to function properly.

              Your studio roles must trust  the  identity.nimble.amazonaws.com
              service principal to function properly.

              adminRoleArn -> (string)

                 located.

              ssoClientId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services SSO application  client  ID  used  to
                 integrate  with  Amazon Web Services SSO to enable Amazon Web
                 Services SSO users to log in to Nimble Studio portal.

              state -> (string)
                 The current state of the studio resource.
