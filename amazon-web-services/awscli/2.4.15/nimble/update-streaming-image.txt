SYNOPSIS
            update-streaming-image
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--description <value>]
          [--name <value>]
          --streaming-image-id <value>
          --studio-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive  identifier  that  you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. If you dont specify a client token,  the
          AWS  SDK  automatically generates a client token and uses it for the
          request to ensure idempotency.

       --description (string)
          The description.

       --name (string)
          The name for the streaming image.

       --streaming-image-id (string)
          The streaming image ID.

       --studio-id (string)
          The studio ID.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT

          Streaming images are used by studio users to select which  operating
          system  and  software  they want to use in a Nimble Studio streaming
          session.

          Amazon provides a number of streaming images  that  include  popular
          3rd-party software.

          You  can  create  your  own streaming images using an Amazon Elastic

              The ARN of the resource.

          description -> (string)
              A human-readable description of the streaming image.

          ec2ImageId -> (string)
              The  ID of an EC2 machine image with which to create the stream-
              ing image.

          encryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
              The encryption configuration.

              keyArn -> (string)

          eulaIds -> (list)
              The list of EULAs that must be accepted before a Streaming  Ses-
              sion can be started using this streaming image.

              (string)

          name -> (string)
              A friendly name for a streaming image resource.

          owner -> (string)
              The  owner of the streaming image, either the studioId that con-
              tains the streaming image, or 'amazon' for images that are  pro-

          platform -> (string)
              The platform of the streaming image, either WINDOWS or LINUX.

          streamingImageId -> (string)
              The ID of the streaming image.

          tags -> (map)
              A  collection  of  labels,  in the form of key:value pairs, that
              apply to this resource.
