SYNOPSIS
            create-streaming-session
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--ec2-instance-type <value>]
          [--launch-profile-id <value>]
          [--owned-by <value>]
          [--streaming-image-id <value>]
          --studio-id <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you  provide  to  ensure  the
          idempotency  of the request. If you dont specify a client token, the
          AWS SDK automatically generates a client token and uses it  for  the
          request to ensure idempotency.

       --ec2-instance-type (string)
          The EC2 Instance type used for the streaming session.

          Possible values:

          o g4dn.xlarge

          o g4dn.2xlarge

          o g4dn.4xlarge

          o g4dn.8xlarge

          o g4dn.12xlarge

          o g4dn.16xlarge

       --launch-profile-id (string)
          The launch profile ID.

       --owned-by (string)
          The  user  ID  of the user that owns the streaming session. The user
          that owns the session will be logging into the session and interact-
          ing with the virtual workstation.

       --streaming-image-id (string)
          The ID of the streaming image.

       --studio-id (string)
          The studio ID.

       --tags (map)
          A  collection  of labels, in the form of key:value pairs, that apply
          to this resource.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
