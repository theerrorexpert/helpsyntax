SYNOPSIS
            list-jobs
          --account-id <value>
          [--job-statuses <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID  associated  with  the  S3  Batch
          Operations job.

       --job-statuses (list)
          The List Jobs request returns jobs that match the statuses listed in
          this element.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            Active
            Cancelled
            Cancelling
            Complete
            Completing
            Failed
            Failing
            New
            Paused
            Pausing
            Preparing
            Ready
            Suspended

       --next-token (string)
          A pagination token to request the next  page  of  results.  Use  the
          token  that  Amazon  S3  returned  in  the  NextToken element of the
          ListJobsResult from the previous List Jobs request.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of jobs that Amazon S3 will include in  the  List
          Jobs response. If there are more jobs than this number, the response
          will include a pagination token in the NextToken field to enable you
          to retrieve the next page of results.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
