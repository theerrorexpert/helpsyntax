       tions job. For more information, see S3 Batch Operations in the  Amazon
       S3 User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-job
          --account-id <value>
          --job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The  Amazon  Web  Services  account  ID associated with the S3 Batch
          Operations job.

       --job-id (string)
          The ID for the job whose information you want to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                        Value -> (string)

                 RedirectLocation -> (string)

                     rects,  x-amz-website-redirect-location  . Allows webpage
                     redirects if the object is  accessed  through  a  website

                 UnModifiedSinceConstraint -> (timestamp)

                 SSEAwsKmsKeyId -> (string)

                     Specifies the folder prefix into which you would like the
                     objects to be copied. For example, to copy objects into a

                 ObjectLockLegalHoldStatus -> (string)
                     The legal hold status to be applied to all objects in the
                     Batch Operations job.

                 ObjectLockMode -> (string)

                     Batch Operations job.

                 ObjectLockRetainUntilDate -> (timestamp)
                     The date when the applied object retention  configuration
                     expires on all objects in the Batch Operations job.

                 BucketKeyEnabled -> (boolean)

                     for object encryption with server-side  encryption  using
                     Amazon Web Services KMS (SSE-KMS). Setting this header to
                     true causes Amazon S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key for  object
                     encryption with SSE-KMS.

                     Specifying  this  header  with  an  object  action doesnt
                     affect bucket-level settings for S3 Bucket Key.

              S3PutObjectAcl -> (structure)
                 Directs the specified job to run a PUT  Object  acl  call  on

                     AccessControlList -> (structure)
                        Owner -> (structure)

                            DisplayName -> (string)

                        Grants -> (list)
                            (structure)
                               Grantee -> (structure)
                                   TypeIdentifier -> (string)

                                   Identifier -> (string)

                                   DisplayName -> (string)

                               Permission -> (string)

                     CannedAccessControlList -> (string)

              S3PutObjectTagging -> (structure)
                 Directs the specified job to run a PUT Object tagging call on
                 every object in the manifest.

                 TagSet -> (list)
                     (structure)
                        Key -> (string)

                        Value -> (string)

              S3DeleteObjectTagging -> (structure)
                 Directs the specified job to execute a DELETE Object  tagging
                 call on every object in the manifest.

              S3InitiateRestoreObject -> (structure)
                 Directs  the  specified  job to initiate restore requests for
                 every archived object in the manifest.

                 ExpirationInDays -> (integer)
                     This argument specifies how long the S3 Glacier  Flexible
                     Retrieval  or  S3  Glacier  Deep  Archive  object remains
                     available in Amazon S3. S3 Initiate Restore  Object  jobs
                     that  target S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval and S3 Glacier
                     Deep Archive objects require ExpirationInDays set to 1 or
                     greater.

                     Conversely,  do not set ExpirationInDays when creating S3
                     Initiate Restore Object  jobs  that  target  S3  Intelli-
                     gent-Tiering  Archive Access and Deep Archive Access tier
                     objects. Objects in S3 Intelligent-Tiering archive access
                     tiers  are  not  subject to restore expiry, so specifying
                     ExpirationInDays results in restore request failure.

                     S3 Batch Operations jobs can operate either on S3 Glacier
                     Flexible  Retrieval  and  S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage
                     class objects or on S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive Access
                     and  Deep  Archive  Access  storage tier objects, but not
                     both types in the  same  job.  If  you  need  to  restore
                     objects  of  both  types  you  must create separate Batch
                     Operations jobs.

                 GlacierJobTier -> (string)
                     S3 Batch Operations supports STANDARD and BULK  retrieval
                     tiers, but not the EXPEDITED retrieval tier.

              S3PutObjectLegalHold -> (structure)
                 Contains  the  configuration for an S3 Object Lock legal hold
                 operation that an S3 Batch Operations job passes every object
                 to  the  underlying PutObjectLegalHold API. For more informa-
                 tion, see Using S3 Object Lock legal hold with S3 Batch Oper-
                 ations in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

                 LegalHold -> (structure)
                     Contains  the Object Lock legal hold status to be applied
                     to all objects in the Batch Operations job.

                     Status -> (string)
                        The Object Lock legal hold status to be applied to all
                        objects in the Batch Operations job.

              S3PutObjectRetention -> (structure)
                 Contains  the  configuration  parameters  for the Object Lock
                 retention action for an S3 Batch Operations job. Batch Opera-
                 tions  passes  every object to the underlying PutObjectReten-
                 tion API. For more information,  see  Using  S3  Object  Lock
                 retention  with  S3  Batch  Operations  in the Amazon S3 User
