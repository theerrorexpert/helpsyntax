NAME
       delete-bucket-lifecycle-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This action deletes an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket's lifecycle con-
          figuration. To delete an S3 bucket's  lifecycle  configuration,  see
          DeleteBucketLifecycle in the Amazon S3 API Reference .

       Deletes the lifecycle configuration from the specified Outposts bucket.
       Amazon S3 on Outposts removes all the lifecycle configuration rules  in
       the  lifecycle  subresource  associated  with  the bucket. Your objects
       never expire, and Amazon S3 on Outposts no longer automatically deletes
       any  objects  on  the basis of rules contained in the deleted lifecycle
       configuration. For more information, see Using Amazon S3 on Outposts in
       Amazon S3 User Guide .

       To  use  this  action,  you must have permission to perform the s3-out-
       posts:DeleteLifecycleConfiguration action. By default, the bucket owner
       has  this  permission and the Outposts bucket owner can grant this per-
       mission to others.

       All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require  an
       additional  parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the request
       and an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of s3-control  .
       For  an  example  of  the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that
       uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname  prefix  and  the  x-amz-out-
       post-id derived using the access point ARN, see the Examples section.

       For  more information about object expiration, see Elements to Describe
       Lifecycle Actions .

SYNOPSIS
            delete-bucket-lifecycle-configuration
          --account-id <value>
          --bucket <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The account ID of the lifecycle configuration to delete.

       --bucket (string)
          Specifies the bucket.

          For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts  with  the  REST
          API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

          For  using  this  parameter  with S3 on Outposts with the Amazon Web
          Services SDK and CLI,  you  must  specify  the  ARN  of  the  bucket
          accessed         in         the        format        arn:aws:s3-out-
          posts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<out-
          post-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name> . For example, to access the bucket
          reports through outpost my-outpost owned by account 123456789012  in
          Region   us-west-2   ,  use  the  URL  encoding  of  arn:aws:s3-out-
          posts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports . The
          value must be URL encoded.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
