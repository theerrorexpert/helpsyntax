LIST-REGIONAL-BUCKETS()                                LIST-REGIONAL-BUCKETS()



NAME
       list-regional-buckets -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list of all Outposts buckets in an Outpost that are owned by
       the authenticated sender of the  request.  For  more  information,  see
       Using Amazon S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       For  an  example  of  the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that
       uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix  and  x-amz-outpost-id
       in your request, see the Examples section.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-regional-buckets
          --account-id <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--outpost-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID of the Outposts bucket.

       --next-token (string)

       --max-results (integer)

       --outpost-id (string)
          The ID of the Outposts.

          NOTE:
              This is required by Amazon S3 on Outposts buckets.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RegionalBucketList -> (list)
          (structure)
              The container for the regional bucket.

              Bucket -> (string)

              BucketArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the regional bucket.

              PublicAccessBlockEnabled -> (boolean)

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The creation date of the regional bucket

              OutpostId -> (string)
                 The Outposts ID of the regional bucket.

       NextToken -> (string)
          NextToken  is  sent  when isTruncated is true, which means there are
          more buckets that can be listed. The next list requests to Amazon S3
          can  be  continued with this NextToken . NextToken is obfuscated and
          is not a real key.
