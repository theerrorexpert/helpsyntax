SYNOPSIS
            describe-multi-region-access-point-operation
          --account-id <value>
          --request-token-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID for the owner of the Multi-Region
          Access Point.

       --request-token-arn (string)
          The  request  token  associated  with  the  request you want to know
          about. This request token is returned as part of the  response  when
          you  make  an  asynchronous request. You provide this token to query
          about the status of the asynchronous action.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AsyncOperation -> (structure)
          A container element containing the details of the asynchronous oper-
          ation.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the request was sent to the service.

          Operation -> (string)
              The specific operation for the asynchronous request.

          RequestTokenARN -> (string)
              The request token associated with the request.

          RequestParameters -> (structure)
              The parameters associated with the request.

              CreateMultiRegionAccessPointRequest -> (structure)
                 A      container      of     the     parameters     for     a
                 CreateMultiRegionAccessPoint request.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name of the Multi-Region Access Point associated with
                     this request.

                 PublicAccessBlock -> (structure)
                     The  PublicAccessBlock  configuration  that  you  want to
                     apply to this Amazon S3 account. You can enable the  con-
                     figuration  options in any combination. For more informa-
                     tion about when Amazon S3 considers a  bucket  or  object
                     public, see The Meaning of "Public" in the Amazon S3 User
                     Guide .

                     This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

                     BlockPublicAcls -> (boolean)
                        Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public access
                        control lists (ACLs) for buckets in this account. Set-
                        ting this element to TRUE causes the following  behav-
                        ior:

                        o PUT  Bucket acl and PUT Object acl calls fail if the
                          specified ACL is public.

                        o PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a pub-
                          lic ACL.

                        o PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a pub-
                          lic ACL.

                        Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing policies
                        or ACLs.

                        This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

                     IgnorePublicAcls -> (boolean)
                        Specifies  whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs
                        for buckets in this account. Setting this  element  to
                        TRUE  causes  Amazon  S3  to ignore all public ACLs on
                        buckets in this account and any objects that they con-
                        tain.

                        Enabling  this  setting doesn't affect the persistence
                        of any existing ACLs and doesn't  prevent  new  public
                        ACLs from being set.

                        This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

                     BlockPublicPolicy -> (boolean)
                        Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket
                        policies for buckets in  this  account.  Setting  this
                        element  to  TRUE  causes Amazon S3 to reject calls to
                        PUT Bucket  policy  if  the  specified  bucket  policy
                        allows public access.

                        Enabling  this  setting doesn't affect existing bucket
                        policies.

                        This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

                     RestrictPublicBuckets -> (boolean)
                        Specifies whether Amazon  S3  should  restrict  public
                        bucket  policies  for buckets in this account. Setting
                        this element to TRUE restricts access to buckets  with
                        public  policies to only Amazon Web Service principals
                        and authorized users within this account.

                        Enabling this setting doesn't affect previously stored
                        bucket  policies, except that public and cross-account
                        access within  any  public  bucket  policy,  including
                        non-public   delegation   to   specific  accounts,  is
                        blocked.

                        This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.
