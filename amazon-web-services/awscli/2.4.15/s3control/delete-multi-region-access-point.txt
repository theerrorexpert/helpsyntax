       This  action  will always be routed to the US West (Oregon) Region. For
       more information about the restrictions  around  managing  Multi-Region
       Access Points, see Managing Multi-Region Access Points in the Amazon S3
       User Guide .

       the request with DescribeMultiRegionAccessPointOperation .

SYNOPSIS
            delete-multi-region-access-point
          --account-id <value>
          [--client-token <value>]
          --details <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID for the owner of the Multi-Region
          Access Point.

       --client-token (string)
          An idempotency token used to identify the request and guarantee that
          requests are unique.

       --details (structure)
          A container element containing details about the Multi-Region Access
          Point.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the Multi-Region Access Point associated  with  this
              request.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Name": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RequestTokenARN -> (string)
          The  request  token  associated  with  the request. You can use this
          token with DescribeMultiRegionAccessPointOperation to determine  the
          status of asynchronous requests.
