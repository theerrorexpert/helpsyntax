PUT-ACCESS-POINT-POLICY()                            PUT-ACCESS-POINT-POLICY()



NAME
       put-access-point-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  an  access  policy  with  the  specified access point. Each
       access point can have only one policy, so a request made  to  this  API
       replaces  any  existing  policy  associated  with  the specified access
       point.

       All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require  an
       additional  parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the request
       and an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of s3-control  .
       For  an  example  of  the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that
       uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname  prefix  and  the  x-amz-out-
       post-id derived using the access point ARN, see the Examples section.

       The following actions are related to PutAccessPointPolicy :

       o GetAccessPointPolicy

       o DeleteAccessPointPolicy

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-access-point-policy
          --account-id <value>
          --name <value>
          --policy <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The  Amazon  Web Services account ID for owner of the bucket associ-
          ated with the specified access point.

       --name (string)
          The name of the access point that you want  to  associate  with  the
          specified policy.

          For  using  this  parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST
          API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

          For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts  with  the  Amazon  Web
          Services  SDK  and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the access point
          accessed        in        the         format         arn:aws:s3-out-
          posts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/access-
          point/<my-accesspoint-name> . For  example,  to  access  the  access
          point   reports-ap  through  outpost  my-outpost  owned  by  account
          123456789012  in  Region  us-west-2  ,  use  the  URL  encoding   of
          arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-out-
          post/accesspoint/reports-ap . The value must be URL encoded.

       --policy (string)
          The policy that you want to apply to the specified access point. For
          more  information  about  access  point  policies, see Managing data
          access with Amazon S3 access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To set an access point policy

       The following  put-access-point-policy  example  places  the  specified
       access  point  policy  for  the  access  point  finance-ap  in  account
       123456789012. If the access point finance-ap already has a policy, this
       command  replaces  the  existing  policy with the one specified in this
       command. Before running  this  example,  replace  the  account  number,
       access  point  name,  and policy statements with appropriate values for
       your use case.

          aws s3control put-access-point-policy \
              --account-id 123456789012 \
              --name finance-ap \
              --policy file://ap-policy.json

       Contents of ap-policy.json:

          {
              "Version": "2012-10-17",
              "Statement": [
                  {
                      "Effect": "Allow",
                      "Principal": {
                          "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Alice"
                      },
                      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/finance-ap/object/Alice/*"
                  }
              ]
          }

       This command produces no output.
