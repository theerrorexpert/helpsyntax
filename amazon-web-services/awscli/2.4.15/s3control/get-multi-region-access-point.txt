SYNOPSIS
            get-multi-region-access-point
          --account-id <value>
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID for the owner of the Multi-Region
          Access Point.

       --name (string)
          The name of the Multi-Region Access Point whose configuration infor-
          mation  you  want  to  receive.  The name of the Multi-Region Access
          Point is different from the alias. For more  information  about  the
          distinction between the name and the alias of an Multi-Region Access
          Point, see Managing Multi-Region Access Points in the Amazon S3 User
          Guide .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AccessPoint -> (structure)
          A   container  element  containing  the  details  of  the  requested
          Multi-Region Access Point.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the Multi-Region Access Point.

          Alias -> (string)
              The alias for the Multi-Region Access Point. For  more  informa-
              tion  about the distinction between the name and the alias of an
              Multi-Region Access  Point,  see  Managing  Multi-Region  Access
              Points .

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              When  the Multi-Region Access Point create request was received.

          PublicAccessBlock -> (structure)
              The PublicAccessBlock configuration that you want  to  apply  to
              this Amazon S3 account. You can enable the configuration options
              in any combination. For more information about  when  Amazon  S3
              considers a bucket or object public, see The Meaning of "Public"
              in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

              This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

              BlockPublicAcls -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public  access  con-
                 trol  lists  (ACLs) for buckets in this account. Setting this
                 element to TRUE causes the following behavior:

                 o PUT Bucket acl and PUT Object acl calls fail if the  speci-
                   fied ACL is public.

                 o PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

                 o PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

                 Enabling  this  setting  doesn't  affect existing policies or
                 ACLs.

                 This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

              IgnorePublicAcls -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether Amazon S3 should  ignore  public  ACLs  for
                 buckets  in this account. Setting this element to TRUE causes
                 Amazon S3 to ignore  all  public  ACLs  on  buckets  in  this
                 account and any objects that they contain.

                 Enabling  this  setting doesn't affect the persistence of any
                 existing ACLs and doesn't prevent new public ACLs from  being
                 set.

                 This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

              BlockPublicPolicy -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket poli-
                 cies for buckets in this account.  Setting  this  element  to
                 TRUE causes Amazon S3 to reject calls to PUT Bucket policy if
                 the specified bucket policy allows public access.

                 Enabling this setting doesn't affect  existing  bucket  poli-
                 cies.

                 This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

              RestrictPublicBuckets -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether  Amazon  S3  should restrict public bucket
                 policies for buckets in this account. Setting this element to
                 TRUE restricts access to buckets with public policies to only
                 Amazon Web Service principals  and  authorized  users  within
                 this account.

                 Enabling this setting doesn't affect previously stored bucket
                 policies, except that public and cross-account access  within
                 any  public bucket policy, including non-public delegation to
                 specific accounts, is blocked.

                 This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          Status -> (string)
              The current status of the Multi-Region Access Point.
                 CREATING and DELETING are temporary states that  exist  while
                 the   request  is  propogating  and  being  completed.  If  a
                 Multi-Region Access Point has a status of PARTIALLY_CREATED ,
                 you  can  retry  creation  or  send  a  request to delete the
                 Multi-Region Access Point. If a Multi-Region Access Point has
                 a  status  of  PARTIALLY_DELETED  ,  you  can  retry a delete
                 request to finish the deletion  of  the  Multi-Region  Access
                 Point.

          Regions -> (list)
              A  collection  of  the  Regions  and buckets associated with the
              Multi-Region Access Point.

              (structure)
                 A combination of  a  bucket  and  Region  that's  part  of  a
                 Multi-Region Access Point.

                 Bucket -> (string)
                     The name of the bucket.

                 Region -> (string)
                     The name of the Region.
