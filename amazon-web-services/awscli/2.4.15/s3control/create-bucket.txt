DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This action creates an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket. To create an S3
          bucket, see Create Bucket in the Amazon S3 API Reference .

       Creates a new Outposts bucket. By creating the bucket, you  become  the
       bucket  owner.  To  create an Outposts bucket, you must have S3 on Out-

       S3 User Guide .

       Not  every  string  is  an  acceptable  bucket name. For information on
       bucket naming restrictions, see Working with Amazon S3 Buckets .

       S3 on Outposts buckets support:

       o Tags

       o LifecycleConfigurations for deleting expired objects

       For a complete list of restrictions and Amazon S3  feature  limitations

       tions .

       For an example of the request syntax for Amazon  S3  on  Outposts  that
       uses  the  S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and x-amz-outpost-id
       in your API request, see the Examples section.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Location -> (string)
          The location of the bucket.

       BucketArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the bucket.

          For  using  this  parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST
          API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

          For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts  with  the  Amazon  Web
          Services  SDK  and  CLI,  you  must  specify  the  ARN of the bucket
          accessed        in        the         format         arn:aws:s3-out-
          posts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<out-
          post-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name> . For example, to access the bucket
          reports  through outpost my-outpost owned by account 123456789012 in
          Region  us-west-2  ,  use  the  URL  encoding   of   arn:aws:s3-out-
          posts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports . The
          value must be URL encoded.
