GET-ACCESS-POINT()                                          GET-ACCESS-POINT()



NAME
       get-access-point -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns configuration information about the specified access point.

       All  Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an
       additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the  request
       and  an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of s3-control .
       For an example of the request syntax for Amazon  S3  on  Outposts  that
       uses  the  S3  on  Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the x-amz-out-
       post-id derived using the access point ARN, see the Examples section.

       The following actions are related to GetAccessPoint :

       o CreateAccessPoint

       o DeleteAccessPoint

       o ListAccessPoints

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-access-point
          --account-id <value>
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The account ID for the account that owns the specified access point.

       --name (string)
          The  name  of  the  access point whose configuration information you
          want to retrieve.

          For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts  with  the  REST
          API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

          For  using  this  parameter  with S3 on Outposts with the Amazon Web
          Services SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the  access  point
          accessed         in         the        format        arn:aws:s3-out-
          posts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/access-
          point/<my-accesspoint-name>  .  For  example,  to  access the access
          point  reports-ap  through  outpost  my-outpost  owned  by   account
          123456789012   in  Region  us-west-2  ,  use  the  URL  encoding  of
          arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-out-
          post/accesspoint/reports-ap . The value must be URL encoded.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve access point configuration details

       The  following  get-access-point  example  retrieves  the configuration
       details for the access point named finance-ap in account  123456789012.
       Before  running this example, replace the access point name and account
       number with appropriate values for your use case.

          aws s3control get-access-point \
              --account-id 123456789012 \
              --name finance-ap

       Output:

          {
              "Name": "finance-ap",
              "Bucket": "business-records",
              "NetworkOrigin": "Internet",
              "PublicAccessBlockConfiguration": {
                  "BlockPublicAcls": false,
                  "IgnorePublicAcls": false,
                  "BlockPublicPolicy": false,
                  "RestrictPublicBuckets": false
              },
              "CreationDate": "2020-01-01T00:00:00Z"
          }

       Points in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       Name -> (string)
          The name of the specified access point.

       Bucket -> (string)
          The name of the bucket associated with the specified access point.

       NetworkOrigin -> (string)
          Indicates  whether  this  access point allows access from the public
          internet. If VpcConfiguration is specified for  this  access  point,
          then  NetworkOrigin  is  VPC  ,  and  the access point doesn't allow
          access from the public internet. Otherwise, NetworkOrigin is  Inter-
          net  ,  and the access point allows access from the public internet,
          subject to the access point and bucket access policies.

          This will always be true for an Amazon S3 on Outposts access point

       VpcConfiguration -> (structure)
          Contains the virtual private cloud (VPC) configuration for the spec-
          ified access point.

          NOTE:
              This  element  is  empty if this access point is an Amazon S3 on
              Outposts access point that is used by other Amazon Web Services.

          VpcId -> (string)
              If  this  field  is specified, this access point will only allow
              connections from the specified VPC ID.

       PublicAccessBlockConfiguration -> (structure)
          The PublicAccessBlock configuration that you want to apply  to  this
          Amazon  S3  account. You can enable the configuration options in any
          combination. For more information about when Amazon S3  considers  a
          bucket  or  object public, see The Meaning of "Public" in the Amazon
          S3 User Guide .

          This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          BlockPublicAcls -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public  access  control
              lists  (ACLs)  for buckets in this account. Setting this element
              to TRUE causes the following behavior:

              o PUT Bucket acl and PUT Object acl calls fail if the  specified
                ACL is public.

              o PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

              o PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

              Enabling  this setting doesn't affect existing policies or ACLs.

              This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          IgnorePublicAcls -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs for  buck-
              ets  in this account. Setting this element to TRUE causes Amazon
              S3 to ignore all public ACLs on buckets in this account and  any
              objects that they contain.

              Enabling  this  setting  doesn't  affect  the persistence of any
              existing ACLs and doesn't prevent new  public  ACLs  from  being
              set.

              This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          BlockPublicPolicy -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket policies
              for buckets in this account. Setting this element to TRUE causes
              Amazon  S3 to reject calls to PUT Bucket policy if the specified
              bucket policy allows public access.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing bucket policies.

              This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          RestrictPublicBuckets -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether Amazon S3 should restrict public bucket  poli-
              cies  for  buckets in this account. Setting this element to TRUE
              restricts access to buckets with public policies to only  Amazon
              Web Service principals and authorized users within this account.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect  previously  stored  bucket
              policies, except that public and cross-account access within any
              public bucket policy, including non-public  delegation  to  spe-
              cific accounts, is blocked.

              This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       CreationDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time when the specified access point was created.

       Alias -> (string)
          The name or alias of the access point.

       AccessPointArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the access point.

       Endpoints -> (map)
          The VPC endpoint for the access point.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)
