CREATE-ACCESS-POINT()                                    CREATE-ACCESS-POINT()



NAME
       create-access-point -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  access  point and associates it with the specified bucket.
       For more information, see Managing Data Access with  Amazon  S3  Access
       Points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       NOTE:
          S3 on Outposts only supports VPC-style access points.

          For more information, see Accessing Amazon S3 on Outposts using vir-
          tual private cloud (VPC) only access points in the  Amazon  S3  User
          Guide .

       All  Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an
       additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the  request
       and  an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of s3-control .
       For an example of the request syntax for Amazon  S3  on  Outposts  that
       uses  the  S3  on  Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the x-amz-out-
       post-id derived using the access point ARN, see the Examples section.

       The following actions are related to CreateAccessPoint :

SYNOPSIS
            create-access-point
          --account-id <value>
          --name <value>
          --bucket <value>
          [--vpc-configuration <value>]
          [--public-access-block-configuration <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID for the owner of the  bucket  for
          which you want to create an access point.

       --name (string)
          The name you want to assign to this access point.

       --bucket (string)
          The  name of the bucket that you want to associate this access point
          with.

          For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts  with  the  REST
          API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

          For  using  this  parameter  with S3 on Outposts with the Amazon Web
          Services SDK and CLI,  you  must  specify  the  ARN  of  the  bucket
          accessed         in         the        format        arn:aws:s3-out-
          posts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<out-
          post-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name> . For example, to access the bucket
          reports through outpost my-outpost owned by account 123456789012  in
          Region   us-west-2   ,  use  the  URL  encoding  of  arn:aws:s3-out-
          posts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports . The
          value must be URL encoded.

       --vpc-configuration (structure)
          If you include this field, Amazon S3 restricts access to this access
          point to requests from the specified virtual private cloud (VPC).

          NOTE:
              This is required for creating an access point for Amazon  S3  on
              Outposts buckets.

          VpcId -> (string)
              If  this  field  is specified, this access point will only allow
              connections from the specified VPC ID.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          VpcId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "VpcId": "string"
          }

       --public-access-block-configuration (structure)
          The PublicAccessBlock configuration that you want to  apply  to  the
          access point.

          BlockPublicAcls -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  Amazon S3 should block public access control
              lists (ACLs) for buckets in this account. Setting  this  element
              to TRUE causes the following behavior:

              o PUT  Bucket acl and PUT Object acl calls fail if the specified
                ACL is public.

              o PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

              o PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing policies or  ACLs.

              This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          IgnorePublicAcls -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs for buck-
              ets in this account. Setting this element to TRUE causes  Amazon
              S3  to ignore all public ACLs on buckets in this account and any
              objects that they contain.

              Enabling this setting doesn't  affect  the  persistence  of  any
              existing  ACLs  and  doesn't  prevent new public ACLs from being
              set.

              This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          BlockPublicPolicy -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket  policies
              for buckets in this account. Setting this element to TRUE causes
              Amazon S3 to reject calls to PUT Bucket policy if the  specified
              bucket policy allows public access.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing bucket policies.

              This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          RestrictPublicBuckets -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether Amazon S3 should restrict public bucket poli-
              cies for buckets in this account. Setting this element  to  TRUE
              restricts  access to buckets with public policies to only Amazon
              Web Service principals and authorized users within this account.

              Enabling  this  setting  doesn't affect previously stored bucket
              policies, except that public and cross-account access within any
              public  bucket  policy,  including non-public delegation to spe-
              cific accounts, is blocked.

              This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          BlockPublicAcls=boolean,IgnorePublicAcls=boolean,BlockPublicPolicy=boolean,RestrictPublicBuckets=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "BlockPublicAcls": true|false,
            "IgnorePublicAcls": true|false,
            "BlockPublicPolicy": true|false,
            "RestrictPublicBuckets": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create an access point

       The following create-access-point example creates an access point named
       finance-ap  for  the  bucket  business-records in account 123456789012.
       Before running this example, replace  the  access  point  name,  bucket
       name, and account number with appropriate values for your use case.

          aws s3control create-access-point \
              --account-id 123456789012 \
              --bucket business-records \
              --name finance-ap

       This command produces no output.

       For  more  information, see Creating Access Points in the Amazon Simple
       Storage Service Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       AccessPointArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the access point.

          NOTE:
              This is only supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       Alias -> (string)
          The name or alias of the access point.
