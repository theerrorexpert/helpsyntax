LIST-ACCESS-POINTS-FOR-OBJECT-LAMBDA()  LIST-ACCESS-POINTS-FOR-OBJECT-LAMBDA()



NAME
       list-access-points-for-object-lambda -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of the access points associated with the Object Lambda
       Access Point. You can retrieve up to 1000 access points  per  call.  If
       there  are  more  than  1,000 access points (or the number specified in
       maxResults , whichever is less), the response will include a  continua-
       tion token that you can use to list the additional access points.

       The following actions are related to ListAccessPointsForObjectLambda :

       o CreateAccessPointForObjectLambda

       o DeleteAccessPointForObjectLambda

       o GetAccessPointForObjectLambda

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-access-points-for-object-lambda is a paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: ObjectLambdaAccessPointList

SYNOPSIS
            list-access-points-for-object-lambda
          --account-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The account ID for the account that owns the specified Object Lambda
          Access Point.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ObjectLambdaAccessPointList -> (list)
          Returns list of Object Lambda Access Points.

          (structure)
              An access point with an attached Lambda function used to  access
              transformed data from an Amazon S3 bucket.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the Object Lambda Access Point.

              ObjectLambdaAccessPointArn -> (string)
                 Specifies the ARN for the Object Lambda Access Point.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the list has more access points than can be returned in one call
          to this API, this field contains a continuation token that  you  can
          provide  in  subsequent  calls  to  this  API to retrieve additional
          access points.
