       put-multi-region-access-point-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  an  access  control  policy with the specified Multi-Region
       Access Point. Each Multi-Region Access Point can have only one  policy,

       associated with the specified Multi-Region Access Point.

       This action will always be routed to the US West (Oregon)  Region.  For
       more  information  about  the restrictions around managing Multi-Region
       Access Points, see Managing Multi-Region Access Points in the Amazon S3

SYNOPSIS
            put-multi-region-access-point-policy
          --account-id <value>
          [--client-token <value>]
          --details <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID for the owner of the Multi-Region
          Access Point.

       --client-token (string)
          An idempotency token used to identify the request and guarantee that
          requests are unique.

       --details (structure)
          A  container  element  containing  the details of the policy for the
          Multi-Region Access Point.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the Multi-Region Access Point  associated  with  the
              request.

          Policy -> (string)
              The policy details for the PutMultiRegionAccessPoint request.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Policy=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Name": "string",
            "Policy": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RequestTokenARN -> (string)
          The  request  token  associated  with  the request. You can use this
          token with DescribeMultiRegionAccessPointOperation to determine  the
          status of asynchronous requests.
