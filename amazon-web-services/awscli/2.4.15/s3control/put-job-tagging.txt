PUT-JOB-TAGGING()                                            PUT-JOB-TAGGING()



NAME
       put-job-tagging -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets the supplied tag-set on an S3 Batch Operations job.

       A  tag  is a key-value pair. You can associate S3 Batch Operations tags
       with any job by sending a PUT request against the  tagging  subresource
       that  is  associated  with the job. To modify the existing tag set, you
       can either replace the existing  tag  set  entirely,  or  make  changes
       within  the  existing  tag set by retrieving the existing tag set using
       GetJobTagging , modify that tag set, and use this action to replace the
       tag   set  with  the  one  you  modified.  For  more  information,  see
       Controlling access and labeling jobs using tags in the Amazon  S3  User
       Guide .

       NOTE:

          o If  you send this request with an empty tag set, Amazon S3 deletes
            the existing tag set on the Batch Operations job. If you use  this
            method,  you  are  charged  for  a  Tier 1 Request (PUT). For more
            information, see Amazon S3 pricing .

          o For deleting existing  tags  for  your  Batch  Operations  job,  a
            DeleteJobTagging request is preferred because it achieves the same
            result without incurring charges.

          o A few things to consider about using tags:

            o Amazon S3 limits the maximum number of tags to 50 tags per  job.

            o You  can associate up to 50 tags with a job as long as they have
              unique tag keys.

            o A tag key can be up to 128 Unicode characters in length, and tag
              values can be up to 256 Unicode characters in length.

            o The key and values are case sensitive.

            o For  tagging-related  restrictions  related  to  characters  and
              encodings, see User-Defined Tag Restrictions in the Billing  and
              Cost Management User Guide .

       To  use this action, you must have permission to perform the s3:PutJob-
       Tagging action.

SYNOPSIS
            put-job-tagging
          --account-id <value>
          --job-id <value>
          --tags <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID  associated  with  the  S3  Batch
          Operations job.

       --job-id (string)
          The  ID  for  the  S3  Batch  Operations  job whose tags you want to
          replace.

       --tags (list)
          The set of tags to associate with the S3 Batch Operations job.

          (structure)
              Key -> (string)

              Value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
