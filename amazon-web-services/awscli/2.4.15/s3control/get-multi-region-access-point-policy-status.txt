SYNOPSIS
            get-multi-region-access-point-policy-status
          --account-id <value>
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID for the owner of the Multi-Region
          Access Point.

       --name (string)
          Specifies   the   Multi-Region   Access   Point.  The  name  of  the
          Multi-Region Access Point is different  from  the  alias.  For  more
          information  about the distinction between the name and the alias of
          an Multi-Region  Access  Point,  see  Managing  Multi-Region  Access
          Points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Established -> (structure)
          Indicates  whether  this  access  point  policy  is public. For more
          information about how Amazon  S3  evaluates  policies  to  determine
          whether  they  are public, see The Meaning of "Public" in the Amazon
          S3 User Guide .
