SYNOPSIS
            list-storage-lens-configurations
          --account-id <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The account ID of the requester.

       --next-token (string)
          A pagination token to request the next page of results.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If the request produced more than the maximum number of  S3  Storage
          Lens  configuration  results,  you can pass this value into a subse-
          quent request to retrieve the next page of results.

       StorageLensConfigurationList -> (list)
          A list of S3 Storage Lens configurations.

          (structure)
              Part of ListStorageLensConfigurationResult . Each entry includes
              the  description  of the S3 Storage Lens configuration, its home
              Region, whether it is enabled, its Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN),
              and config ID.

              Id -> (string)
