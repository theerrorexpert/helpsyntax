DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the  Amazon  S3 Storage Lens configuration. For more information,
       see Assessing your storage activity and usage with  Amazon  S3  Storage
       Lens in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       NOTE:
          To  use this action, you must have permission to perform the s3:Get-
          StorageLensConfiguration action. For more information,  see  Setting
          permissions  to  use  Amazon  S3  Storage Lens in the Amazon S3 User
          Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            get-storage-lens-configuration
          --config-id <value>
          --account-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --config-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon S3 Storage Lens configuration.

       --account-id (string)
          The account ID of the requester.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
