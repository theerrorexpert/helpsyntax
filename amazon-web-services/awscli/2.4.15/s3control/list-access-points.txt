LIST-ACCESS-POINTS()                                      LIST-ACCESS-POINTS()



NAME
       list-access-points -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of the access points currently associated with the spec-
       ified bucket. You can retrieve up to 1000 access points  per  call.  If
       the  specified  bucket has more than 1,000 access points (or the number
       specified in maxResults , whichever is less), the response will include
       a  continuation  token  that  you can use to list the additional access
       points.

       All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require  an
       additional  parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the request
       and an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of s3-control  .
       For  an  example  of  the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that
       uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname  prefix  and  the  x-amz-out-
       post-id derived using the access point ARN, see the Examples section.

       The following actions are related to ListAccessPoints :

       o CreateAccessPoint

       o DeleteAccessPoint

       o GetAccessPoint

SYNOPSIS
            list-access-points
          --account-id <value>
          [--bucket <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The  Amazon  Web  Services  account ID for owner of the bucket whose
          access points you want to list.

       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket whose associated access points  you  want  to
          list.

          For  using  this  parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST
          API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

          For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts  with  the  Amazon  Web
          Services  SDK  and  CLI,  you  must  specify  the  ARN of the bucket
          accessed        in        the         format         arn:aws:s3-out-
          posts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<out-
          post-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name> . For example, to access the bucket
          reports  through outpost my-outpost owned by account 123456789012 in
          Region  us-west-2  ,  use  the  URL  encoding   of   arn:aws:s3-out-
          posts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports . The
          value must be URL encoded.

       --next-token (string)
          A  continuation  token.  If  a  previous  call  to  ListAccessPoints
          returned a continuation token in the NextToken field, then providing
          that value here causes Amazon  S3  to  retrieve  the  next  page  of
          results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of access points that you want to include in the
          list. If the specified bucket has more than this  number  of  access
          points,  then  the response will include a continuation token in the
          NextToken field that you can use to retrieve the next page of access
          points.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                  }
              ]
          }

       Example 2: To retrieve a list of all access points for a bucket

       The following list-access-points example retrieves a list of all access
       points   attached   to   the  bucket  external-docs  owned  by  account
       123456789012.

          aws s3control list-access-points \
              --account-id 123456789012 \
              --bucket external-docs

       Output:

          {
              "AccessPointList": [
                  {
                      "Name": "customer-ap",
                      "NetworkOrigin": "Internet",
                      "Bucket": "external-docs"
                  },
                  {
                      "Name": "public-ap",
                      "NetworkOrigin": "Internet",
                      "Bucket": "external-docs"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       AccessPointList -> (list)
          Contains  identification  and  configuration  information for one or
          more access points associated with the specified bucket.

          (structure)
              An access point used to access a bucket.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of this access point.

              NetworkOrigin -> (string)
                 Indicates whether this access point allows  access  from  the
                 public  internet.  If  VpcConfiguration is specified for this
                 access point, then NetworkOrigin is  VPC  ,  and  the  access
                 point  doesn't  allow access from the public internet. Other-
                 wise, NetworkOrigin is Internet , and the access point allows
                 access  from the public internet, subject to the access point
                 and bucket access policies.

              VpcConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The virtual private cloud (VPC) configuration for this access
                 point, if one exists.

                 NOTE:
                     This  element  is empty if this access point is an Amazon
                     S3 on Outposts access point that is used by other  Amazon
                     Web Services.

                 VpcId -> (string)
                     If  this  field is specified, this access point will only
                     allow connections from the specified VPC ID.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The name of the bucket associated with this access point.

              AccessPointArn -> (string)
                 The ARN for the access point.

              Alias -> (string)
                 The name or alias of the access point.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the specified bucket has more access points than can be  returned
          in  one  call  to this API, this field contains a continuation token
          that you can provide in subsequent calls to  this  API  to  retrieve
          additional access points.
