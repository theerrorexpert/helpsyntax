DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  Multi-Region Access Point and associates it with the speci-
       fied buckets. For more information about creating  Multi-Region  Access
       Points,  see  Creating Multi-Region Access Points in the Amazon S3 User
       Guide .

       This action will always be routed to the US West (Oregon)  Region.  For

       Access Points, see Managing Multi-Region Access Points in the Amazon S3
       User Guide .

       This request is asynchronous, meaning that you might receive a response
       before  the  command  has  completed.  When  this  request  provides  a
       response, it provides a token that you can use to monitor the status of
       the request with DescribeMultiRegionAccessPointOperation .

SYNOPSIS
            create-multi-region-access-point
          --account-id <value>
          [--client-token <value>]
          --details <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID for the owner of the Multi-Region
          Access  Point.  The owner of the Multi-Region Access Point also must
          own the underlying buckets.

       --client-token (string)
          An idempotency token used to identify the request and guarantee that
          requests are unique.

       --details (structure)
          A container element containing details about the Multi-Region Access
          Point.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the Multi-Region Access Point associated  with  this
              request.

          PublicAccessBlock -> (structure)
              The  PublicAccessBlock  configuration  that you want to apply to
              this Amazon S3 account. You can enable the configuration options
              in  any  combination.  For more information about when Amazon S3
              considers a bucket or object public, see The Meaning of "Public"
              in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

              This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

              BlockPublicAcls -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether  Amazon S3 should block public access con-
                 trol lists (ACLs) for buckets in this account.  Setting  this
                 element to TRUE causes the following behavior:

                 o PUT  Bucket acl and PUT Object acl calls fail if the speci-
                   fied ACL is public.

                 o PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

                 o PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

                 Enabling this setting doesn't  affect  existing  policies  or
                 ACLs.

                 This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

              IgnorePublicAcls -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether  Amazon  S3  should ignore public ACLs for
                 buckets in this account. Setting this element to TRUE  causes
                 Amazon  S3  to  ignore  all  public  ACLs  on buckets in this
                 account and any objects that they contain.

                 Enabling this setting doesn't affect the persistence  of  any
                 existing  ACLs and doesn't prevent new public ACLs from being
                 set.

                 This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

              BlockPublicPolicy -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket  poli-
                 cies  for  buckets  in  this account. Setting this element to
                 TRUE causes Amazon S3 to reject calls to PUT Bucket policy if
                 the specified bucket policy allows public access.

                 Enabling  this  setting  doesn't affect existing bucket poli-
                 cies.

                 This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

              RestrictPublicBuckets -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether Amazon S3  should  restrict  public  bucket
                 policies for buckets in this account. Setting this element to
                 TRUE restricts access to buckets with public policies to only
                 Amazon  Web  Service  principals  and authorized users within
                 this account.

                 Enabling this setting doesn't affect previously stored bucket
                 policies,  except that public and cross-account access within
                 any public bucket policy, including non-public delegation  to
                 specific accounts, is blocked.

                 This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          Regions -> (list)
              The  buckets  in  different Regions that are associated with the
              Multi-Region Access Point.

              (structure)
                 A Region that supports a Multi-Region Access Point as well as
                 the associated bucket for the Region.

                 Bucket -> (string)
                     The name of the associated bucket for the Region.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,PublicAccessBlock={BlockPublicAcls=boolean,IgnorePublicAcls=boolean,BlockPublicPolicy=boolean,RestrictPublicBuckets=boolean},Regions=[{Bucket=string},{Bucket=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Name": "string",
            "PublicAccessBlock": {
              "BlockPublicAcls": true|false,
              "IgnorePublicAcls": true|false,
              "BlockPublicPolicy": true|false,
              "RestrictPublicBuckets": true|false
            },
            "Regions": [
              {
                "Bucket": "string"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RequestTokenARN -> (string)
          The  request  token  associated  with  the request. You can use this
          token with DescribeMultiRegionAccessPointOperation to determine  the
          status of asynchronous requests.
