NAME
       put-bucket-lifecycle-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This  action  puts a lifecycle configuration to an Amazon S3 on Out-
          posts bucket. To put a lifecycle configuration to an S3 bucket,  see
          PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration in the Amazon S3 API Reference .

       Creates  a new lifecycle configuration for the S3 on Outposts bucket or
       replaces an existing lifecycle  configuration.  Outposts  buckets  only
       support  lifecycle  configurations  that  delete/expire objects after a
       certain period of time and abort incomplete multipart uploads.

       All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require  an
       additional  parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the request
       and an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of s3-control  .
       For  an  example  of  the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that
       uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname  prefix  and  the  x-amz-out-
       post-id derived using the access point ARN, see the Examples section.

       The following actions are related to PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration :

       o GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration

       o DeleteBucketLifecycleConfiguration

          --account-id <value>
          --bucket <value>
          [--lifecycle-configuration <value>]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID of the Outposts bucket.

       --bucket (string)
          The name of the bucket for which to set the configuration.

       --lifecycle-configuration (structure)
          Container for lifecycle rules. You can add as many as 1,000 rules.

          Rules -> (list)
              A lifecycle rule for individual objects in an Outposts bucket.

              (structure)
                 The container for the Outposts bucket lifecycle rule.

                 Expiration -> (structure)
                     Specifies  the expiration for the lifecycle of the object
                     in the form of date, days and, whether the object  has  a
                     delete marker.

                     Date -> (timestamp)
                        Indicates  at  what  date the object is to be deleted.
                        Should be in GMT ISO 8601 format.

                     Days -> (integer)
                        Indicates the lifetime, in days, of the  objects  that
                        are  subject to the rule. The value must be a non-zero

                        marker  with  no  noncurrent versions. If set to true,
                        the delete marker will be expired. If  set  to  false,
                        the  policy  takes no action. This cannot be specified
                        with Days or Date in a Lifecycle Expiration Policy.

                 ID -> (string)
                     Unique identifier for  the  rule.  The  value  cannot  be

                     describes when noncurrent objects transition  to  a  spe-
                     cific storage class. If your bucket is versioning-enabled
                     (or versioning is suspended), you can set this action  to
                     request  that Amazon S3 transition noncurrent object ver-
                     sions to a specific storage class at a set period in  the
                     object's lifetime.

                            action. For information about the noncurrent  days

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.
