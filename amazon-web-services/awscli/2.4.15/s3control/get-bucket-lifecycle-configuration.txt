NAME
       get-bucket-lifecycle-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This action gets an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket's lifecycle config-
          uration.  To  get  an  S3  bucket's  lifecycle  configuration,   see
          GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration in the Amazon S3 API Reference .

       Returns  the  lifecycle  configuration  information set on the Outposts
       bucket. For more information, see Using Amazon S3 on Outposts  and  for
       information about lifecycle configuration, see Object Lifecycle Manage-
       ment in Amazon S3 User Guide .

       To use this action, you must have permission  to  perform  the  s3-out-
       posts:GetLifecycleConfiguration  action.  The Outposts bucket owner has
       this permission, by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission
       to  others.  For  more  information  about permissions, see Permissions
       Related to Bucket Subresource Operations and  Managing  Access  Permis-
       sions to Your Amazon S3 Resources .

       All  Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an
       additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the  request
       and  an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of s3-control .
       For an example of the request syntax for Amazon  S3  on  Outposts  that
       uses  the  S3  on  Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the x-amz-out-
       post-id derived using the access point ARN, see the Examples section.
          GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration has the following special error:

       o Error code: NoSuchLifecycleConfiguration

         o Description: The lifecycle configuration does not exist.

         o HTTP Status Code: 404 Not Found

         o SOAP Fault Code Prefix: Client

       The following actions are related to GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration :

       o DeleteBucketLifecycleConfiguration

SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket-lifecycle-configuration
          --account-id <value>
          --bucket <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID of the Outposts bucket.

       --bucket (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the bucket.

          For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts  with  the  REST
          API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

          For  using  this  parameter  with S3 on Outposts with the Amazon Web
          Services SDK and CLI,  you  must  specify  the  ARN  of  the  bucket
          accessed         in         the        format        arn:aws:s3-out-
          posts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<out-
          post-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name> . For example, to access the bucket
          reports through outpost my-outpost owned by account 123456789012  in
          Region   us-west-2   ,  use  the  URL  encoding  of  arn:aws:s3-out-
          posts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports . The
          value must be URL encoded.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 sioning  is  suspended),  you  can set this action to request
                 that Amazon S3 transition noncurrent  object  versions  to  a
                 specific  storage class at a set period in the object's life-
                 time.
