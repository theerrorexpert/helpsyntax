GET-BUCKET-TAGGING()                                      GET-BUCKET-TAGGING()



NAME
       get-bucket-tagging -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This  action  gets an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket's tags. To get an
          S3 bucket tags, see GetBucketTagging in the Amazon S3 API  Reference
          .

       Returns  the  tag  set  associated  with  the Outposts bucket. For more
       information, see Using Amazon S3 on Outposts  in  the  Amazon  S3  User
       Guide .

       To  use this action, you must have permission to perform the GetBucket-
       Tagging action. By default, the bucket owner has  this  permission  and
       can grant this permission to others.
          GetBucketTagging has the following special error:

       o Error code: NoSuchTagSetError

         o Description: There is no tag set associated with the bucket.

       All  Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an
       additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the  request
       and  an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of s3-control .
       For an example of the request syntax for Amazon  S3  on  Outposts  that
       uses  the  S3  on  Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the x-amz-out-
       post-id derived using the access point ARN, see the Examples section.

       The following actions are related to GetBucketTagging :

SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket-tagging
          --account-id <value>
          --bucket <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID of the Outposts bucket.

       --bucket (string)
          Specifies the bucket.

          For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts  with  the  REST
          API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

          For  using  this  parameter  with S3 on Outposts with the Amazon Web
          Services SDK and CLI,  you  must  specify  the  ARN  of  the  bucket
          accessed         in         the        format        arn:aws:s3-out-
          posts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<out-
          post-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name> . For example, to access the bucket
          reports through outpost my-outpost owned by account 123456789012  in
          Region   us-west-2   ,  use  the  URL  encoding  of  arn:aws:s3-out-
          posts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports . The
          value must be URL encoded.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TagSet -> (list)
          The tags set of the Outposts bucket.
