GET-BUCKET()                                                      GET-BUCKET()



NAME
       get-bucket -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  an  Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket. For more information, see Using
       Amazon S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

       If you are using an identity other than the root user of the Amazon Web
       Services  account  that  owns the Outposts bucket, the calling identity
       must have the s3-outposts:GetBucket permissions on the  specified  Out-
       posts bucket and belong to the Outposts bucket owner's account in order
       to use this action. Only users from Outposts bucket owner account  with
       the right permissions can perform actions on an Outposts bucket.

       If you don't have s3-outposts:GetBucket permissions or you're not using
       an identity that belongs to  the  bucket  owner's  account,  Amazon  S3
       returns a 403 Access Denied error.

       The  following  actions  are related to GetBucket for Amazon S3 on Out-
       posts:

       All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require  an
       additional  parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the request
       and an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of s3-control  .
       For  an  example  of  the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that
       uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname  prefix  and  the  x-amz-out-
       post-id derived using the access point ARN, see the Examples section.

SYNOPSIS
            get-bucket
          --account-id <value>
          --bucket <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID of the Outposts bucket.

       --bucket (string)
          Specifies the bucket.

          For  using  this  parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST
          API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

          For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts  with  the  Amazon  Web
          Services  SDK  and  CLI,  you  must  specify  the  ARN of the bucket
          accessed        in        the         format         arn:aws:s3-out-
          posts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<out-
          post-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name> . For example, to access the bucket
          reports  through outpost my-outpost owned by account 123456789012 in
          Region  us-west-2  ,  use  the  URL  encoding   of   arn:aws:s3-out-
          posts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports . The
          value must be URL encoded.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
