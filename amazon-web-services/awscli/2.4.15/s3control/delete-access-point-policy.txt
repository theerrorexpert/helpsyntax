DELETE-ACCESS-POINT-POLICY()                      DELETE-ACCESS-POINT-POLICY()



NAME
       delete-access-point-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the access point policy for the specified access point.

       All  Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an
       additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the  request
       and  an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of s3-control .
       For an example of the request syntax for Amazon  S3  on  Outposts  that
       uses  the  S3  on  Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the x-amz-out-
       post-id derived using the access point ARN, see the Examples section.

       The following actions are related to DeleteAccessPointPolicy :

       o PutAccessPointPolicy

       o GetAccessPointPolicy

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-access-point-policy
          --account-id <value>
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The account ID for the account that owns the specified access point.

       --name (string)
          The name of the access point whose policy you want to delete.

          For  using  this  parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST
          API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

          For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts  with  the  Amazon  Web
          Services  SDK  and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the access point
          accessed        in        the         format         arn:aws:s3-out-
          posts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/access-
          point/<my-accesspoint-name> . For  example,  to  access  the  access
          point   reports-ap  through  outpost  my-outpost  owned  by  account
          123456789012  in  Region  us-west-2  ,  use  the  URL  encoding   of
          arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-out-
          post/accesspoint/reports-ap . The value must be URL encoded.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete an access point policy

       The following delete-access-point-policy  example  deletes  the  access
       point  policy  from  the  access  point  named  finance-ap  in  account
       123456789012. Before running this example,  replace  the  access  point
       name and account number with appropriate values for your use case.

          aws s3control delete-access-point-policy \
              --account-id 123456789012 \
              --name finance-ap

       This command produces no output.
