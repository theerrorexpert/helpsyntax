SYNOPSIS
            get-access-point-for-object-lambda
          --account-id <value>
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The account ID for the account that owns the specified Object Lambda
          Access Point.

       --name (string)
          The name of the Object Lambda Access Point.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Name -> (string)
          The name of the Object Lambda Access Point.

       PublicAccessBlockConfiguration -> (structure)
          Configuration  to block all public access. This setting is turned on
          and can not be edited.

          BlockPublicAcls -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public  access  control
              lists  (ACLs)  for buckets in this account. Setting this element
              to TRUE causes the following behavior:

              o PUT Bucket acl and PUT Object acl calls fail if the  specified
                ACL is public.

              o PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

              o PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

              Enabling  this setting doesn't affect existing policies or ACLs.

              This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          IgnorePublicAcls -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs for  buck-
              ets  in this account. Setting this element to TRUE causes Amazon
              S3 to ignore all public ACLs on buckets in this account and  any
              objects that they contain.

              Enabling  this  setting  doesn't  affect  the persistence of any
              existing ACLs and doesn't prevent new  public  ACLs  from  being
              set.

              This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          BlockPublicPolicy -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket policies
              for buckets in this account. Setting this element to TRUE causes
              Amazon  S3 to reject calls to PUT Bucket policy if the specified
              bucket policy allows public access.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing bucket policies.

              This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

          RestrictPublicBuckets -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether Amazon S3 should restrict public bucket  poli-
              cies  for  buckets in this account. Setting this element to TRUE
              restricts access to buckets with public policies to only  Amazon
              Web Service principals and authorized users within this account.

              Enabling this setting doesn't affect  previously  stored  bucket
              policies, except that public and cross-account access within any
              public bucket policy, including non-public  delegation  to  spe-
              cific accounts, is blocked.

              This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

       CreationDate -> (timestamp)
          The  date and time when the specified Object Lambda Access Point was
          created.
