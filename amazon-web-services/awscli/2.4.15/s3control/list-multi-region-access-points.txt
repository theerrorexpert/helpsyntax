DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of the Multi-Region Access Points currently associated
       with the specified Amazon Web Services account. Each call can return up
       to  100  Multi-Region Access Points, the maximum number of Multi-Region
       Access Points that can be associated with a single account.

       This action will always be routed to the US West (Oregon)  Region.  For
       more  information  about  the restrictions around managing Multi-Region
       Access Points, see Managing Multi-Region Access Points in the Amazon S3
       User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            list-multi-region-access-points
          --account-id <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID for the owner of the Multi-Region
          Access Point.

       --next-token (string)
          Not currently used. Do not use this parameter.

       --max-results (integer)
          Not currently used. Do not use this parameter.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AccessPoints -> (list)
          The list of Multi-Region Access Points associated with the user.

          (structure)
              A collection of statuses for a Multi-Region Access Point in  the
              various Regions it supports.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the Multi-Region Access Point.

              Alias -> (string)
                 The  alias for the Multi-Region Access Point. For more infor-
                 mation about the distinction between the name and  the  alias
                 of  an  Multi-Region  Access Point, see Managing Multi-Region
                 Access Points .

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 When  the  Multi-Region  Access  Point  create  request   was
                 received.

              PublicAccessBlock -> (structure)
                 The PublicAccessBlock configuration that you want to apply to
                 this Amazon S3 account.  You  can  enable  the  configuration
                 options  in  any combination. For more information about when
                 Amazon S3 considers a bucket or object public, see The  Mean-
                 ing of "Public" in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

                 This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

                 BlockPublicAcls -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether  Amazon  S3 should block public access
                     control lists (ACLs) for buckets in this account. Setting
                     this element to TRUE causes the following behavior:

                     o PUT  Bucket  acl  and  PUT Object acl calls fail if the
                       specified ACL is public.

                     o PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a  public
                       ACL.

                     o PUT  Bucket calls fail if the request includes a public
                       ACL.

                     Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing policies or
                     ACLs.

                     This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

                 IgnorePublicAcls -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs for
                     buckets in this account. Setting  this  element  to  TRUE
                     causes  Amazon S3 to ignore all public ACLs on buckets in
                     this account and any objects that they contain.

                     Enabling this setting doesn't affect the  persistence  of
                     any  existing  ACLs  and  doesn't prevent new public ACLs
                     from being set.

                     This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

                 BlockPublicPolicy -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether Amazon S3 should  block  public  bucket
                     policies  for  buckets in this account. Setting this ele-
                     ment to TRUE causes Amazon S3  to  reject  calls  to  PUT
                     Bucket  policy if the specified bucket policy allows pub-
                     lic access.

                     Enabling this  setting  doesn't  affect  existing  bucket
                     policies.

                     This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

                 RestrictPublicBuckets -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether Amazon S3 should restrict public bucket
                     policies for buckets in this account. Setting  this  ele-
                     ment  to  TRUE  restricts  access  to buckets with public
                     policies to only Amazon Web Service principals and autho-
                     rized users within this account.

                     Enabling  this  setting  doesn't affect previously stored
                     bucket policies, except  that  public  and  cross-account
                     access   within   any  public  bucket  policy,  including
                     non-public delegation to specific accounts, is blocked.

                     This is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current status of the Multi-Region Access Point.
                     CREATING and DELETING are  temporary  states  that  exist
                     while  the request is propogating and being completed. If
                     a  Multi-Region  Access  Point  has  a  status  of   PAR-
                     TIALLY_CREATED , you can retry creation or send a request
                     to  delete  the   Multi-Region   Access   Point.   If   a
                     Multi-Region   Access   Point   has   a  status  of  PAR-
                     TIALLY_DELETED , you can retry a delete request to finish
                     the deletion of the Multi-Region Access Point.

              Regions -> (list)
                 A  collection  of the Regions and buckets associated with the
                 Multi-Region Access Point.

                 (structure)
                     A combination of a bucket and Region  that's  part  of  a
                     Multi-Region Access Point.

                     Bucket -> (string)
                        The name of the bucket.

                     Region -> (string)
                        The name of the Region.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the specified bucket has more Multi-Region Access Points than can
          be returned in one call to this action, this field contains  a  con-
          tinuation token. You can use this token tin subsequent calls to this
          action to retrieve additional Multi-Region Access Points.
