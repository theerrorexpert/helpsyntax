DESCRIPTION
       AWS  IoT  Jobs  is  a  service  that allows you to define a set of jobs
       remote operations that are sent to and executed on one or more  devices
       connected  to AWS IoT. For example, you can define a job that instructs
       a set of devices  to  download  and  install  application  or  firmware
       updates, reboot, rotate certificates, or perform remote troubleshooting
       operations.

       To create a job, you make a job document which is a description of  the
       remote  operations  to  be performed, and you specify a list of targets
       that should perform the  operations.  The  targets  can  be  individual
       things, thing groups or both.

       AWS IoT Jobs sends a message to inform the targets that a job is avail-
       able. The target starts the execution of the job by downloading the job
       document,  performing  the  operations  it specifies, and reporting its
       progress to AWS IoT. The Jobs service provides commands  to  track  the
       progress  of  a job on a specific target and for all the targets of the
       job
