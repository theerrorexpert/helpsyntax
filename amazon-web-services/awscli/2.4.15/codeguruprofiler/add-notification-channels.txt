NAME
       add-notification-channels -

DESCRIPTION
       Add up to 2 anomaly notifications channels for a profiling group.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            add-notification-channels
          --channels <value>
          --profiling-group-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channels (list)
          One or 2 channels to report to when anomalies are detected.

          (structure)
              Notification  medium  for  users  to get alerted for events that
              occur in application profile. We support SNS topic as a  notifi-
              cation channel.

              eventPublishers -> (list)
                 List  of  publishers for different type of events that may be
                 detected in an application from the profile.  Anomaly  detec-
                 tion is the only event publisher in Profiler.

                 (string)

              id -> (string)
                 Unique  identifier  for each Channel in the notification con-
                 figuration of a Profiling Group. A random UUID for  channelId
                 is  used when adding a channel to the notification configura-
                 tion if not specified in the request.

              uri -> (string)
                 Unique arn of the resource to be used for  notifications.  We
                 support a valid SNS topic arn as a channel uri.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          eventPublishers=string,string,id=string,uri=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "eventPublishers": ["AnomalyDetection", ...],
              "id": "string",
              "uri": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --profiling-group-name (string)
          The name of the profiling group that we are setting up notifications
          for.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       notificationConfiguration -> (structure)
          The new notification configuration for this profiling group.

          channels -> (list)
              List of up to two channels to be used for sending  notifications
              for events detected from the application profile.

              (structure)
                 Notification  medium for users to get alerted for events that
                 occur in application profile. We support SNS topic as a noti-
                 fication channel.

                 eventPublishers -> (list)
                     List  of publishers for different type of events that may
                     be detected in an application from the  profile.  Anomaly
                     detection is the only event publisher in Profiler.

                     (string)

                 id -> (string)
                     Unique  identifier  for  each Channel in the notification
                     configuration of a Profiling Group.  A  random  UUID  for
                     channelId  is used when adding a channel to the notifica-
                     tion configuration if not specified in the request.

                 uri -> (string)
                     Unique arn of the resource to be used for  notifications.
                     We support a valid SNS topic arn as a channel uri.
