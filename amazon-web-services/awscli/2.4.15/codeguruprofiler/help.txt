DESCRIPTION
       This  section  provides  documentation for the Amazon CodeGuru Profiler
       API operations.

       Amazon CodeGuru Profiler collects runtime performance  data  from  your
       live  applications,  and  provides  recommendations  that  can help you
       fine-tune your application performance. Using  machine  learning  algo-
       rithms,  CodeGuru  Profiler can help you find your most expensive lines
       of code and suggest ways you can improve efficiency and remove CPU bot-
       tlenecks.

       Amazon CodeGuru Profiler provides different visualizations of profiling
       data to help you identify what code is running on the CPU, see how much
       time is consumed, and suggest ways to reduce CPU utilization.

       NOTE:
          Amazon  CodeGuru Profiler currently supports applications written in
          all Java virtual machine (JVM) languages and Python. While  CodeGuru
          Profiler supports both visualizations and recommendations for appli-
          cations written in Java, it can also generate visualizations  and  a
          subset of recommendations for applications written in other JVM lan-
          guages and Python.

       For more information, see What is Amazon CodeGuru Profiler in the  Ama-
       zon CodeGuru Profiler User Guide .
