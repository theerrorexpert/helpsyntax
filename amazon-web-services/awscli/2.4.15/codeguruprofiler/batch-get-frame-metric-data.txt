          [--frame-metrics <value>]
          [--period <value>]
          --profiling-group-name <value>

OPTIONS
       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end time of the time period for the returned time series values.
          This   is   specified  using  the  ISO  8601  format.  For  example,
          2020-06-01T13:15:02.001Z represents 1 millisecond past June 1,  2020
          1:15:02 PM UTC.

       --frame-metrics (list)
          The details of the metrics that are used to request a time series of
          values. The metric includes the name of the frame,  the  aggregation
          type  to  calculate  the  metric value for the frame, and the thread
          states to use to get the count for the metric value of the frame.

          (structure)
              The frame name, metric type, and thread states. These  are  used
              to derive the value of the metric for the frame.

              frameName -> (string)
                 Name  of the method common across the multiple occurrences of
                 a frame in an application profile.

              threadStates -> (list)
                 List of application runtime thread states  used  to  get  the
                 counts for a frame a derive a metric value.

                 (string)

              type -> (string)
                 A type of aggregation that specifies how a metric for a frame
                 is analyzed. The supported value  AggregatedRelativeTotalTime
                 is  an  aggregation of the metric value for one frame that is
                 calculated across the occurrences of all frames in a profile.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          frameName=string,threadStates=string,string,type=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "frameName": "string",
              "threadStates": ["string", ...],
              "type": "AggregatedRelativeTotalTime"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --period (string)
          The  duration  of  the  frame metrics used to return the time series
          values. Specify using the ISO 8601 format. The maximum period  dura-
          tion is one day (PT24H or P1D ).

       --profiling-group-name (string)
          The  name  of the profiling group associated with the the frame met-
          rics used to return the time series values.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The start time of the time period for  the  frame  metrics  used  to
          return  the time series values. This is specified using the ISO 8601
          format. For example, 2020-06-01T13:15:02.001Z represents 1 millisec-
          ond past June 1, 2020 1:15:02 PM UTC.

       --target-resolution (string)
          The  requested resolution of time steps for the returned time series
          of values. If the requested target resolution is not  available  due
          to  data  not  being  retained  we  provide  a best effort result by
          falling back to the most granular  available  resolution  after  the
          target resolution. There are 3 valid values.

          o P1D  1 day

          o PT1H  1 hour

          o PT5M  5 minutes

          Possible values:

          o PT5M

          o PT1H

          o P1D

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       endTime -> (timestamp)

                     tiveTotalTime  is  an aggregation of the metric value for
                     one frame that is calculated across  the  occurrences  of
