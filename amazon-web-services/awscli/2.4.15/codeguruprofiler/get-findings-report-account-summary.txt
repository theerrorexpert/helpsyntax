DESCRIPTION
       Returns       a       list       of       `       FindingsReportSummary
       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/profiler-api/API_FindingsReportSummary.html`__
       objects  that contain analysis results for all profiling groups in your
       AWS account.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-findings-report-account-summary
          [--daily-reports-only | --no-daily-reports-only]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --daily-reports-only | --no-daily-reports-only (boolean)
          A Boolean value indicating whether to only return reports from daily
          profiles. If set to True , only analysis data from daily profiles is
          returned. If set to False , analysis data is returned  from  smaller
          time windows (for example, one hour).

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  results  returned  by GetFindingsReportAc-
          countSummary in paginated  output.  When  this  parameter  is  used,
          GetFindingsReportAccountSummary only returns maxResults results in a
          single page along with a nextToken response element.  The  remaining
          results  of  the  initial  request  can  be  seen by sending another
          GetFindingsReportAccountSummary request with the returned  nextToken
          value.

       --next-token (string)
          The  nextToken  value  returned  from  a previous paginated GetFind-
          ingsReportAccountSummary request where maxResults was used  and  the
          results  exceeded  the value of that parameter. Pagination continues
          from the end of the previous results  that  returned  the  nextToken
          value.

          NOTE:
              This  token  should  be  treated as an opaque identifier that is
              only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other
              programmatic purposes.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          The  nextToken  value  to  include  in a future GetFindingsReportAc-
          countSummary request. When the  results  of  a  GetFindingsReportAc-
          countSummary  request  exceed maxResults , this value can be used to
          retrieve the next page of results. This value is null when there are
          no more results to return.

       reportSummaries -> (list)
          The       return      list      of      `      FindingsReportSummary
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/profiler-api/API_FindingsReportSummary.html`__
          objects taht contain summaries of analysis results for all profiling
          groups in your AWS account.

          (structure)
              Information about potential recommendations that might  be  cre-
              ated from the analysis of profiling data.

              id -> (string)
                 The  universally  unique identifier (UUID) of the recommenda-
                 tion report.

              profileEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The end time of the period during which the metric is flagged
                 as  anomalous.  This  is specified using the ISO 8601 format.
                 For example, 2020-06-01T13:15:02.001Z represents 1  millisec-
                 ond past June 1, 2020 1:15:02 PM UTC.

              profileStartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  start  time  of  the profile the analysis data is about.
                 This is specified using the ISO  8601  format.  For  example,
                 2020-06-01T13:15:02.001Z  represents  1 millisecond past June
                 1, 2020 1:15:02 PM UTC.

              profilingGroupName -> (string)
                 The name of the profiling group that is associated  with  the
                 analysis data.

              totalNumberOfFindings -> (integer)
                 The total number of different recommendations that were found
                 by the analysis.
