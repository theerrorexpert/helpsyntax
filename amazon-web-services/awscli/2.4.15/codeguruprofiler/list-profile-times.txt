LIST-PROFILE-TIMES()                                      LIST-PROFILE-TIMES()



NAME
       list-profile-times -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the start times of the available aggregated profiles of a profil-
       ing group for an aggregation period within the specified time range.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-profile-times is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: profileTimes

SYNOPSIS
            list-profile-times
          --end-time <value>
          [--order-by <value>]
          --period <value>
          --profiling-group-name <value>
          --start-time <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end time of the time range from which to list the profiles.

       --order-by (string)
          The  order (ascending or descending by start time of the profile) to
          use when listing profiles. Defaults to TIMESTAMP_DESCENDING .

          Possible values:

          o TimestampDescending

          o TimestampAscending

       --period (string)
          The aggregation period. This specifies the period  during  which  an
          aggregation  profile  collects posted agent profiles for a profiling
          group. There are 3 valid values.

          o P1D  1 day

          o PT1H  1 hour

          o PT5M  5 minutes

          Possible values:

          o PT5M

          o PT1H

          o P1D

       --profiling-group-name (string)
          The name of the profiling group.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The start time of the time range from which to list the profiles.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken value to include in a future ListProfileTimes request.
          When the results of a ListProfileTimes request exceed  maxResults  ,
          this  value  can  be used to retrieve the next page of results. This
          value is null when there are no more results to return.

       profileTimes -> (list)
          The list of start times of the available profiles for  the  aggrega-
          tion period in the specified time range.

          (structure)
              Contains the start time of a profile.

              start -> (timestamp)
                 The  start  time  of a profile. It is specified using the ISO
                 8601 format. For example, 2020-06-01T13:15:02.001Z represents
                 1 millisecond past June 1, 2020 1:15:02 PM UTC.
