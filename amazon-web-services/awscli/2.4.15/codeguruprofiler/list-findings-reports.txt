NAME
       list-findings-reports -

DESCRIPTION
       List  the available reports for a given profiling group and time range.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-findings-reports
          [--daily-reports-only | --no-daily-reports-only]
          --end-time <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          --profiling-group-name <value>
          --start-time <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --daily-reports-only | --no-daily-reports-only (boolean)
          A Boolean value indicating whether to only return reports from daily
          profiles. If set to True , only analysis data from daily profiles is
          returned. If set to False , analysis data is returned  from  smaller
          time windows (for example, one hour).

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The  end  time  of  the profile to get analysis data about. You must
          specify startTime and endTime . This is specified using the ISO 8601
          format. For example, 2020-06-01T13:15:02.001Z represents 1 millisec-
          ond past June 1, 2020 1:15:02 PM UTC.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of report results returned by ListFindingsReports
          in  paginated  output.  When this parameter is used, ListFindingsRe-
          ports only returns maxResults results in a single page along with  a
          nextToken  response  element.  The  remaining results of the initial
          request can be seen by sending another  ListFindingsReports  request
          with the returned nextToken value.

       --next-token (string)
          The  nextToken  value  returned  from a previous paginated ListFind-
          ingsReportsRequest request where maxResults was used and the results
          exceeded  the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the
          end of the previous results that returned the nextToken value.

          NOTE:
              This token should be treated as an  opaque  identifier  that  is
              only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other
              programmatic purposes.

       --profiling-group-name (string)
          The name of the profiling group from which to  search  for  analysis
          data.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The  start  time of the profile to get analysis data about. You must
          specify startTime and endTime . This is specified using the ISO 8601
          format. For example, 2020-06-01T13:15:02.001Z represents 1 millisec-
          ond past June 1, 2020 1:15:02 PM UTC.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       findingsReportSummaries -> (list)
          The list of analysis results summaries.

          (structure)
              Information about potential recommendations that might  be  cre-
              ated from the analysis of profiling data.

              id -> (string)
                 The  universally  unique identifier (UUID) of the recommenda-
                 tion report.

              profileEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The end time of the period during which the metric is flagged
                 as  anomalous.  This  is specified using the ISO 8601 format.
                 For example, 2020-06-01T13:15:02.001Z represents 1  millisec-
                 ond past June 1, 2020 1:15:02 PM UTC.

              profileStartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  start  time  of  the profile the analysis data is about.
                 This is specified using the ISO  8601  format.  For  example,
                 2020-06-01T13:15:02.001Z  represents  1 millisecond past June
                 1, 2020 1:15:02 PM UTC.

              profilingGroupName -> (string)
                 The name of the profiling group that is associated  with  the
                 analysis data.

              totalNumberOfFindings -> (integer)
                 The total number of different recommendations that were found
                 by the analysis.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken value  to  include  in  a  future  ListFindingsReports
          request.  When  the  results of a ListFindingsReports request exceed
          maxResults , this value can be used to retrieve  the  next  page  of
          results.  This  value  is  null  when  there  are no more results to
          return.
