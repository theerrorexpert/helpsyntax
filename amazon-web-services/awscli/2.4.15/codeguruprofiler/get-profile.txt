GET-PROFILE()                                                    GET-PROFILE()



NAME
       get-profile -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the  aggregated profile of a profiling group for a specified time
       range. Amazon CodeGuru Profiler collects posted agent  profiles  for  a
       profiling group into aggregated profiles.
          <note>  <p>  Because aggregated profiles expire over time <code>Get-
          Profile</code> is not idempotent. </p> </note> <p> Specify the  time
          range  for the requested aggregated profile using 1 or 2 of the fol-
          lowing  parameters:  <code>startTime</code>,   <code>endTime</code>,
          <code>period</code>.  The  maximum  time range allowed is 7 days. If
          you specify all 3 parameters, an exception is thrown. If you specify
          only <code>period</code>, the latest aggregated profile is returned.
          </p> <p> Aggregated profiles are available with aggregation  periods
          of  5  minutes,  1  hour, and 1 day, aligned to UTC. The aggregation
          period of an aggregated profile determines how long it is  retained.
          For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/code-
          guru/latest/profiler-api/API_AggregatedProfileTime.html">
          <code>AggregatedProfileTime</code>  </a>.  The  aggregated profile's
          aggregation period determines how long it is  retained  by  CodeGuru
          Profiler. </p> <ul> <li> <p> If the aggregation period is 5 minutes,
          the aggregated profile is retained for 15 days. </p> </li> <li>  <p>
          If  the  aggregation  period  is  1  hour, the aggregated profile is
          retained for 60 days. </p> </li> <li> <p> If the aggregation  period
          is 1 day, the aggregated profile is retained for 3 years. </p> </li>
          </ul>  <p>There  are  two  use  cases  for   calling   <code>GetPro-
          file</code>.</p>  <ol>  <li> <p> If you want to return an aggregated
          profile that  already  exists,  use  <a  href="https://docs.aws.ama-
          zon.com/codeguru/latest/profiler-api/API_ListProfileTimes.html">
          <code>ListProfileTimes</code> </a> to view the time ranges of exist-
          ing  aggregated  profiles.  Use  them  in  a <code>GetProfile</code>
          request to return a  specific,  existing  aggregated  profile.  </p>
          </li>  <li>  <p>  If  you want to return an aggregated profile for a
          time range that doesn't align with an existing  aggregated  profile,
          then  CodeGuru  Profiler  makes  a  best  effort to combine existing
          aggregated profiles from the requested time range and return them as
          one aggregated profile. </p> <p> If aggregated profiles do not exist
          for the full time range requested, then aggregated  profiles  for  a
          smaller  time range are returned. For example, if the requested time
          range is from 00:00 to 00:20, and the existing  aggregated  profiles
          are from 00:15 and 00:25, then the aggregated profiles from 00:15 to
          00:20 are returned. </p> </li> </ol>

SYNOPSIS
            get-profile
          [--accept <value>]
          [--end-time <value>]
          [--max-depth <value>]
          [--period <value>]
          --profiling-group-name <value>
          [--start-time <value>]
          <outfile>

OPTIONS
       --accept (string)
          The format of the returned profiling data. The format  maps  to  the
          Accept and Content-Type headers of the HTTP request. You can specify
          one of the following: or the default .
              <ul> <li> <p> <code>application/json</code>  standard JSON  for-
              mat </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>application/x-amzn-ion</code>  the
              Amazon  Ion  data  format.  For   more   information,   see   <a
              href="http://amzn.github.io/ion-docs/">Amazon    Ion</a>.   </p>
              </li> </ul>

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end time of the requested profile. Specify using  the  ISO  8601
          format. For example, 2020-06-01T13:15:02.001Z represents 1 millisec-
          ond past June 1, 2020 1:15:02 PM UTC.

          If you specify endTime , then you must also specify period or start-
          Time , but not both.

       --max-depth (integer)
          The  maximum  depth of the stacks in the code that is represented in
          the aggregated profile. For example, if CodeGuru  Profiler  finds  a
          method A , which calls method B , which calls method C , which calls
          method D , then the depth is 4. If the maxDepth is set  to  2,  then
          the aggregated profile contains representations of methods A and B .

       --period (string)
          Used with startTime or endTime to specify the  time  range  for  the
          returned  aggregated profile. Specify using the ISO 8601 format. For
          example, P1DT1H1M1S .
              <p>  To  get  the  latest  aggregated  profile,   specify   only
              <code>period</code>. </p>

       --profiling-group-name (string)
          The name of the profiling group to get.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The  start  time  of  the profile to get. Specify using the ISO 8601
          format. For example, 2020-06-01T13:15:02.001Z represents 1 millisec-
          ond past June 1, 2020 1:15:02 PM UTC.
              <p>  If  you  specify <code>startTime</code>, then you must also
              specify <code>period</code>  or  <code>endTime</code>,  but  not
              both. </p>

       outfile (string) Filename where the content will be saved

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          cation/json or the default application/x-amzn-ion .
