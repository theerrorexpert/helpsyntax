OPTIONS
       --access-configuration (structure)
          Access  configuration parameters. Configures the type of authentica-
          tion used to access content from your source location.

          AccessType -> (string)
              The type of authentication used to access content from  HttpCon-
              figuration::BaseUrl  on  your  source  location. Accepted value:
              S3_SIGV4.

              S3_SIGV4 - AWS Signature Version 4 authentication for Amazon  S3
              hosted virtual-style access. If your source location base URL is
              an Amazon S3 bucket, MediaTailor can use AWS Signature Version 4
              (SigV4)  authentication  to  access the bucket where your source
              content is stored. Your MediaTailor source location baseURL must
              follow the S3 virtual hosted-style request URL format. For exam-
              ple, https://bucket-name.s3.Region.amazonaws.com/key-name.

              Before you can use S3_SIGV4, you must meet these requirements:

              o You must allow MediaTailor to access your S3 bucket by  grant-
                ing  mediatailor.amazonaws.com  principal  access  in IAM. For
                information about configuring access in IAM, see  Access  man-
                agement in the IAM User Guide.

              o The mediatailor.amazonaws.com service principal must have per-
                missions to read all top level  manifests  referenced  by  the
                VodSource packaging configurations.

              o The  caller  of the API must have s3:GetObject IAM permissions
                to read all top level manifests referenced by your MediaTailor
                VodSource packaging configurations.

          SecretsManagerAccessTokenConfiguration -> (structure)
              AWS Secrets Manager access token configuration parameters.

              HeaderName -> (string)
                 The  name  of the HTTP header used to supply the access token
                 in requests to the source location.

              SecretArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  AWS  Secrets  Manager
                 secret that contains the access token.

              SecretStringKey -> (string)
                 The  AWS Secrets Manager SecretString key associated with the
                 access token. MediaTailor uses the key  to  look  up  Secret-
                 String key and value pair containing the access token.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AccessType=string,SecretsManagerAccessTokenConfiguration={HeaderName=string,SecretArn=string,SecretStringKey=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AccessType": "S3_SIGV4"|"SECRETS_MANAGER_ACCESS_TOKEN",
            "SecretsManagerAccessTokenConfiguration": {
              "HeaderName": "string",
              "SecretArn": "string",
              "SecretStringKey": "string"
            }
          }

       --default-segment-delivery-configuration (structure)
          The optional configuration for the server that serves segments.

          BaseUrl -> (string)
              The  hostname of the server that will be used to serve segments.
              This string must include the protocol, such as https:// .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          BaseUrl=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "BaseUrl": "string"
          }

       --http-configuration (structure)
          The source's HTTP package configurations.

          BaseUrl -> (string)
              The base URL for the source location host  server.  This  string
              must include the protocol, such as https:// .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          BaseUrl=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "BaseUrl": "string"
          }

       --segment-delivery-configurations (list) (structure)
          BaseUrl -> (string)

          Name -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          BaseUrl=string,Name=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "BaseUrl": "string",
              "Name": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --source-location-name (string)
          The identifier for the source location you are working on.

       --tags (map)
          The tags to assign to the source location.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
