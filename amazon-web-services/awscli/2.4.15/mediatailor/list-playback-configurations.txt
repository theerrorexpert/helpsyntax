LIST-PLAYBACK-CONFIGURATIONS()                  LIST-PLAYBACK-CONFIGURATIONS()



NAME
       list-playback-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list of the playback configurations defined in AWS Elemental
       MediaTailor. You can specify a  maximum  number  of  configurations  to
       return  at  a  time. The default maximum is 50. Results are returned in
       pagefuls. If MediaTailor has more  configurations  than  the  specified
       maximum,  it  provides  parameters  in the response that you can use to
       retrieve the next pageful.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-playback-configurations is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: Items

SYNOPSIS
            list-playback-configurations
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Items -> (list)
          Array  of  playback  configurations. This might be all the available
          configurations or a subset, depending on the settings that you  pro-
          vide and the total number of configurations stored.

          (structure)
              Creates  a  playback  configuration. For information about Medi-
              aTailor configurations, see Working with configurations  in  AWS
              Elemental MediaTailor .

              AdDecisionServerUrl -> (string)
                 The  URL  for the ad decision server (ADS). This includes the
                 specification  of  static  parameters  and  placeholders  for
                 dynamic  parameters.  AWS  Elemental  MediaTailor substitutes
                 player-specific and  session-specific  parameters  as  needed
                 when  calling  the ADS. Alternately, for testing you can pro-
                 vide a static VAST URL. The maximum length is 25,000  charac-
                 ters.

              AvailSuppression -> (structure)
                 The  configuration  for  avail  suppression, also known as ad
                 suppression. For more information about ad  suppression,  see
                 Ad Suppression .

                 Mode -> (string)
                     Sets  the ad suppression mode. By default, ad suppression
                     is off and all ad breaks are filled with  ads  or  slate.
                     When  Mode  is set to BEHIND_LIVE_EDGE, ad suppression is
                     active and MediaTailor won't fill ad breaks on or  behind
                     the  ad  suppression  Value time in the manifest lookback
                     window.

                 Value -> (string)
                     A live edge offset time in  HH:MM:SS.  MediaTailor  won't
                     fill  ad  breaks  on  or behind this time in the manifest
                     lookback window. If Value is set to 00:00:00,  it  is  in
                     sync  with  the live edge, and MediaTailor won't fill any
                     ad breaks on or behind the live edge. If you set a  Value
                     time,  MediaTailor  won't fill any ad breaks on or behind
                     this time in the manifest lookback window.  For  example,
                     if you set 00:45:00, then MediaTailor will fill ad breaks
                     that occur within 45 minutes behind the  live  edge,  but
                     won't  fill  ad breaks on or behind 45 minutes behind the
                     live edge.

              Bumper -> (structure)
                 The configuration for bumpers. Bumpers  are  short  audio  or
                 video clips that play at the start or before the end of an ad
                 break. To learn more about bumpers, see Bumpers .

                 EndUrl -> (string)
                     The URL for the end bumper asset.

                 StartUrl -> (string)
                     The URL for the start bumper asset.

              CdnConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The configuration for using a content delivery network (CDN),
                 like  Amazon  CloudFront,  for content and ad segment manage-
                 ment.

                 AdSegmentUrlPrefix -> (string)
                     A non-default content delivery network (CDN) to serve  ad
                     segments. By default, AWS Elemental MediaTailor uses Ama-
                     zon CloudFront with default cache settings as its CDN for
                     ad segments. To set up an alternate CDN, create a rule in
                     your CDN for the origin  ads.mediatailor.&lt;region>.ama-
                     zonaws.com.  Then  specify the rule's name in this AdSeg-
                     mentUrlPrefix. When AWS Elemental  MediaTailor  serves  a
                     manifest,  it  reports your CDN as the source for ad seg-
                     ments.

                 ContentSegmentUrlPrefix -> (string)
                     A content delivery network (CDN) to  cache  content  seg-
                     ments, so that content requests dont always have to go to
                     the origin server. First, create a rule in your  CDN  for
                     the  content  segment  origin  server.  Then  specify the
                     rule's name in  this  ContentSegmentUrlPrefix.  When  AWS
                     Elemental  MediaTailor serves a manifest, it reports your
                     CDN as the source for content segments.

              ConfigurationAliases -> (map)
                 The player parameters and aliases used as  dynamic  variables
                 during  session  initialization.  For  more  information, see
                 Domain Variables .

                 key -> (string)
                     The dynamic variable that has aliases.

                 value -> (map)
                     Map of aliases to the value to be used at request time.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

              DashConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The configuration for a DASH source.

                 ManifestEndpointPrefix -> (string)
                     The URL generated by MediaTailor to initiate  a  playback
                     session.  The  session  uses  server-side reporting. This
                     setting is ignored in PUT operations.

                 MpdLocation -> (string)
                     The setting that controls  whether  MediaTailor  includes
                     the Location tag in DASH manifests. MediaTailor populates
                     the  Location  tag  with  the  URL  for  manifest  update
                     requests, to be used by players that don't support sticky
                     redirects. Disable this if you have CDN routing rules set
                     up  for  accessing  MediaTailor  manifests,  and  you are
                     either using client-side reporting or your  players  sup-
                     port sticky HTTP redirects. Valid values are DISABLED and
                     EMT_DEFAULT. The EMT_DEFAULT setting enables  the  inclu-
                     sion of the tag and is the default value.

                 OriginManifestType -> (string)
                     The  setting  that  controls  whether MediaTailor handles
                     manifests from the origin server  as  multi-period  mani-
                     fests  or  single-period manifests. If your origin server
                     produces  single-period  manifests,  set  this  to   SIN-
                     GLE_PERIOD.  The  default  setting  is  MULTI_PERIOD. For
                     multi-period manifests, omit this setting or  set  it  to
                     MULTI_PERIOD.

              HlsConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The configuration for HLS content.

                 ManifestEndpointPrefix -> (string)
                     The  URL  that is used to initiate a playback session for
                     devices  that  support  Apple  HLS.  The   session   uses
                     server-side reporting.

              LivePreRollConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The configuration for pre-roll ad insertion.

                 AdDecisionServerUrl -> (string)
                     The  URL  for  the  ad decision server (ADS) for pre-roll
                     ads. This includes the specification of static parameters
                     and  placeholders  for  dynamic parameters. AWS Elemental
                     MediaTailor substitutes player-specific and  session-spe-
                     cific  parameters  as needed when calling the ADS. Alter-
                     nately, for testing, you can provide a static  VAST  URL.
                     The maximum length is 25,000 characters.

                 MaxDurationSeconds -> (integer)
                     The  maximum  allowed duration for the pre-roll ad avail.
                     AWS Elemental MediaTailor  won't  play  pre-roll  ads  to
                     exceed this duration, regardless of the total duration of
                     ads that the ADS returns.

              LogConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The Amazon CloudWatch log settings for a playback  configura-
                 tion.

                 PercentEnabled -> (integer)
                     The  percentage of session logs that MediaTailor sends to
                     your Cloudwatch Logs account. For example, if your  play-
                     back  configuration  has 1000 sessions and percentEnabled
                     is set to 60, MediaTailor sends logs for 600 of the  ses-
                     sions  to  CloudWatch Logs. MediaTailor decides at random
                     which of the playback configuration sessions to send logs
                     for. If you want to view logs for a specific session, you
                     can use the debug log mode .

                     Valid values: 0 - 100

              ManifestProcessingRules -> (structure)
                 The configuration for  manifest  processing  rules.  Manifest
                 processing  rules  enable  customization  of the personalized
                 manifests created by MediaTailor.

                 AdMarkerPassthrough -> (structure)
                     For HLS, when set to  true,  MediaTailor  passes  through
                     EXT-X-CUE-IN, EXT-X-CUE-OUT, and EXT-X-SPLICEPOINT-SCTE35
                     ad markers from the origin manifest  to  the  MediaTailor
                     personalized manifest.

                     No  logic is applied to these ad markers. For example, if
                     EXT-X-CUE-OUT has a value of 60, but no  ads  are  filled
                     for  that ad break, MediaTailor will not set the value to
                     0.

                     Enabled -> (boolean)
                        Enables ad marker passthrough for your  configuration.

              Name -> (string)
                 The identifier for the playback configuration.

              PersonalizationThresholdSeconds -> (integer)
                 Defines  the maximum duration of underfilled ad time (in sec-
                 onds) allowed in an ad break. If the duration of  underfilled
                 ad  time exceeds the personalization threshold, then the per-
                 sonalization of the ad break is abandoned and the  underlying
                 content  is  shown. This feature applies to ad replacement in
                 live and VOD streams, rather than ad  insertion,  because  it
                 relies  on an underlying content stream. For more information
                 about ad break behavior, including ad replacement and  inser-
                 tion, see Ad Behavior in AWS Elemental MediaTailor .

              PlaybackConfigurationArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) for the playback configura-
                 tion.

              PlaybackEndpointPrefix -> (string)
                 The URL that the player accesses to get a manifest  from  AWS
                 Elemental MediaTailor.

              SessionInitializationEndpointPrefix -> (string)
                 The  URL  that  the  player uses to initialize a session that
                 uses client-side reporting.

              SlateAdUrl -> (string)
                 The URL for a video asset to transcode and  use  to  fill  in
                 time  that's not used by ads. AWS Elemental MediaTailor shows
                 the slate to fill in gaps in media content.  Configuring  the
                 slate  is optional for non-VPAID playback configurations. For
                 VPAID, the slate is required because MediaTailor provides  it
                 in  the  slots  designated  for dynamic ad content. The slate
                 must be a high-quality asset that  contains  both  audio  and
                 video.

              Tags -> (map)
                 The tags to assign to the playback configuration.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              TranscodeProfileName -> (string)
                 The  name  that is used to associate this playback configura-
                 tion with a custom  transcode  profile.  This  overrides  the
                 dynamic transcoding defaults of MediaTailor. Use this only if
                 you have already set up custom profiles with the help of  AWS
                 Support.

              VideoContentSourceUrl -> (string)
                 The  URL prefix for the parent manifest for the stream, minus
                 the asset ID. The maximum length is 512 characters.

       NextToken -> (string)
          Pagination token returned by  the  GET  list  request  when  results
          exceed  the maximum allowed. Use the token to fetch the next page of
          results.
