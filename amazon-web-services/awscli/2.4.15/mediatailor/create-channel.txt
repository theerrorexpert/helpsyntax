            create-channel
          --channel-name <value>
          [--filler-slate <value>]
          --outputs <value>

OPTIONS
       --channel-name (string)
          The identifier for the channel you are working on.

       --filler-slate (structure)
          The  slate  used  to fill gaps between programs in the schedule. You
          must configure filler slate if your channel uses  the  LINEAR  Play-
          backMode.  MediaTailor  doesn't  support  filler  slate for channels
          using the LOOP PlaybackMode.

          SourceLocationName -> (string)
              The name of the source location where the slate  VOD  source  is
              stored.

          VodSourceName -> (string)
              The  slate VOD source name. The VOD source must already exist in
              a source location before it can be used for slate.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SourceLocationName=string,VodSourceName=string

          }

       --outputs (list)
          The channel's output properties.

          (structure)

                 DASH manifest configuration parameters.

                 ManifestWindowSeconds -> (integer)

                 MinBufferTimeSeconds -> (integer)
                     Minimum  amount  of  content (measured in seconds) that a

                 MinUpdatePeriodSeconds -> (integer)
                     Minimum  amount  of  time  (in  seconds)  that the player
                     should wait before requesting updates  to  the  manifest.

                 SuggestedPresentationDelaySeconds -> (integer)
                     Amount  of  time  (in  seconds) that the player should be

            ...
          ]

       --playback-mode (string)
          The type of playback mode to use for this channel.

          LINEAR - The programs in the schedule play once back-to-back in  the
          schedule.

          LOOP  - The programs in the schedule play back-to-back in an endless
          loop. When the last program in the schedule stops playing,  playback
          loops back to the first program in the schedule.

          Possible values:

          o LOOP

          o LINEAR

       --tags (map)
          The tags to assign to the channel.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
