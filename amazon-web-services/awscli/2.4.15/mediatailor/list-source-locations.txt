LIST-SOURCE-LOCATIONS()                                LIST-SOURCE-LOCATIONS()



NAME
       list-source-locations -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a list of source locations.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-source-locations  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Items

SYNOPSIS
            list-source-locations
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Items -> (list)
          An array of source locations.

          (structure)
              This response includes only the "type" : "object" property.

              AccessConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The access configuration for the source location.

                 AccessType -> (string)
                     The  type  of  authentication used to access content from
                     HttpConfiguration::BaseUrl  on  your   source   location.
                     Accepted value: S3_SIGV4.

                     S3_SIGV4  -  AWS  Signature  Version 4 authentication for
                     Amazon S3 hosted virtual-style  access.  If  your  source
                     location base URL is an Amazon S3 bucket, MediaTailor can
                     use AWS Signature Version  4  (SigV4)  authentication  to
                     access  the  bucket  where your source content is stored.
                     Your MediaTailor source location baseURL must follow  the
                     S3  virtual hosted-style request URL format. For example,
                     https://bucket-name.s3.Region.amazonaws.com/key-name.

                     Before you can use S3_SIGV4, you must meet these require-
                     ments:

                     o You  must allow MediaTailor to access your S3 bucket by
                       granting mediatailor.amazonaws.com principal access  in
                       IAM.  For  information about configuring access in IAM,
                       see Access management in the IAM User Guide.

                     o The mediatailor.amazonaws.com  service  principal  must
                       have permissions to read all top level manifests refer-
                       enced by the VodSource packaging configurations.

                     o The caller of the API must have s3:GetObject  IAM  per-
                       missions  to read all top level manifests referenced by
                       your MediaTailor VodSource packaging configurations.

                     SecretStringKey -> (string)
                        The  AWS  Secrets  Manager SecretString key associated
                        with the access token. MediaTailor  uses  the  key  to
                        look up SecretString key and value pair containing the
                        access token.
