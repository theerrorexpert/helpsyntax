OPTIONS
       --ad-decision-server-url (string)
          The URL for the ad decision server (ADS). This includes the specifi-
          cation of static parameters and placeholders for dynamic parameters.
          AWS  Elemental  MediaTailor  substitutes  player-specific  and  ses-
          sion-specific parameters as needed  when  calling  the  ADS.  Alter-
          nately,  for  testing you can provide a static VAST URL. The maximum
          length is 25,000 characters.

       --avail-suppression (structure)
          The configuration for avail suppression, also known as  ad  suppres-
          sion.  For more information about ad suppression, see Ad Suppression
          .

          Mode -> (string)
              Sets the ad suppression mode. By default, ad suppression is  off
              and all ad breaks are filled with ads or slate. When Mode is set
              to BEHIND_LIVE_EDGE, ad suppression is  active  and  MediaTailor
              won't  fill ad breaks on or behind the ad suppression Value time
              in the manifest lookback window.

          Value -> (string)
              A live edge offset time in HH:MM:SS. MediaTailor won't  fill  ad
              breaks  on  or behind this time in the manifest lookback window.
              If Value is set to 00:00:00, it is in sync with the  live  edge,
              and  MediaTailor  won't fill any ad breaks on or behind the live
              edge. If you set a Value time, MediaTailor  won't  fill  any  ad
              breaks  on  or behind this time in the manifest lookback window.
              For example, if you set 00:45:00, then MediaTailor will fill  ad
              breaks  that  occur  within 45 minutes behind the live edge, but
              won't fill ad breaks on or behind 45  minutes  behind  the  live
              edge.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Mode=string,Value=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Mode": "OFF"|"BEHIND_LIVE_EDGE",
            "Value": "string"
          }

       --bumper (structure)
          The  configuration  for  bumpers.  Bumpers  are short audio or video
          clips that play at the start or before the end of an  ad  break.  To
          learn more about bumpers, see Bumpers .

          EndUrl -> (string)
              The URL for the end bumper asset.

          StartUrl -> (string)
              The URL for the start bumper asset.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          EndUrl=string,StartUrl=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "EndUrl": "string",
            "StartUrl": "string"
          }

       --cdn-configuration (structure)
          The  configuration  for using a content delivery network (CDN), like
          Amazon CloudFront, for content and ad segment management.

          AdSegmentUrlPrefix -> (string)
              A non-default content delivery network (CDN) to  serve  ad  seg-
              ments.  By default, AWS Elemental MediaTailor uses Amazon Cloud-
              Front with default cache settings as its CDN for ad segments. To
              set  up an alternate CDN, create a rule in your CDN for the ori-
              gin ads.mediatailor.&lt;region>.amazonaws.com. Then specify  the
              rule's name in this AdSegmentUrlPrefix. When AWS Elemental Medi-
              aTailor serves a manifest, it reports your CDN as the source for
              ad segments.

          ContentSegmentUrlPrefix -> (string)
              A  content  delivery network (CDN) to cache content segments, so
              that content requests dont always  have  to  go  to  the  origin
              server. First, create a rule in your CDN for the content segment
              origin server. Then specify the rule's name in this  ContentSeg-
              mentUrlPrefix. When AWS Elemental MediaTailor serves a manifest,
              it reports your CDN as the source for content segments.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AdSegmentUrlPrefix=string,ContentSegmentUrlPrefix=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AdSegmentUrlPrefix": "string",
            "ContentSegmentUrlPrefix": "string"
          }

       --configuration-aliases (map)
          The player parameters and aliases used as dynamic  variables  during
          session initialization. For more information, see Domain Variables .
              key -> (string)
                 The dynamic variable that has aliases.

          value -> (map)
              Map of aliases to the value to be used at request time.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string,KeyName2=KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": {"string": "string"
                ...}
            ...}

       --dash-configuration (structure)
          The configuration for DASH content.

          MpdLocation -> (string)
              The setting that controls whether MediaTailor includes the Loca-
              tion  tag  in DASH manifests. MediaTailor populates the Location
              tag with the URL for manifest update requests,  to  be  used  by
              players that don't support sticky redirects. Disable this if you
              have CDN routing rules set up for  accessing  MediaTailor  mani-
              fests,  and  you  are either using client-side reporting or your
              players support sticky HTTP redirects. Valid values are DISABLED
              and  EMT_DEFAULT.  The EMT_DEFAULT setting enables the inclusion
              of the tag and is the default value.

          OriginManifestType -> (string)
              The setting that controls whether MediaTailor handles  manifests
              from  the  origin  server  as  multi-period  manifests  or  sin-
              gle-period  manifests.  If  your  origin  server  produces  sin-
              gle-period  manifests,  set  this  to SINGLE_PERIOD. The default
              setting is MULTI_PERIOD. For multi-period manifests,  omit  this
              setting or set it to MULTI_PERIOD.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MpdLocation=string,OriginManifestType=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MpdLocation": "string",
            "OriginManifestType": "SINGLE_PERIOD"|"MULTI_PERIOD"
          }

       --live-pre-roll-configuration (structure)
          The configuration for pre-roll ad insertion.

          AdDecisionServerUrl -> (string)
              The  URL for the ad decision server (ADS) for pre-roll ads. This
              includes the specification of static parameters and placeholders
              for  dynamic  parameters.  AWS Elemental MediaTailor substitutes
              player-specific and session-specific parameters as  needed  when
              calling  the  ADS.  Alternately,  for testing, you can provide a
              static VAST URL. The maximum length is 25,000 characters.

          MaxDurationSeconds -> (integer)
              The maximum allowed duration for the pre-roll ad avail. AWS Ele-
              mental  MediaTailor won't play pre-roll ads to exceed this dura-
              tion, regardless of the total  duration  of  ads  that  the  ADS
              returns.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AdDecisionServerUrl=string,MaxDurationSeconds=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AdDecisionServerUrl": "string",
            "MaxDurationSeconds": integer
          }

       --manifest-processing-rules (structure)
          The configuration for manifest processing rules. Manifest processing
          rules enable customization of the personalized manifests created  by
          MediaTailor.

          AdMarkerPassthrough -> (structure)
              For   HLS,   when   set  to  true,  MediaTailor  passes  through
              EXT-X-CUE-IN,  EXT-X-CUE-OUT,  and  EXT-X-SPLICEPOINT-SCTE35  ad
              markers from the origin manifest to the MediaTailor personalized
              manifest.

              No logic is  applied  to  these  ad  markers.  For  example,  if
              EXT-X-CUE-OUT  has a value of 60, but no ads are filled for that
              ad break, MediaTailor will not set the value to 0.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Enables ad marker passthrough for your configuration.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AdMarkerPassthrough={Enabled=boolean}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AdMarkerPassthrough": {
              "Enabled": true|false
            }
          }

       --name (string)
          The identifier for the playback configuration.

       --personalization-threshold-seconds (integer)
          Defines the maximum duration of underfilled  ad  time  (in  seconds)
          allowed  in  an  ad  break.  If  the duration of underfilled ad time
          exceeds the personalization threshold, then the  personalization  of
          the  ad break is abandoned and the underlying content is shown. This
          feature applies to ad replacement in live and  VOD  streams,  rather
          than  ad  insertion,  because  it  relies  on  an underlying content
          stream. For more information about ad break behavior,  including  ad
          replacement  and  insertion,  see Ad Behavior in AWS Elemental Medi-
          aTailor .

       --slate-ad-url (string)
          The URL for a high-quality video asset to transcode and use to  fill
          in  time that's not used by ads. AWS Elemental MediaTailor shows the
          slate to fill in gaps in media content.  Configuring  the  slate  is
          optional  for  non-VPAID  configurations.  For  VPAID,  the slate is
          required because MediaTailor provides it in the slots that are  des-
          ignated  for  dynamic  ad  content. The slate must be a high-quality
          asset that contains both audio and video.

       --tags (map)
          The tags to assign to the playback configuration.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --transcode-profile-name (string)
          The name that is used to associate this playback configuration  with
          a  custom  transcode profile. This overrides the dynamic transcoding
          defaults of MediaTailor. Use this only if you have  already  set  up
          custom profiles with the help of AWS Support.

       --video-content-source-url (string)
          The  URL  prefix  for  the parent manifest for the stream, minus the
          asset ID. The maximum length is 512 characters.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AdDecisionServerUrl -> (string)
          The URL for the ad decision server (ADS). This includes the specifi-
          cation of static parameters and placeholders for dynamic parameters.
          AWS  Elemental  MediaTailor  substitutes  player-specific  and  ses-
          sion-specific  parameters  as  needed  when  calling the ADS. Alter-
          nately, for testing, you can provide a static VAST URL. The  maximum
          length is 25,000 characters.

       AvailSuppression -> (structure)
          The  configuration  for avail suppression, also known as ad suppres-
          sion. For more information about ad suppression, see Ad  Suppression
          .

          Mode -> (string)
              Sets  the ad suppression mode. By default, ad suppression is off
              and all ad breaks are filled with ads or slate. When Mode is set
              to  BEHIND_LIVE_EDGE,  ad  suppression is active and MediaTailor
              won't fill ad breaks on or behind the ad suppression Value  time
              in the manifest lookback window.

          Value -> (string)
              A  live  edge offset time in HH:MM:SS. MediaTailor won't fill ad
              breaks on or behind this time in the manifest  lookback  window.
              If  Value  is set to 00:00:00, it is in sync with the live edge,
              and MediaTailor won't fill any ad breaks on or behind  the  live
              edge.  If  you  set  a Value time, MediaTailor won't fill any ad
              breaks on or behind this time in the manifest  lookback  window.
              For  example, if you set 00:45:00, then MediaTailor will fill ad
              breaks that occur within 45 minutes behind the  live  edge,  but
              won't  fill  ad  breaks  on or behind 45 minutes behind the live
              edge.

       Bumper -> (structure)
          The configuration for bumpers. Bumpers  are  short  audio  or  video
          clips  that  play  at the start or before the end of an ad break. To
          learn more about bumpers, see Bumpers .

          EndUrl -> (string)
              The URL for the end bumper asset.

          StartUrl -> (string)
              The URL for the start bumper asset.

       CdnConfiguration -> (structure)
          The configuration for using a content delivery network  (CDN),  like
          Amazon CloudFront, for content and ad segment management.

          AdSegmentUrlPrefix -> (string)
              A  non-default  content  delivery network (CDN) to serve ad seg-
              ments. By default, AWS Elemental MediaTailor uses Amazon  Cloud-
              Front with default cache settings as its CDN for ad segments. To
              set up an alternate CDN, create a rule in your CDN for the  ori-
              gin  ads.mediatailor.&lt;region>.amazonaws.com. Then specify the
              rule's name in this AdSegmentUrlPrefix. When AWS Elemental Medi-
              aTailor serves a manifest, it reports your CDN as the source for
              ad segments.

          ContentSegmentUrlPrefix -> (string)
              A content delivery network (CDN) to cache content  segments,  so
              that  content  requests  dont  always  have  to go to the origin
              server. First, create a rule in your CDN for the content segment
              origin  server. Then specify the rule's name in this ContentSeg-
              mentUrlPrefix. When AWS Elemental MediaTailor serves a manifest,
              it reports your CDN as the source for content segments.

       ConfigurationAliases -> (map)

              Map of aliases to the value to be used at request time.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

       DashConfiguration -> (structure)
          The configuration for DASH content.

          ManifestEndpointPrefix -> (string)
              The URL generated by MediaTailor to initiate a playback session.
              The session uses server-side reporting. This setting is  ignored
              in PUT operations.

          MpdLocation -> (string)
              The setting that controls whether MediaTailor includes the Loca-
              tion tag in DASH manifests. MediaTailor populates  the  Location
              tag  with  the  URL  for manifest update requests, to be used by
              players that don't support sticky redirects. Disable this if you
              have  CDN  routing  rules set up for accessing MediaTailor mani-
              fests, and you are either using client-side  reporting  or  your
              players support sticky HTTP redirects. Valid values are DISABLED
              and EMT_DEFAULT. The EMT_DEFAULT setting enables  the  inclusion
              of the tag and is the default value.

          OriginManifestType -> (string)
              The  setting that controls whether MediaTailor handles manifests
              from  the  origin  server  as  multi-period  manifests  or  sin-
              gle-period  manifests.  If  your  origin  server  produces  sin-
              gle-period manifests, set this  to  SINGLE_PERIOD.  The  default
              setting  is  MULTI_PERIOD. For multi-period manifests, omit this
              setting or set it to MULTI_PERIOD.

       HlsConfiguration -> (structure)
          The configuration for HLS content.

          ManifestEndpointPrefix -> (string)
              The URL that is used to initiate a playback session for  devices
              that  support Apple HLS. The session uses server-side reporting.

       LivePreRollConfiguration -> (structure)
          The configuration for pre-roll ad insertion.

          AdDecisionServerUrl -> (string)
              The URL for the ad decision server (ADS) for pre-roll ads.  This
              includes the specification of static parameters and placeholders
              for dynamic parameters. AWS  Elemental  MediaTailor  substitutes
              player-specific  and  session-specific parameters as needed when
              calling the ADS. Alternately, for testing,  you  can  provide  a
              static VAST URL. The maximum length is 25,000 characters.

          MaxDurationSeconds -> (integer)
              The maximum allowed duration for the pre-roll ad avail. AWS Ele-
              mental MediaTailor won't play pre-roll ads to exceed this  dura-
              tion,  regardless  of  the  total  duration  of ads that the ADS
              returns.

       LogConfiguration -> (structure)
          The Amazon CloudWatch log settings for a playback configuration.

          PercentEnabled -> (integer)
              The percentage of session logs that MediaTailor  sends  to  your
              Cloudwatch  Logs account. For example, if your playback configu-
              ration has 1000 sessions and percentEnabled is set to 60,  Medi-
              aTailor  sends  logs for 600 of the sessions to CloudWatch Logs.
              MediaTailor decides at random which of the  playback  configura-
              tion  sessions  to send logs for. If you want to view logs for a
              specific session, you can use the debug log mode .

              Valid values: 0 - 100

       ManifestProcessingRules -> (structure)
          The configuration for manifest processing rules. Manifest processing
          rules  enable customization of the personalized manifests created by
          MediaTailor.

          AdMarkerPassthrough -> (structure)
              For  HLS,  when  set  to  true,   MediaTailor   passes   through
              EXT-X-CUE-IN,  EXT-X-CUE-OUT,  and  EXT-X-SPLICEPOINT-SCTE35  ad
              markers from the origin manifest to the MediaTailor personalized
              manifest.

              No  logic  is  applied  to  these  ad  markers.  For example, if
              EXT-X-CUE-OUT has a value of 60, but no ads are filled for  that
              ad break, MediaTailor will not set the value to 0.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Enables ad marker passthrough for your configuration.

       Name -> (string)
          The identifier for the playback configuration.

       PersonalizationThresholdSeconds -> (integer)
          Defines  the  maximum  duration  of underfilled ad time (in seconds)
          allowed in an ad break. If  the  duration  of  underfilled  ad  time
          exceeds  the  personalization threshold, then the personalization of
          the ad break is abandoned and the underlying content is shown.  This
          feature  applies  to  ad replacement in live and VOD streams, rather
          than ad insertion,  because  it  relies  on  an  underlying  content
          stream.  For  more information about ad break behavior, including ad
          replacement and insertion, see Ad Behavior in  AWS  Elemental  Medi-
          aTailor .

       PlaybackConfigurationArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the playback configuration.

       PlaybackEndpointPrefix -> (string)
          The  URL that the player accesses to get a manifest from AWS Elemen-
          tal MediaTailor. This session will use server-side reporting.

       SessionInitializationEndpointPrefix -> (string)
          The URL that the player uses  to  initialize  a  session  that  uses
          client-side reporting.

       SlateAdUrl -> (string)
          The  URL for a high-quality video asset to transcode and use to fill
          in time that's not used by ads. AWS Elemental MediaTailor shows  the
          slate  to  fill  in  gaps in media content. Configuring the slate is
          optional for non-VPAID playback configurations. For VPAID, the slate
          is  required because MediaTailor provides it in the slots designated
          for dynamic ad content. The slate must be a high-quality asset  that
          contains both audio and video.

       Tags -> (map)
          The tags assigned to the playback configuration.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       TranscodeProfileName -> (string)
          The  name that is used to associate this playback configuration with
          a custom transcode profile. This overrides the  dynamic  transcoding
          defaults  of  MediaTailor.  Use this only if you have already set up
          custom profiles with the help of AWS Support.

       VideoContentSourceUrl -> (string)
          The URL prefix for the parent manifest for  the  stream,  minus  the
          asset ID. The maximum length is 512 characters.
