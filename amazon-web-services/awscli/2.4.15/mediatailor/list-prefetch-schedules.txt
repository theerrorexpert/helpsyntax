LIST-PREFETCH-SCHEDULES()                            LIST-PREFETCH-SCHEDULES()



NAME
       list-prefetch-schedules -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new prefetch schedule.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-prefetch-schedules  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: Items

SYNOPSIS
            list-prefetch-schedules
          --playback-configuration-name <value>
          [--stream-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --playback-configuration-name (string)
          The name of the playback configuration.

       --stream-id (string)
          An optional filtering  parameter  whereby  MediaTailor  filters  the
          prefetch schedules to include only specific streams.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Items -> (list)
          Lists the prefetch schedules. An empty Items list doesn't mean there
          aren't more items to fetch, just that that page was empty.

          (structure)
              A complex type that contains prefetch schedule information.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the prefetch schedule.

              Consumption -> (structure)
                 Consumption  settings  determine  how,  and when, MediaTailor
                 places the prefetched ads  into  ad  breaks.  Ad  consumption
                 occurs  within  a span of time that you define, called a con-
                 sumption window . You can  designate  which  ad  breaks  that
                 MediaTailor fills with prefetch ads by setting avail matching
                 criteria.

                 AvailMatchingCriteria -> (list)
                     If you only want MediaTailor  to  insert  prefetched  ads
                     into avails (ad breaks) that match specific dynamic vari-
                     ables, such as scte.event_id, set the avail matching cri-
                     teria.

                     (structure)
                        MediaTailor  only  places (consumes) prefetched ads if
                        the ad break meets the criteria defined by the dynamic
                        variables.  This gives you granular control over which
                        ad break to place the prefetched ads into.

                        As an example, let's say that you set  DynamicVariable
                        to  scte.event_id  and  Operator  to  EQUALS, and your
                        playback   configuration   has   an   ADS    URL    of
                        https://my.ads.server.com/path?&podId=[scte.avail_num]&event=[scte.event_id]&duration=[session.avail_duration_secs].
                        And the prefetch request to  the  ADS  contains  these
                        values
                        https://my.ads.server.com/path?&podId=3&event=my-awesome-event&duration=30.
                        MediaTailor  will  only insert the prefetched ads into
                        the ad break if has a SCTE marker with an event id  of
                        my-awesome-event,  since  it  must  match the event id
                        that MediaTailor uses to query the ADS.

                        You can specify up to five  AvailMatchingCriteria.  If
                        you  specify multiple AvailMatchingCriteria, MediaTai-
                        lor combines them to match using a  logical  AND.  You
                        can model logical OR combinations by creating multiple
                        prefetch schedules.

                        DynamicVariable -> (string)
                            The dynamic variable(s)  that  MediaTailor  should
                            use  as  avail matching criteria. MediaTailor only
                            places the prefetched ads into the  avail  if  the
                            avail  matches the criteria defined by the dynamic
                            variable. For information about dynamic variables,
                            see  Using dynamic ad variables in the MediaTailor
                            User Guide .

                            You can include up to 100 dynamic variables.

                        Operator -> (string)
                            For the DynamicVariable specified  in  AvailMatch-
                            ingCriteria,  the  Operator  that  is used for the
                            comparison.

                 EndTime -> (timestamp)
                     The  time  when  MediaTailor  no  longer  considers   the
                     prefetched  ads for use in an ad break. MediaTailor auto-
                     matically deletes prefetch schedules no less  than  seven
                     days after the end time. If you'd like to manually delete
                     the prefetch schedule, you can call  DeletePrefetchSched-
                     ule.

                 StartTime -> (timestamp)
                     The time when prefetched ads are considered for use in an
                     ad break. If you don't specify StartTime, the  prefetched
                     ads  are  available  after MediaTailor retrives them from
                     the ad decision server.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the prefetch schedule. The name  must  be  unique
                 among  all  prefetch  schedules  that are associated with the
                 specified playback configuration.

              PlaybackConfigurationName -> (string)
                 The name of the playback configuration to create the prefetch
                 schedule for.

              Retrieval -> (structure)
                 A  complex type that contains settings for prefetch retrieval
                 from the ad decision server (ADS).

                 DynamicVariables -> (map)
                     The dynamic variables  to  use  for  substitution  during
                     prefetch requests to the ad decision server (ADS).

                     You  intially configure dynamic variables for the ADS URL
                     when you set up your  playback  configuration.  When  you
                     specify  DynamicVariables  for  prefetch retrieval, Medi-
                     aTailor includes the dynamic variables in the request  to
                     the ADS.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 EndTime -> (timestamp)
                     The  time  when prefetch retrieval ends for the ad break.
                     Prefetching will be attempted for manifest requests  that
                     occur at or before this time.

                 StartTime -> (timestamp)
                     The  time  when  prefetch  retrievals  can start for this
                     break. Ad prefetching  will  be  attempted  for  manifest
                     requests  that  occur  at or after this time. Defaults to
                     the  current  time.  If  not  specified,   the   prefetch
                     retrieval starts as soon as possible.

              StreamId -> (string)
                 An  optional  stream identifier that you can specify in order
                 to prefetch for multiple streams that use the  same  playback
                 configuration.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  value  that you will use forNextToken in the next ListPrefetch-
          SchedulesRequest request.
