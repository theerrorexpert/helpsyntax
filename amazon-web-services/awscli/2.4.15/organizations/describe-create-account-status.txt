NAME
       describe-create-account-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  current  status of an asynchronous request to create an
       account.

       This operation can be called only from  the  organization's  management
       account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an
       AWS service.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-create-account-status
          --create-account-request-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --create-account-request-id (string)
          Specifies the Id value that uniquely  identifies  the  CreateAccount
          request.  You  can  get  the  value  from the CreateAccountStatus.Id
          response in an earlier  CreateAccount request, or from the  ListCre-
          ateAccountStatus operation.

          The  regex  pattern  for a create account request ID string requires
          "car-" followed by from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the latest status about a request to create an account

       The following example shows how to request the latest status for a pre-
       vious  request  to  create an account in an organization. The specified
       --request-id comes from the response  of  the  original  call  to  cre-
       ate-account.  The  account  creation  request shows by the status field
       that Organizations successfully completed the creation of the  account.

       Command:

          aws organizations describe-create-account-status --create-account-request-id car-examplecreateaccountrequestid111

       Output:

          {
            "CreateAccountStatus": {
              "State": "SUCCEEDED",
              "AccountId": "555555555555",
              "AccountName": "Beta account",
              "RequestedTimestamp": 1470684478.687,
              "CompletedTimestamp": 1470684532.472,
              "Id": "car-examplecreateaccountrequestid111"
            }
          }

          request.

          Id -> (string)
              The unique identifier (ID) that references this request. You get
              this  value  from  the  response  of  the initial  CreateAccount
              request to create the account.

              The regex  pattern  for  a  create  account  request  ID  string
              requires  "car-"  followed  by from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or
              digits.

              The date and time that the request was made for the account cre-
              ation.

          CompletedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the account was created and  the  request

                already includes an account with that email address.

              o IDENTITY_INVALID_BUSINESS_VALIDATION:  The  AWS  account  that
