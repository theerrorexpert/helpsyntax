LIST-DELEGATED-ADMINISTRATORS()                LIST-DELEGATED-ADMINISTRATORS()



NAME
       list-delegated-administrators -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the AWS accounts that are designated as delegated administrators
       in this organization.

       This operation can be called only from  the  organization's  management
       account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an
       AWS service.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-delegated-administrators is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: DelegatedAdministrators

SYNOPSIS
            list-delegated-administrators
          [--service-principal <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --service-principal (string)
          Specifies a service principal name. If specified, then the operation
          lists the delegated administrators only for the specified service.

          If you don't specify a service principal, the  operation  lists  all
          delegated administrators for all services in your organization.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DelegatedAdministrators -> (list)
          The list of delegated administrators in your organization.

          (structure)
              Contains information about the delegated administrator.

              Id -> (string)
                 The unique identifier (ID) of the  delegated  administrator's

              Arn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the delegated administra-
                 tor's account.

              Email -> (string)
                 The email address  that  is  associated  with  the  delegated
                 administrator's AWS account.

              Name -> (string)
                 The friendly name of the delegated administrator's account.

              Status -> (string)
                 The  status  of  the delegated administrator's account in the
                 organization.

              JoinedMethod -> (string)
                 The method by which  the  delegated  administrator's  account
                 joined the organization.

              JoinedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The  date when the delegated administrator's account became a
                 part of the organization.

              DelegationEnabledDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date when the account was made a delegated administrator.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If present, indicates that more output is available than is included
          in the current response. Use this value  in  the  NextToken  request
          parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to get the next part
          of the output. You should repeat this until the  NextToken  response
          element comes back as null .
