LIST-AWS-SERVICE-ACCESS-FOR-ORGANIZALIST-AWS-SERVICE-ACCESS-FOR-ORGANIZATION()



NAME
       list-aws-service-access-for-organization -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of the AWS services that you enabled to integrate with
       your organization. After a service on this list creates  the  resources
       that it requires for the integration, it can perform operations on your
       organization and its accounts.

       For more information about integrating other services with AWS  Organi-
       zations,  including the list of services that currently work with Orga-
       nizations, see Integrating AWS Organizations with Other AWS Services in
       the AWS Organizations User Guide.

       This  operation  can  be called only from the organization's management
       account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an
       AWS service.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-aws-service-access-for-organization is a paginated operation. Mul-
       tiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data  set
       of  results.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: EnabledServicePrincipals

SYNOPSIS
            list-aws-service-access-for-organization
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EnabledServicePrincipals -> (list)
          A  list  of the service principals for the services that are enabled
          to integrate with your organization. Each principal is  a  structure
          that includes the name and the date that it was enabled for integra-
          tion with AWS Organizations.

          (structure)
              A structure that contains details of a  service  principal  that
              represents  an AWS service that is enabled to integrate with AWS
              Organizations.

              ServicePrincipal -> (string)
                 The name of the service principal. This is typically  in  the
                 form of a URL, such as: `` servicename .amazonaws.com`` .

              DateEnabled -> (timestamp)
                 The  date that the service principal was enabled for integra-
                 tion with AWS Organizations.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If present, indicates that more output is available than is included
          in  the  current  response.  Use this value in the NextToken request
          parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to get the next part
          of  the  output. You should repeat this until the NextToken response
          element comes back as null .
