DESCRIBE-POLICY()                                            DESCRIBE-POLICY()



NAME
       describe-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information about a policy.

       This  operation  can  be called only from the organization's management
       account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an
       AWS service.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-policy
          --policy-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --policy-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier  (ID)  of  the  policy that you want details
          about. You can get the ID from the  ListPolicies  or   ListPolicies-
          ForTarget operations.

          The  regex  pattern for a policy ID string requires "p-" followed by
          from 8 to 128 lowercase or uppercase letters, digits, or the  under-
          score character (_).

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about a policy

       The following example shows how to request information about a policy:

          aws organizations describe-policy --policy-id p-examplepolicyid111

       The  output  includes  a  policy object that contains details about the
       policy:

          {
                  "Policy": {
                          "Content": "{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Action\": \"*\",\n      \"Resource\": \"*\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
                          "PolicySummary": {
                                  "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::111111111111:policy/o-exampleorgid/service_control_policy/p-examplepolicyid111",
                                  "Type": "SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY",
                                  "Id": "p-examplepolicyid111",
                                  "AwsManaged": false,
                                  "Name": "AllowAllS3Actions",
                                  "Description": "Enables admins to delegate S3 permissions"
                          }
                  }
          }

OUTPUT
       Policy -> (structure)
          A structure that contains details about the specified policy.

          PolicySummary -> (structure)
              A structure that contains additional details about the policy.

              Id -> (string)
                 The unique identifier (ID) of the policy.

                 The regex pattern for a policy ID string requires  "p-"  fol-
                 lowed  by  from 8 to 128 lowercase or uppercase letters, dig-
                 its, or the underscore character (_).

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy.

                 For more information about ARNs  in  Organizations,  see  ARN
                 Formats  Supported by Organizations in the AWS Service Autho-
                 rization Reference .

              Name -> (string)
                 The friendly name of the policy.

                 The regex pattern that is used to validate this parameter  is
                 a  string  of  any  of  the characters in the ASCII character
                 range.

              Description -> (string)

              AwsManaged -> (boolean)
                 A boolean value that indicates whether the  specified  policy
                 is  an  AWS  managed policy. If true, then you can attach the
                 policy to roots, OUs, or accounts, but you cannot edit it.

          Content -> (string)
              The text content of the policy.
