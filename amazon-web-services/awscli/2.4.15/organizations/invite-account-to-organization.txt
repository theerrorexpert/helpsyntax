NAME
       invite-account-to-organization -

DESCRIPTION
       Sends  an  invitation to another account to join your organization as a
       member account. AWS Organizations sends email on  your  behalf  to  the
       email  address  that  is associated with the other account's owner. The
       invitation is implemented as a  Handshake  whose  details  are  in  the
       response.

       WARNING:

          o You  can invite AWS accounts only from the same seller as the man-
            agement account. For example, if  your  organization's  management
            account  was created by Amazon Internet Services Pvt. Ltd (AISPL),
            an AWS seller in India, you can invite only other  AISPL  accounts
            to  your  organization.  You can't combine accounts from AISPL and
            AWS or from any  other  AWS  seller.  For  more  information,  see
            Consolidated Billing in India .

          o If  you receive an exception that indicates that you exceeded your
            account limits for the organization or that the  operation  failed
            because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and
            then try again. If the error persists after an hour,  contact  AWS
            Support .

       If  the request includes tags, then the requester must have the organi-
       zations:TagResource permission.

       This operation can be called only from  the  organization's  management
       account.

SYNOPSIS
            invite-account-to-organization
          --target <value>
          [--notes <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --target (structure)
          The  identifier  (ID)  of the AWS account that you want to invite to
          join your organization. This is a JSON object that contains the fol-
          lowing elements:
              { "Type": "ACCOUNT", "Id": "<* **account id number** * >" }

          If you use the AWS CLI, you can submit this as a single string, sim-
          ilar to the following example:
              --target Id=123456789012,Type=ACCOUNT

          If you specify "Type": "ACCOUNT" , you must provide the AWS  account
          ID  number  as  the  Id  . If you specify "Type": "EMAIL" , you must
          specify the email address that is associated with the account.
              --target Id=diego@example.com,Type=EMAIL

          Id -> (string)
              The unique identifier (ID) for the party.

              The regex pattern for handshake ID string requires "h-" followed
              by from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.

          Type -> (string)
              The type of party.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Id=string,Type=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Id": "string",
            "Type": "ACCOUNT"|"ORGANIZATION"|"EMAIL"
          }

       --notes (string)
          Additional  information  that  you  want to include in the generated
          email to the recipient account owner.

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags that you want  to  attach  to  the  account  when  it
          becomes  a member of the organization. For each tag in the list, you
          must specify both a tag key and a value. You can set the value to an
          empty  string,  but  you can't set it to null . For more information
          about tagging, see Tagging AWS Organizations resources  in  the  AWS
          Organizations User Guide.

          WARNING:
              Any  tags  in  the  request  are checked for compliance with any
              applicable tag policies when the request is made. The request is
              rejected if the tags in the request don't match the requirements
              of the policy at that time. Tag policy compliance  is  *  not  *
              checked  again  when the invitation is accepted and the tags are
              actually attached to the account. That means  that  if  the  tag
              policy  changes  between the invitation and the acceptance, then
              that tags could potentially be non-compliant.

          NOTE:
              If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed  the  allowed
              number of tags for an account, then the entire request fails and
              invitations are not sent.

          (structure)
              A custom key-value pair associated with a resource  within  your
              organization.

              You  can  attach  tags  to  any  of  the  following organization
              resources.

              o AWS account

              o Organizational unit (OU)

              o Organization root

              o Policy

              Key -> (string)
                 The key identifier, or name, of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The string value that's associated with the key of  the  tag.
                 You  can  set  the value of a tag to an empty string, but you
                 can't set the value of a tag to null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To invite an account to join an organization

       The   following   example   shows   the   master   account   owned   by
       bill@example.com inviting the account owned by juan@example.com to join
       an organization:

          aws organizations invite-account-to-organization --target '{"Type": "EMAIL", "Id": "juan@example.com"}' --notes "This is a request for Juan's account to join Bill's organization."

       The output includes a handshake structure that shows what  is  sent  to
       the invited account:

OUTPUT
       Handshake -> (structure)
          A  structure  that contains details about the handshake that is cre-
          ated to support this invitation request.

          Id -> (string)
              The unique identifier  (ID)  of  a  handshake.  The  originating
              account creates the ID when it initiates the handshake.

              The regex pattern for handshake ID string requires "h-" followed
              by from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a handshake.

              For more information about ARNs in Organizations, see  ARN  For-
              mats Supported by Organizations in the AWS Service Authorization
              Reference .

          Parties -> (list)
              Information about the two accounts that are participating in the
              handshake.

              (structure)
                 Identifies a participant in a handshake.

                 Id -> (string)
                     The unique identifier (ID) for the party.

                     The  regex  pattern for handshake ID string requires "h-"
                     followed by from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The type of party.

          State -> (string)
              The current state of the handshake. Use the state to  trace  the
              flow  of  the handshake through the process from its creation to
              its acceptance. The meaning of each of the valid  values  is  as
              follows:

              o REQUESTED  :  This  handshake  was sent to multiple recipients
                (applicable to only some handshake types) and not all  recipi-
                ents have responded yet. The request stays in this state until
                all recipients respond.

              o OPEN : This handshake was sent to multiple recipients  (appli-
                cable  to  only  some  policy  types)  and all recipients have
                responded, allowing the originator to complete  the  handshake
                action.

              o CANCELED  :  This handshake is no longer active because it was
                canceled by the originating account.

              o ACCEPTED : This handshake is  complete  because  it  has  been
                accepted by the recipient.

              o DECLINED  :  This handshake is no longer active because it was
                declined by the recipient account.

              o EXPIRED : This handshake is no longer active because the orig-
                inator did not receive a response of any kind from the recipi-
                ent before the expiration time (15 days).

          RequestedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the handshake request was made.

          ExpirationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the handshake expires. If  the  recipient
              of  the  handshake request fails to respond before the specified
              date and time, the handshake becomes inactive and is  no  longer
              valid.

          Action -> (string)
              The  type  of  handshake, indicating what action occurs when the
              recipient accepts the handshake. The following  handshake  types
              are supported:

              o INVITE  :  This type of handshake represents a request to join
                an organization. It is always sent from the management account
                to only non-member accounts.

              o ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES  :  This  type  of  handshake represents a
                request to enable all  features  in  an  organization.  It  is
                always sent from the management account to only invited member
                accounts. Created accounts do not receive this  because  those
                accounts were created by the organization's management account
                and approval is inferred.

              o APPROVE_ALL_FEATURES : This type of handshake is sent from the
                Organizations  service  when all member accounts have approved
                the ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES invitation. It is  sent  only  to  the
                management account and signals the master that it can finalize
                the process to enable all features.

          Resources -> (list)
              Additional information that is needed to process the  handshake.

              (structure)
                 Contains  additional  data  that is needed to process a hand-
                 shake.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The information that is passed to the other party in  the
                     handshake.  The format of the value string must match the
                     requirements of the specified type.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The type of information being passed, specifying how  the
                     value is to be interpreted by the other party:

                     o ACCOUNT - Specifies an AWS account ID number.

                     o ORGANIZATION - Specifies an organization ID number.

                       with the account that receives the handshake.

                     o OWNER_EMAIL - Specifies the  email  address  associated
                       with  the  management  account. Included as information
                       about an organization.

                     o OWNER_NAME - Specifies the  name  associated  with  the
                       management  account.  Included  as information about an
                       organization.

                     o NOTES - Additional text provided by the handshake  ini-
                       tiator and intended for the recipient to read.

                 Resources -> (list)
                     When needed, contains an additional array of HandshakeRe-
                     source objects.

                     (structure)
                        Contains additional data that is needed to  process  a
                        handshake.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  information that is passed to the other party
                            in the handshake. The format of the  value  string
                            must match the requirements of the specified type.
