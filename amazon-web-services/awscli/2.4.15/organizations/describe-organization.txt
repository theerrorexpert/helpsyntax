DESCRIBE-ORGANIZATION()                                DESCRIBE-ORGANIZATION()



NAME
       describe-organization -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information  about  the organization that the user's account
       belongs to.

       This operation can be called from any account in the organization.

       NOTE:
          Even if a policy type is shown as available in the organization, you
          can  disable it separately at the root level with  DisablePolicyType
          . Use  ListRoots to see the status of policy types for  a  specified
          root.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-organization
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about the current organization

       The following example shows you how to request details about an organi-
       zation:

          aws organizations describe-organization

       The output includes an organization object that has the  details  about
       the organization:

          {
                  "Organization": {
                          "MasterAccountArn": "arn:aws:organizations::111111111111:account/o-exampleorgid/111111111111",
                          "MasterAccountEmail": "bill@example.com",
                          "MasterAccountId": "111111111111",
                          "Id": "o-exampleorgid",
                          "FeatureSet": "ALL",
                          "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::111111111111:organization/o-exampleorgid",
                          "AvailablePolicyTypes": [
                                  {
                                          "Status": "ENABLED",
                                          "Type": "SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY"
                                  }
                          ]
                  }
          }

              type  supported  by  Organizations other than SCPs. To determine
              which policy types are enabled in your organization, use the  ``
              ListRoots `` operation.

          Id -> (string)

              to  "CONSOLIDATED_BILLING", then only consolidated billing func-
              tionality is available. For more information, see  Enabling  All

              The unique identifier (ID) of the management account of an orga-
              nization.

              WARNING:
                 Do not use. This field is deprecated and doesn't provide com-
                 plete information about the policies in your organization.

              To determine the policies that are enabled and available for use
              in your organization, use the  ListRoots operation instead.

              (structure)
                 Contains information about a policy type and  its  status  in
                 the associated root.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The name of the policy type.

                 Status -> (string)
                     The  status of the policy type as it relates to the asso-
                     ciated root. To attach a policy of the specified type  to
                     a  root  or  to an OU or account in that root, it must be
                     available in the organization and enabled for that  root.
