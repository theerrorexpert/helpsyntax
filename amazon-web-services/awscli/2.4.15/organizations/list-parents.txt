LIST-PARENTS()                                                  LIST-PARENTS()



NAME
       list-parents -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the root or organizational units (OUs) that serve as the immedi-
       ate parent of the specified child OU or account. This operation,  along
       with   ListChildren  enables  you  to  traverse the tree structure that
       makes up this root.

       NOTE:
          Always check the NextToken response parameter for a null value  when
          calling  a List* operation. These operations can occasionally return
          an empty set of results even when there are more results  available.
          The  NextToken response parameter value is null  only when there are
          no more results to display.

       This operation can be called only from  the  organization's  management
       account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an
       AWS service.

       NOTE:
          In the current release, a child can have only a single parent.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-parents is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the  results  of  the  following  query
       expressions: Parents

SYNOPSIS
            list-parents
          --child-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --child-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier  (ID) of the OU or account whose parent con-
          tainers you want to list. Don't specify a root.

          The regex pattern for a child ID string requires one of the  follow-
          ing:

          o Account - A string that consists of exactly 12 digits.

          o Organizational  unit  (OU)  - A string that begins with "ou-" fol-
            lowed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits (the ID  of  the
            root  that  contains  the OU). This string is followed by a second
            "-" dash and from 8 to 32 additional lowercase letters or  digits.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the parent OUs or roots for an account or child OU

       The following example you how to list the root or parent OU  that  con-
       tains that account 444444444444:

          aws organizations list-parents --child-id 444444444444

       The output shows that the specified account is in the OU with specified
       ID:

          {
            "Parents": [
                  {
                    "Id": "ou-examplerootid111-exampleouid111",
                    "Type": "ORGANIZATIONAL_UNIT"
                  }
            ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Parents -> (list)
          A list of parents for the specified child account or OU.

          (structure)
              Contains information about either a root  or  an  organizational
              unit (OU) that can contain OUs or accounts in an organization.

              Id -> (string)
                 The unique identifier (ID) of the parent entity.

                 The  regex pattern for a parent ID string requires one of the
                 following:

                 o Root - A string that begins with "r-" followed by from 4 to
                   32 lowercase letters or digits.

                 o Organizational  unit (OU) - A string that begins with "ou-"
                   followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or  digits  (the
                   ID  of the root that the OU is in). This string is followed
                   by a second "-" dash and from 8 to 32 additional  lowercase
                   letters or digits.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of the parent entity.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If present, indicates that more output is available than is included
          in the current response. Use this value  in  the  NextToken  request
          parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to get the next part
          of the output. You should repeat this until the  NextToken  response
          element comes back as null .
