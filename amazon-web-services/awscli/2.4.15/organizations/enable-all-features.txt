ENABLE-ALL-FEATURES()                                    ENABLE-ALL-FEATURES()



NAME
       enable-all-features -

DESCRIPTION
       Enables  all features in an organization. This enables the use of orga-
       nization policies that can restrict the services and actions  that  can
       be  called  in  each  account.  Until you enable all features, you have
       access only to consolidated billing, and  you  can't  use  any  of  the
       advanced  account  administration  features that AWS Organizations sup-
       ports. For more information, see Enabling All Features in Your  Organi-
       zation in the AWS Organizations User Guide.

       WARNING:
          This  operation is required only for organizations that were created
          explicitly with only  the  consolidated  billing  features  enabled.
          Calling this operation sends a handshake to every invited account in
          the organization. The feature set change can be  finalized  and  the
          additional  features  enabled  only  after all administrators in the
          invited accounts approve the change by accepting the handshake.

       After you enable all features, you can  separately  enable  or  disable
       individual policy types in a root using  EnablePolicyType and  Disable-
       PolicyType . To see the status of policy types in a  root,  use   List-
       Roots .

       After  all  invited  member accounts accept the handshake, you finalize
       the feature  set  change  by  accepting  the  handshake  that  contains
       "Action": "ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES" . This completes the change.

       After  you  enable  all  features  in your organization, the management
       account in the organization can apply policies on all member  accounts.
       These policies can restrict what users and even administrators in those
       accounts can do. The management account can apply policies that prevent
       accounts from leaving the organization. Ensure that your account admin-
       istrators are aware of this.

       This operation can be called only from  the  organization's  management
       account.

SYNOPSIS
            enable-all-features
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To enable all features in an organization

       This example shows the administrator asking all the invited accounts in
       the organization to approve enabled all features in  the  organization.
       AWS Organizations sends an email to the address that is registered with
       every invited member account asking the owner to approve the change  to
       all features by accepting the handshake that is sent. After all invited
       member accounts accept the handshake,  the  organization  administrator
       can  finalize  the  change  to all features, and those with appropriate
       permissions can create policies and  apply  them  to  roots,  OUs,  and
       accounts:

          aws organizations enable-all-features

       The  output  is  a  handshake object that is sent to all invited member
       accounts for approval:

          {
                  "Handshake": {
                          "Action": "ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES",
                          "Arn":"arn:aws:organizations::111111111111:handshake/o-exampleorgid/enable_all_features/h-examplehandshakeid111",

                                  {
                                          "id":"o-exampleorgid",

                          "requestedTimestamp":1.481831868609E9,
                          "resources": [
                                  {
                                          "type":"ORGANIZATION",

OUTPUT
       Handshake -> (structure)
          A structure that contains details about  the  handshake  created  to
          support this request to enable all features in the organization.

          Id -> (string)
              The  unique  identifier  (ID)  of  a  handshake. The originating
              account creates the ID when it initiates the handshake.

              The regex pattern for handshake ID string requires "h-" followed
              by from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a handshake.

              For  more  information about ARNs in Organizations, see ARN For-
              mats Supported by Organizations in the AWS Service Authorization
              Reference .

          Parties -> (list)
              Information about the two accounts that are participating in the
              handshake.

              (structure)
                 Identifies a participant in a handshake.

                 Id -> (string)
                     The unique identifier (ID) for the party.

                     The regex pattern for handshake ID string  requires  "h-"
                     followed by from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The type of party.

          State -> (string)
              The  current  state of the handshake. Use the state to trace the
              flow of the handshake through the process from its  creation  to
              its  acceptance.  The  meaning of each of the valid values is as
              follows:

              o REQUESTED : This handshake was  sent  to  multiple  recipients
                (applicable  to only some handshake types) and not all recipi-
                ents have responded yet. The request stays in this state until
                all recipients respond.

              o OPEN  : This handshake was sent to multiple recipients (appli-
                cable to only some  policy  types)  and  all  recipients  have
                responded,  allowing  the originator to complete the handshake
                action.

              o CANCELED : This handshake is no longer active because  it  was
                canceled by the originating account.

              o ACCEPTED  :  This  handshake  is  complete because it has been
                accepted by the recipient.

              o DECLINED : This handshake is no longer active because  it  was
                declined by the recipient account.

              o EXPIRED : This handshake is no longer active because the orig-
                inator did not receive a response of any kind from the recipi-
                ent before the expiration time (15 days).

          RequestedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the handshake request was made.

          ExpirationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The  date  and time that the handshake expires. If the recipient
              of the handshake request fails to respond before  the  specified
              date  and  time, the handshake becomes inactive and is no longer
              valid.

          Action -> (string)
              The type of handshake, indicating what action  occurs  when  the
              recipient  accepts  the handshake. The following handshake types
              are supported:

              o INVITE : This type of handshake represents a request  to  join
                an organization. It is always sent from the management account
                to only non-member accounts.

              o ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES : This  type  of  handshake  represents  a
                request  to  enable  all  features  in  an organization. It is
                always sent from the management account to only invited member
                accounts.  Created  accounts do not receive this because those
                accounts were created by the organization's management account
                and approval is inferred.

              o APPROVE_ALL_FEATURES : This type of handshake is sent from the
                Organizations service when all member accounts  have  approved
                the  ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES  invitation.  It  is sent only to the
                management account and signals the master that it can finalize
                the process to enable all features.

          Resources -> (list)
              Additional  information that is needed to process the handshake.

              (structure)
                 Contains additional data that is needed to  process  a  hand-
                 shake.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  information that is passed to the other party in the
                     handshake. The format of the value string must match  the
                     requirements of the specified type.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The  type of information being passed, specifying how the
                     value is to be interpreted by the other party:

                     o NOTES  - Additional text provided by the handshake ini-
                       tiator and intended for the recipient to read.

                 Resources -> (list)
                     When needed, contains an additional array of HandshakeRe-
                     source objects.

                     (structure)
                        Contains  additional  data that is needed to process a
                        handshake.

                        Value -> (string)
