LIST-POLICIES()                                                LIST-POLICIES()



NAME
       list-policies -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  list  of all policies in an organization of a specified
       type.

       NOTE:
          Always check the NextToken response parameter for a null value  when
          calling  a List* operation. These operations can occasionally return
          an empty set of results even when there are more results  available.
          The  NextToken response parameter value is null  only when there are
          no more results to display.

       This operation can be called only from  the  organization's  management
       account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an
       AWS service.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-policies is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Policies

SYNOPSIS
            list-policies
          --filter <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filter (string)
          Specifies  the  type  of  policy  that  you  want  to include in the
          response. You must specify one of the following values:

          o AISERVICES_OPT_OUT_POLICY

          o BACKUP_POLICY

          o SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY

          o TAG_POLICY

          Possible values:

          o SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY

          o TAG_POLICY

          o BACKUP_POLICY

          o AISERVICES_OPT_OUT_POLICY

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve a list of all policies in an organization of a certain type

       The following example shows you how to get a list of SCPs, as specified
       by the filter parameter:

          aws organizations list-policies --filter SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY

       The output includes a list of policies with summary information:

          {
                  "Policies": [
                          {
                                  "Type": "SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY",
                                  "Name": "AllowAllS3Actions",
                                  "AwsManaged": false,
                                  "Id": "p-examplepolicyid111",
                                  "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::111111111111:policy/service_control_policy/p-examplepolicyid111",
                                  "Description": "Enables account admins to delegate permissions for any S3 actions to users and roles in their accounts."
                          },
                          {
                                  "Type": "SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY",
                                  "Name": "AllowAllEC2Actions",
                                  "AwsManaged": false,
                                  "Id": "p-examplepolicyid222",
                                  "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::111111111111:policy/service_control_policy/p-examplepolicyid222",
                                  "Description": "Enables account admins to delegate permissions for any EC2 actions to users and roles in their accounts."
                          },
                          {
                                  "AwsManaged": true,
                                  "Description": "Allows access to every operation",
                                  "Type": "SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY",
                                  "Id": "p-FullAWSAccess",
                                  "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::aws:policy/service_control_policy/p-FullAWSAccess",
                                  "Name": "FullAWSAccess"
                          }
                  ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Policies -> (list)
          A  list  of  policies that match the filter criteria in the request.
          The output list doesn't include the policy contents. To see the con-
          tent for a policy, see  DescribePolicy .

          (structure)
              Contains  information  about  a policy, but does not include the
              content. To see the content of a policy, see  DescribePolicy .

              Id -> (string)
                 The unique identifier (ID) of the policy.

                 The regex pattern for a policy ID string requires  "p-"  fol-
                 lowed  by  from 8 to 128 lowercase or uppercase letters, dig-
                 its, or the underscore character (_).

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy.

                 For more information about ARNs  in  Organizations,  see  ARN
                 Formats  Supported by Organizations in the AWS Service Autho-
                 rization Reference .

              Name -> (string)
                 The friendly name of the policy.

                 The regex pattern that is used to validate this parameter  is
                 a  string  of  any  of  the characters in the ASCII character
                 range.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the policy.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of policy.

              AwsManaged -> (boolean)
                 A boolean value that indicates whether the  specified  policy
                 is  an  AWS  managed policy. If true, then you can attach the
                 policy to roots, OUs, or accounts, but you cannot edit it.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If present, indicates that more output is available than is included
          in  the  current  response.  Use this value in the NextToken request
          parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to get the next part
          of  the  output. You should repeat this until the NextToken response
          element comes back as null .
