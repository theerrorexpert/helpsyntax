SYNOPSIS
            tag-resource
          --resource-id <value>
          --tags <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-id (string)
          The ID of the resource to add a tag to.

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags to add to the specified resource.

          You can specify any of the following taggable resources.

          o AWS account  specify the account ID number.

          o Organizational  unit   specify  the OU ID that begins with ou- and
            looks similar to:
            ``
            ou-1a2b-34uvwxyz ``

          o Root  specify the root ID that begins with r-  and  looks  similar
            to:
            ``
            r-1a2b ``

          o Policy  specify the policy ID that begins with p- andlooks similar
            to:
            ``
            p-12abcdefg3 ``

          For each tag in the list, you must specify both  a  tag  key  and  a
          value.  You  can set the value to an empty string, but you can't set
          it to null .

          NOTE:
              If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed  the  allowed
              number  of  tags  for  an  account user, then the entire request
              fails and the account is not created.

          (structure)
              A custom key-value pair associated with a resource  within  your
              organization.

              You  can  attach  tags  to  any  of  the  following organization
              resources.

              o AWS account

              o Organizational unit (OU)

              o Organization root

              o Policy

              Key -> (string)
                 The key identifier, or name, of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The string value that's associated with the key of  the  tag.
                 You  can  set  the value of a tag to an empty string, but you
                 can't set the value of a tag to null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
