CREATE-GOV-CLOUD-ACCOUNT()                          CREATE-GOV-CLOUD-ACCOUNT()



NAME
       create-gov-cloud-account -

DESCRIPTION
       This action is available if all of the following are true:

       o You're authorized to create accounts in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region.
         For more information on the AWS GovCloud (US) Region, see the  `  AWS
         GovCloud             User            Guide            .            <-
         http://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/wel-
         come.html>`__

       o You  already  have an account in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region that is
         paired with a management account of an organization in the commercial
         Region.

       o You call this action from the management account of your organization
         in the commercial Region.

       o You have the organizations:CreateGovCloudAccount permission.

       AWS Organizations automatically  creates  the  required  service-linked
       role  named  AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations . For more information, see
       AWS Organizations and Service-Linked Roles  in  the  AWS  Organizations
       User Guide.

       AWS   automatically  enables  AWS  CloudTrail  for  AWS  GovCloud  (US)
       accounts, but you should also do the following:

       o Verify that AWS CloudTrail is enabled to store logs.

       o Create an S3 bucket for AWS CloudTrail log storage. For more informa-
         tion,  see  Verifying  AWS  CloudTrail Is Enabled in the AWS GovCloud
         User Guide .

       If the request includes tags, then the requester must have the  organi-
       zations:TagResource permission. The tags are attached to the commercial
       account associated with the GovCloud account, rather than the  GovCloud
       account  itself.  To add tags to the GovCloud account, call the  TagRe-
       source operation in the GovCloud Region after the new GovCloud  account
       exists.

       You  call  this action from the management account of your organization
       in the commercial Region to create a standalone AWS account in the  AWS
       GovCloud  (US)  Region.  After  the  account is created, the management
       account of an organization in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region  can  invite
       it  to  that  organization. For more information on inviting standalone
       accounts in the AWS GovCloud (US) to  join  an  organization,  see  AWS
       Organizations in the AWS GovCloud User Guide.

       Calling  CreateGovCloudAccount is an asynchronous request that AWS per-
       forms in the background. Because CreateGovCloudAccount  operates  asyn-
       chronously,  it  can return a successful completion message even though
       account initialization might still be in progress. You  might  need  to
       wait  a  few minutes before you can successfully access the account. To
       check the status of the request, do one of the following:

       o Use the OperationId response element from this operation  to  provide
         as a parameter to the  DescribeCreateAccountStatus operation.

       o Check  the  AWS CloudTrail log for the CreateAccountResult event. For
         information  on  using  AWS  CloudTrail   with   Organizations,   see
         Monitoring the Activity in Your Organization in the AWS Organizations
         User Guide.

       When  you  call  the  CreateGovCloudAccount  action,  you  create   two
       accounts:  a  standalone account in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region and an
       associated account in the commercial Region  for  billing  and  support
       purposes.  The account in the commercial Region is automatically a mem-
       ber of the  organization  whose  credentials  made  the  request.  Both
       accounts are associated with the same email address.

       A  role  is  created  in  the new account in the commercial Region that
       allows the management account in the  organization  in  the  commercial
       Region  to  assume it. An AWS GovCloud (US) account is then created and
       associated with the commercial account that you just created. A role is
       also  created  in the new AWS GovCloud (US) account that can be assumed
       by the AWS GovCloud (US) account that is associated with the management
       account  of  the  commercial  organization. For more information and to
       view a diagram that explains how account access works, see AWS  Organi-
       zations in the AWS GovCloud User Guide.

       For  more  information  about  creating  accounts,  see Creating an AWS
       Account in Your Organization in the AWS Organizations User Guide.

       WARNING:

          o When you create an account in an organization using the AWS  Orga-
            nizations  console, API, or CLI commands, the information required
            for the account to operate as a standalone account is not automat-
            ically  collected.  This includes a payment method and signing the
            end user license agreement (EULA). If you must remove  an  account
            from your organization later, you can do so only after you provide
            the missing information. Follow the steps at To leave an organiza-
            tion as a member account in the AWS Organizations User Guide.

          o If  you  get  an  exception  that indicates that you exceeded your
            account limits for the organization, contact AWS Support .

          o If you get an exception that indicates that the  operation  failed
            because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and
            then try again. If the error persists, contact AWS Support .

          o Using CreateGovCloudAccount to create multiple temporary  accounts
            isn't  recommended.  You  can  only  close an account from the AWS
            Billing and Cost Management console, and you must be signed in  as
            the root user. For information on the requirements and process for
            closing an account, see Closing an AWS Account in the AWS  Organi-
            zations User Guide .

       NOTE:
          When you create a member account with this operation, you can choose
          whether to create the account with the IAM User and Role  Access  to
          Billing  Information switch enabled. If you enable it, IAM users and
          roles that have appropriate permissions can view billing information
          for  the  account. If you disable it, only the account root user can
          access billing information. For information  about  how  to  disable
          this  switch  for  an  account,  see Granting Access to Your Billing
          Information and Tools .

SYNOPSIS
            create-gov-cloud-account
          --email <value>
          --account-name <value>
          [--role-name <value>]
          [--iam-user-access-to-billing <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --email (string)
          The email address of the owner to assign to the new  member  account
          in  the  commercial  Region.  This email address must not already be
          associated with another AWS account. You  must  use  a  valid  email
          address to complete account creation. You can't access the root user
          of the account or remove an account that was created with an invalid
          email address. Like all request parameters for CreateGovCloudAccount
          , the request for the  email  address  for  the  AWS  GovCloud  (US)
          account originates from the commercial Region, not from the AWS Gov-
          Cloud (US) Region.

       --account-name (string)
          The friendly name of the member account.

       --role-name (string)
          (Optional)

          The name of an IAM role that AWS Organizations automatically precon-
          figures  in  the  new  member accounts in both the AWS GovCloud (US)
          Region and in the commercial Region. This role trusts the management
          account,  allowing  users  in  the  management account to assume the
          role, as permitted by the management account administrator. The role
          has administrator permissions in the new member account.

          If you don't specify this parameter, the role name defaults to Orga-
          nizationAccountAccessRole .

          For more information about how to use this role to access the member
          account, see Accessing and Administering the Member Accounts in Your
          Organization in the AWS Organizations User Guide and steps 2  and  3
          in  Tutorial: Delegate Access Across AWS Accounts Using IAM Roles in
          the IAM User Guide.

          The regex pattern that is used to validate this parameter. The  pat-
          tern  can  include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits with
          no spaces, and any of the following characters: =,.@-

       --iam-user-access-to-billing (string)
          If set to ALLOW , the new linked account in  the  commercial  Region
          enables IAM users to access account billing information if they have
          the required permissions. If set to DENY , only the root user of the
          new  account can access account billing information. For more infor-
          mation, see Activating Access to the  Billing  and  Cost  Management
          Console in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide.

          If  you  don't specify this parameter, the value defaults to ALLOW ,
          and IAM users and roles with the  required  permissions  can  access
          billing information for the new account.

          Possible values:

          o ALLOW

          o DENY

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags that you want to attach to the newly created account.
          These tags are attached to the commercial  account  associated  with
          the GovCloud account, and not to the GovCloud account itself. To add
          tags to the actual GovCloud account, call the  TagResource operation
          in the GovCloud region after the new GovCloud account exists.

          For  each  tag  in  the  list, you must specify both a tag key and a
          value. You can set the value to an empty string, but you  can't  set
          it  to  null  .  For more information about tagging, see Tagging AWS
          Organizations resources in the AWS Organizations User Guide.

          NOTE:
              If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed  the  allowed
              number of tags for an account, then the entire request fails and
              the account is not created.

          (structure)
              A custom key-value pair associated with a resource  within  your
              organization.

              You  can  attach  tags  to  any  of  the  following organization
              resources.

              o AWS account

              o Organizational unit (OU)

              o Organization root

              o Policy

              Key -> (string)
                 The key identifier, or name, of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The string value that's associated with the key of  the  tag.
                 You  can  set  the value of a tag to an empty string, but you
                 can't set the value of a tag to null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CreateAccountStatus -> (structure)
          Contains the status about a  CreateAccount or  CreateGovCloudAccount
          request  to create an AWS account or an AWS GovCloud (US) account in
          an organization.

          Id -> (string)
              The unique identifier (ID) that references this request. You get
              this  value  from  the  response  of  the initial  CreateAccount
              request to create the account.

              The regex  pattern  for  a  create  account  request  ID  string
              requires  "car-"  followed  by from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or
              digits.

          AccountName -> (string)
              The account name given to the account when it was created.

          State -> (string)
              The status of the asynchronous request to create an AWS account.

          RequestedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the request was made for the account cre-
              ation.

          CompletedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the account was created and  the  request
              completed.

          AccountId -> (string)
              If  the  account was created successfully, the unique identifier
              (ID) of the new account.

              The regex pattern for an account ID string requires  exactly  12
              digits.

          GovCloudAccountId -> (string)
              If  the  account was created successfully, the unique identifier
              (ID) of the new account in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region.

          FailureReason -> (string)
              If the request failed, a description of the reason for the fail-
              ure.

              o ACCOUNT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED:   The   account  couldn't  be  created
                because you reached the limit on the  number  of  accounts  in
                your organization.

              o CONCURRENT_ACCOUNT_MODIFICATION:   You   already  submitted  a
                request with the same information.

              o EMAIL_ALREADY_EXISTS: The account could not be created because
                another AWS account with that email address already exists.

              o FAILED_BUSINESS_VALIDATION:  The  AWS  account  that owns your
                organization failed to receive business license validation.

              o GOVCLOUD_ACCOUNT_ALREADY_EXISTS: The account in the  AWS  Gov-
                Cloud  (US)  Region  could  not be created because this Region
                already includes an account with that email address.

              o IDENTITY_INVALID_BUSINESS_VALIDATION:  The  AWS  account  that
                owns your organization can't complete business license valida-
                tion because it doesn't have valid identity data.

              o INVALID_ADDRESS: The account could not be created because  the
                address you provided is not valid.

              o INVALID_EMAIL:  The  account  could not be created because the
                email address you provided is not valid.

              o INTERNAL_FAILURE: The account could not be created because  of
                an internal failure. Try again later. If the problem persists,
                contact AWS Customer Support.

              o MISSING_BUSINESS_VALIDATION: The AWS account  that  owns  your
                organization has not received Business Validation.

              o MISSING_PAYMENT_INSTRUMENT:  You must configure the management
                account with a valid payment method, such as a credit card.

              o PENDING_BUSINESS_VALIDATION: The AWS account  that  owns  your
                organization  is  still  in the process of completing business
                license validation.

              o UNKNOWN_BUSINESS_VALIDATION: The AWS account  that  owns  your
                organization  has an unknown issue with business license vali-
                dation.
