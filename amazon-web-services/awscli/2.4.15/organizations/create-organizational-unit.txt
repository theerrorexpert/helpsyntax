CREATE-ORGANIZATIONAL-UNIT()                      CREATE-ORGANIZATIONAL-UNIT()



NAME
       create-organizational-unit -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  organizational unit (OU) within a root or parent OU. An OU
       is a container for accounts that enables you to organize your  accounts
       to  apply  policies according to your business requirements. The number
       of levels deep that you can nest OUs is dependent upon the policy types
       enabled for that root. For service control policies, the limit is five.

       For more information about OUs, see Managing  Organizational  Units  in
       the AWS Organizations User Guide.

       If  the request includes tags, then the requester must have the organi-
       zations:TagResource permission.

       This operation can be called only from  the  organization's  management
       account.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-organizational-unit
          --parent-id <value>
          --name <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --parent-id (string)
          The unique identifier (ID) of the parent root or OU that you want to
          create the new OU in.

          The regex pattern for a parent ID string requires one of the follow-
          ing:

          o Root  -  A  string  that begins with "r-" followed by from 4 to 32
            lowercase letters or digits.

          o Organizational unit (OU) - A string that begins  with  "ou-"  fol-
            lowed  by  from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits (the ID of the
            root that the OU is in). This string is followed by a  second  "-"
            dash and from 8 to 32 additional lowercase letters or digits.

       --name (string)
          The friendly name to assign to the new OU.

       --tags (list)
          A  list of tags that you want to attach to the newly created OU. For
          each tag in the list, you must specify both a tag key and  a  value.
          You  can  set  the value to an empty string, but you can't set it to
          null . For more information about tagging, see Tagging AWS Organiza-
          tions resources in the AWS Organizations User Guide.

          NOTE:
              If  any  one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed
              number of tags for an OU, then the entire request fails and  the
              OU is not created.

          (structure)
              A  custom  key-value pair associated with a resource within your
              organization.

              You can  attach  tags  to  any  of  the  following  organization
              resources.

              o AWS account

              o Organizational unit (OU)

              o Organization root

              o Policy

              Key -> (string)
                 The key identifier, or name, of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  string  value that's associated with the key of the tag.
                 You can set the value of a tag to an empty  string,  but  you
                 can't set the value of a tag to null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create an OU in a root or parent OU

       The  following  example  shows  how  to  create  an  OU  that  is named
       AccountingOU:

          aws organizations create-organizational-unit --parent-id r-examplerootid111 --name AccountingOU

       The output includes an organizationalUnit object with details about the
       new OU:

          {
                  "OrganizationalUnit": {
                          "Id": "ou-examplerootid111-exampleouid111",
                          "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::111111111111:ou/o-exampleorgid/ou-examplerootid111-exampleouid111",
                          "Name": "AccountingOU"
                  }
          }

OUTPUT
       OrganizationalUnit -> (structure)
          A structure that contains details about the newly created OU.

          Id -> (string)
              The unique identifier (ID) associated with this OU.

              The  regex pattern for an organizational unit ID string requires
              "ou-" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits  (the
              ID of the root that contains the OU). This string is followed by
              a second "-" dash and from 8 to 32 additional lowercase  letters
              or digits.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this OU.

              For  more  information about ARNs in Organizations, see ARN For-
              mats Supported by Organizations in the AWS Service Authorization
              Reference .

          Name -> (string)
              The friendly name of this OU.

              The  regex  pattern that is used to validate this parameter is a
              string of any of the characters in the ASCII character range.
