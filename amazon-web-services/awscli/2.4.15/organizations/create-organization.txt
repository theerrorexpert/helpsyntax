CREATE-ORGANIZATION()                                    CREATE-ORGANIZATION()



NAME
       create-organization -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an AWS organization. The account whose user is calling the Cre-
       ateOrganization operation automatically becomes the management  account
       of the new organization.

       This  operation  must be called using credentials from the account that
       is to become the new organization's management account.  The  principal
       must also have the relevant IAM permissions.

       By  default  (or  if you set the FeatureSet parameter to ALL ), the new
       organization is created with all features enabled and  service  control
       policies  automatically  enabled  in the root. If you instead choose to
       create the organization supporting only the consolidated  billing  fea-
       tures by setting the FeatureSet parameter to CONSOLIDATED_BILLING" , no
       policy types are enabled by default, and  you  can't  use  organization
       policies

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-organization
          [--feature-set <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --feature-set (string)
          Specifies  the  feature  set supported by the new organization. Each
          feature set supports different levels of functionality.

          o CONSOLIDATED_BILLING : All member accounts have their  bills  con-
            solidated to and paid by the management account. For more informa-
            tion, see Consolidated  billing  in  the  AWS  Organizations  User
            Guide.    The  consolidated billing feature subset isn't available
            for organizations in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region.

          o ALL : In addition to all the features supported  by  the  consoli-
            dated  billing  feature set, the management account can also apply
            any policy type to any member account  in  the  organization.  For
            more  information,  see All features in the AWS Organizations User
            Guide.

          Possible values:

          o ALL

          o CONSOLIDATED_BILLING

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To create a new organization

       Bill wants to create an organization  using  credentials  from  account
       111111111111.  The following example shows that the account becomes the
       master account in the new organization. Because he does not  specify  a
       features set, the new organization defaults to all features enabled and
       service control policies are enabled on the root.

          aws organizations create-organization

       The output includes an organization object with details about  the  new
       organization:

          {
                  "Organization": {
                          "AvailablePolicyTypes": [
                                  {
                                          "Status": "ENABLED",
                                          "Type": "SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY"
                                  }
                          ],
                          "MasterAccountId": "111111111111",
                          "MasterAccountArn": "arn:aws:organizations::111111111111:account/o-exampleorgid/111111111111",
                          "MasterAccountEmail": "bill@example.com",
                          "FeatureSet": "ALL",
                          "Id": "o-exampleorgid",
                          "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::111111111111:organization/o-exampleorgid"
                  }
          }

       Example  2: To create a new organization with only consolidated billing
       features enabled

       The following example creates an organization that  supports  only  the
       consolidated billing features:

          aws organizations create-organization --feature-set CONSOLIDATED_BILLING

       The  output  includes an organization object with details about the new
       organization:

          {
                  "Organization": {
                          "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::111111111111:organization/o-exampleorgid",
                          "AvailablePolicyTypes": [],
                          "Id": "o-exampleorgid",
                          "MasterAccountArn": "arn:aws:organizations::111111111111:account/o-exampleorgid/111111111111",
                          "MasterAccountEmail": "bill@example.com",
                          "MasterAccountId": "111111111111",
                          "FeatureSet": "CONSOLIDATED_BILLING"
                  }
          }

                 plete information about the policies in your organization.

              To determine the policies that are enabled and available for use
              in your organization, use the  ListRoots operation instead.
