LEAVE-ORGANIZATION()                                      LEAVE-ORGANIZATION()



NAME
       leave-organization -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  a member account from its parent organization. This version of
       the operation is performed by the  account  that  wants  to  leave.  To
       remove  a  member  account  as  a  user  in the management account, use
       RemoveAccountFromOrganization instead.

       This operation can be called only from a member account in the  organi-
       zation.

       WARNING:

          o The  management  account  in  an  organization  with  all features
            enabled can set service control policies (SCPs) that can  restrict
            what  administrators of member accounts can do. This includes pre-
            venting them from successfully calling LeaveOrganization and leav-
            ing the organization.

          o You  can  leave  an  organization  as a member account only if the
            account is configured with the information required to operate  as
            a  standalone  account. When you create an account in an organiza-
            tion using the AWS Organizations console, API,  or  CLI  commands,
            the  information  required of standalone accounts is not automati-
            cally collected. For each account that you  want  to  make  stand-
            alone,  you  must perform the following steps. If any of the steps
            are already completed for this account, that step doesn't  appear.

            o Choose a support plan

            o Provide and verify the required contact information

            o Provide a current payment method

          AWS  uses  the  payment  method to charge for any billable (not free
          tier) AWS activity that occurs while the account isn't  attached  to
          an  organization.  Follow the steps at To leave an organization when
          all required account information has not yet been  provided  in  the
          AWS Organizations User Guide.

          o The  account that you want to leave must not be a delegated admin-
            istrator account for any AWS service enabled  for  your  organiza-
            tion.  If the account is a delegated administrator, you must first
            change the delegated administrator account to another account that
            is remaining in the organization.

          o You  can  leave  an  organization  only  after you enable IAM user
            access to billing in  your  account.  For  more  information,  see
            Activating  Access  to  the Billing and Cost Management Console in
            the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide.

          o After the account leaves the  organization,  all  tags  that  were
            attached  to  the  account object in the organization are deleted.
            AWS accounts outside of an organization do not support tags.

          o A newly created account has a waiting  period  before  it  can  be
            removed  from its organization. If you get an error that indicates
            that a wait period is required, then try again in a few days.

SYNOPSIS
            leave-organization
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
