ENABLE-POLICY-TYPE()                                      ENABLE-POLICY-TYPE()



NAME
       enable-policy-type -

DESCRIPTION
       Enables  a  policy  type in a root. After you enable a policy type in a
       root, you can attach policies of that type to the root,  any  organiza-
       tional  unit  (OU), or account in that root. You can undo this by using
       the  DisablePolicyType operation.

       This is an asynchronous request that AWS performs  in  the  background.
       AWS  recommends that you first use  ListRoots to see the status of pol-
       icy types for a specified root, and then use this operation.

       This operation can be called only from  the  organization's  management
       account.

       You  can  enable  a  policy  type in a root only if that policy type is
       available in the organization. To view the status of  available  policy
       types in the organization, use  DescribeOrganization .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            enable-policy-type
          --root-id <value>
          --policy-type <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --root-id (string)
          The unique identifier (ID) of the root in which you want to enable a
          policy type. You can get the ID from the  ListRoots operation.

          The regex pattern for a root ID string  requires  "r-"  followed  by
          from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.

       --policy-type (string)
          The  policy type that you want to enable. You can specify one of the
          following values:

          o AISERVICES_OPT_OUT_POLICY

          o BACKUP_POLICY

          o SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY

          o TAG_POLICY

          Possible values:

          o SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY

          o TAG_POLICY

          o BACKUP_POLICY

          o AISERVICES_OPT_OUT_POLICY

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To enable the use of a policy type in a root

       The following example shows how to enable the  service  control  policy
       (SCP) policy type in a root:

          aws organizations enable-policy-type --root-id r-examplerootid111 --policy-type SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY

       The  output  shows  a  root  object with a policyTypes response element
       showing that SCPs are now enabled:

          {
                  "Root": {
                          "PolicyTypes": [
                                  {
                                          "Status":"ENABLED",
                                          "Type":"SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY"
                                  }
                          ],
                          "Id": "r-examplerootid111",
                          "Name": "Root",
                          "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::111111111111:root/o-exampleorgid/r-examplerootid111"
                  }
          }

OUTPUT
       Root -> (structure)
          A structure that shows the root with the  updated  list  of  enabled
          policy types.

          Id -> (string)
              The unique identifier (ID) for the root.

              The regex pattern for a root ID string requires "r-" followed by
              from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the root.

              For more information about ARNs in Organizations, see  ARN  For-
              mats Supported by Organizations in the AWS Service Authorization
              Reference .

          Name -> (string)
              The friendly name of the root.

              The regex pattern that is used to validate this parameter  is  a
              string of any of the characters in the ASCII character range.

          PolicyTypes -> (list)
              The  types  of  policies that are currently enabled for the root
              and therefore can be attached to the  root  or  to  its  OUs  or
              accounts.

              NOTE:
                 Even  if a policy type is shown as available in the organiza-
                 tion, you can separately enable and disable them at the  root
                 level by using  EnablePolicyType and  DisablePolicyType . Use
                 DescribeOrganization to see the availability  of  the  policy
                 types in that organization.

              (structure)
                 Contains  information  about  a policy type and its status in
                 the associated root.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The name of the policy type.

                 Status -> (string)
                     The status of the policy type as it relates to the  asso-
                     ciated  root. To attach a policy of the specified type to
                     a root or to an OU or account in that root,  it  must  be
                     available  in the organization and enabled for that root.
