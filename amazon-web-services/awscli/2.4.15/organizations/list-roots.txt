LIST-ROOTS()                                                      LIST-ROOTS()



NAME
       list-roots -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the roots that are defined in the current organization.

       NOTE:
          Always  check the NextToken response parameter for a null value when
          calling a List* operation. These operations can occasionally  return
          an  empty set of results even when there are more results available.
          The NextToken response parameter value is null  only when there  are
          no more results to display.

       This  operation  can  be called only from the organization's management
       account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an
       AWS service.

       NOTE:
          Policy  types can be enabled and disabled in roots. This is distinct
          from whether they're available in the organization. When you  enable
          all  features, you make policy types available for use in that orga-
          nization. Individual policy types can then be enabled  and  disabled
          in  a root. To see the availability of a policy type in an organiza-
          tion, use  DescribeOrganization .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-roots is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the  results  of  the  following  query
       expressions: Roots

SYNOPSIS
            list-roots
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve a list of the roots in an organization

       This example shows you how to get the list of roots  for  an  organiza-
       tion:

          aws organizations list-roots

       The output includes a list of root structures with summary information:

          {
                  "Roots": [
                          {
                                  "Name": "Root",
                                  "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::111111111111:root/o-exampleorgid/r-examplerootid111",
                                  "Id": "r-examplerootid111",
                                  "PolicyTypes": [
                                          {
                                                  "Status":"ENABLED",
                                                  "Type":"SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY"
                                          }
                                  ]
                          }
                  ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Roots -> (list)
          A list of roots that are defined in an organization.

          (structure)
              Contains details about a root. A root is a top-level parent node
              in  the  hierarchy of an organization that can contain organiza-
              tional units (OUs) and accounts. The  root  contains  every  AWS
              account in the organization.

              Id -> (string)
                 The unique identifier (ID) for the root.

                 The regex pattern for a root ID string requires "r-" followed
                 by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the root.

                 For more information about ARNs  in  Organizations,  see  ARN
                 Formats  Supported by Organizations in the AWS Service Autho-
                 rization Reference .

              Name -> (string)
                 The friendly name of the root.

                 The regex pattern that is used to validate this parameter  is
                 a  string  of  any  of  the characters in the ASCII character
                 range.

              PolicyTypes -> (list)
                 The types of policies that are currently enabled for the root
                 and  therefore  can  be attached to the root or to its OUs or
                 accounts.

                 NOTE:
                     Even if a policy type is shown as available in the  orga-
                     nization,  you  can separately enable and disable them at
                     the root level by using  EnablePolicyType  and   Disable-
                     PolicyType  . Use  DescribeOrganization to see the avail-
                     ability of the policy types in that organization.

                 (structure)
                     Contains information about a policy type and  its  status
                     in the associated root.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The name of the policy type.

                     Status -> (string)
                        The  status  of  the  policy type as it relates to the
                        associated root. To attach a policy of  the  specified
                        type to a root or to an OU or account in that root, it
                        must be available in the organization and enabled  for
                        that root.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If present, indicates that more output is available than is included
          in the current response. Use this value  in  the  NextToken  request
          parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to get the next part
          of the output. You should repeat this until the  NextToken  response
          element comes back as null .
