DESCRIBE-EFFECTIVE-POLICY()                        DESCRIBE-EFFECTIVE-POLICY()



NAME
       describe-effective-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the contents of the effective policy for specified policy type
       and account. The effective policy is the aggregation of any policies of
       the  specified  type that the account inherits, plus any policy of that
       type that is directly attached to the account.

       This operation applies only to policy types other than service  control
       policies (SCPs).

       For  more  information about policy inheritance, see How Policy Inheri-
       tance Works in the AWS Organizations User Guide .

       This operation can be called only from  the  organization's  management
       account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an
       AWS service.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-effective-policy
          --policy-type <value>
          [--target-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --policy-type (string)
          The type of policy that you want information about. You can  specify
          one of the following values:

          o AISERVICES_OPT_OUT_POLICY

          o BACKUP_POLICY

          o TAG_POLICY

          Possible values:

          o TAG_POLICY

          o BACKUP_POLICY

          o AISERVICES_OPT_OUT_POLICY

       --target-id (string)
          When  you're  signed in as the management account, specify the ID of
          the account that you want details about. Specifying an  organization
          root or organizational unit (OU) as the target is not supported.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          LastUpdatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
