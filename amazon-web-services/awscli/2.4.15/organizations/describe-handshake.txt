DESCRIBE-HANDSHAKE()                                      DESCRIBE-HANDSHAKE()



NAME
       describe-handshake -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information about a previously requested handshake. The hand-
       shake ID comes from the response to the original   InviteAccountToOrga-
       nization operation that generated the handshake.

       You  can  access  handshakes that are ACCEPTED , DECLINED , or CANCELED
       for only 30 days after they change to that state. They're then  deleted
       and no longer accessible.

       This operation can be called from any account in the organization.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-handshake
          --handshake-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --handshake-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier (ID) of the handshake that you want informa-
          tion about. You can get the ID from the original call to   InviteAc-
          countToOrganization , or from a call to  ListHandshakesForAccount or
          ListHandshakesForOrganization .

          The regex pattern for handshake ID string requires "h-" followed  by
          from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about a handshake

       The  following  example  shows you how to request details about a hand-
       shake. The  handshake  ID  comes  either  from  the  original  call  to
       InviteAccountToOrganization, or from a call to ListHandshakesForAccount
       or ListHandshakesForOrganization:

          aws organizations describe-handshake --handshake-id h-examplehandshakeid111

       The output includes a handshake object that has all the  details  about
       the requested handshake:

          {
                  "Handshake": {
                          "Id": "h-examplehandshakeid111",

OUTPUT
       Handshake -> (structure)
          A structure that contains information about the specified handshake.

          Id -> (string)
              The unique identifier  (ID)  of  a  handshake.  The  originating
              account creates the ID when it initiates the handshake.

              The regex pattern for handshake ID string requires "h-" followed
              by from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a handshake.

              For more information about ARNs in Organizations, see  ARN  For-
              mats Supported by Organizations in the AWS Service Authorization
              Reference .

          Parties -> (list)
              Information about the two accounts that are participating in the
              handshake.

              (structure)
                 Identifies a participant in a handshake.

                 Id -> (string)
                     The unique identifier (ID) for the party.

                     The  regex  pattern for handshake ID string requires "h-"
                     followed by from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The type of party.

          State -> (string)
              The current state of the handshake. Use the state to  trace  the
              flow  of  the handshake through the process from its creation to
              its acceptance. The meaning of each of the valid  values  is  as
              follows:

              o REQUESTED  :  This  handshake  was sent to multiple recipients
                (applicable to only some handshake types) and not all  recipi-
                ents have responded yet. The request stays in this state until
                all recipients respond.

              o OPEN : This handshake was sent to multiple recipients  (appli-
                cable  to  only  some  policy  types)  and all recipients have
                responded, allowing the originator to complete  the  handshake
                action.

              o CANCELED  :  This handshake is no longer active because it was
                canceled by the originating account.

              o ACCEPTED : This handshake is  complete  because  it  has  been
                accepted by the recipient.

              o DECLINED  :  This handshake is no longer active because it was
                declined by the recipient account.

              o EXPIRED : This handshake is no longer active because the orig-
                inator did not receive a response of any kind from the recipi-
                ent before the expiration time (15 days).

          RequestedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the handshake request was made.

          ExpirationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the handshake expires. If  the  recipient
              of  the  handshake request fails to respond before the specified
              date and time, the handshake becomes inactive and is  no  longer
              valid.

          Action -> (string)
              The  type  of  handshake, indicating what action occurs when the
              recipient accepts the handshake. The following  handshake  types
              are supported:

              o INVITE  :  This type of handshake represents a request to join
                an organization. It is always sent from the management account
                to only non-member accounts.

              o ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES  :  This  type  of  handshake represents a
                request to enable all  features  in  an  organization.  It  is
                always sent from the management account to only invited member
                accounts. Created accounts do not receive this  because  those
                accounts were created by the organization's management account
                and approval is inferred.

              o APPROVE_ALL_FEATURES : This type of handshake is sent from the
                Organizations  service  when all member accounts have approved
                the ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES invitation. It is  sent  only  to  the
                management account and signals the master that it can finalize
                the process to enable all features.

          Resources -> (list)
              Additional information that is needed to process the  handshake.

              (structure)
                 Contains  additional  data  that is needed to process a hand-
                 shake.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The information that is passed to the other party in  the
                     handshake.  The format of the value string must match the
                     requirements of the specified type.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The type of information being passed, specifying how  the
                     value is to be interpreted by the other party:

                     o ACCOUNT - Specifies an AWS account ID number.

                     o ORGANIZATION - Specifies an organization ID number.

                       with the account that receives the handshake.

                     o OWNER_EMAIL - Specifies the  email  address  associated
                       with  the  management  account. Included as information

                     o NOTES - Additional text provided by the handshake  ini-
                       tiator and intended for the recipient to read.

                 Resources -> (list)
                     When needed, contains an additional array of HandshakeRe-
                     source objects.

                     (structure)
                        Contains additional data that is needed to  process  a
                        handshake.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  information that is passed to the other party
                            in the handshake. The format of the  value  string
                            must match the requirements of the specified type.
