CREATE-POLICY()                                                CREATE-POLICY()



NAME
       create-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a policy of a specified type that you can attach to a root, an
       organizational unit (OU), or an individual AWS account.

       For more information about policies and their use, see Managing Organi-
       zation Policies .

       If  the request includes tags, then the requester must have the organi-
       zations:TagResource permission.

       This operation can be called only from  the  organization's  management
       account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-policy
          --content <value>
          --description <value>
          --name <value>
          --type <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --content (string)
          The  policy text content to add to the new policy. The text that you
          supply must adhere to the rules of the policy type  you  specify  in
          the Type parameter.

       --description (string)
          An optional description to assign to the policy.

       --name (string)
          The friendly name to assign to the policy.

          The  regex  pattern  that  is  used  to validate this parameter is a
          string of any of the characters in the ASCII character range.

       --type (string)
          The type of policy to create. You can specify one of  the  following
          values:

          o AISERVICES_OPT_OUT_POLICY

          o BACKUP_POLICY

          o SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY

          o TAG_POLICY

          Possible values:

          o SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY

          o TAG_POLICY

          o BACKUP_POLICY

          o AISERVICES_OPT_OUT_POLICY

       --tags (list)
          A  list of tags that you want to attach to the newly created policy.
          For each tag in the list, you must specify both  a  tag  key  and  a
          value.  You  can set the value to an empty string, but you can't set
          it to null . For more information about  tagging,  see  Tagging  AWS
          Organizations resources in the AWS Organizations User Guide.

          NOTE:
              If  any  one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed
              number of tags for a policy, then the entire request  fails  and
              the policy is not created.

          (structure)
              A  custom  key-value pair associated with a resource within your
              organization.

              You can  attach  tags  to  any  of  the  following  organization
              resources.

              o AWS account

              o Organizational unit (OU)

              o Organization root

              o Policy

              Key -> (string)
                 The key identifier, or name, of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  string  value that's associated with the key of the tag.
                 You can set the value of a tag to an empty  string,  but  you
                 can't set the value of a tag to null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To create a policy with a text source file for the JSON pol-
       icy

       The following example shows you how to create an service control policy
       (SCP)  named  AllowAllS3Actions.  The  policy contents are taken from a
       file on the local computer called policy.json.

          aws organizations create-policy --content file://policy.json --name AllowAllS3Actions, --type SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY --description "Allows delegation of all S3 actions"

       The output includes a policy object with details about the new policy:

          {
                  "Policy": {
                          "Content": "{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Action\":[\"s3:*\"],\"Resource\":[\"*\"]}]}",
                          "PolicySummary": {
                                  "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::o-exampleorgid:policy/service_control_policy/p-examplepolicyid111",
                                  "Description": "Allows delegation of all S3 actions",
                                  "Name": "AllowAllS3Actions",
                                  "Type":"SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY"
                          }
                  }
          }

       Example 2: To create a policy with a JSON policy as a parameter

       The following example shows you how to create the same SCP,  this  time
       by embedding the policy contents as a JSON string in the parameter. The
       string must be escaped with backslashes before  the  double  quotes  to
       ensure that they are treated as literals in the parameter, which itself
       is surrounded by double quotes:

          aws organizations create-policy --content "{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Action\":[\"s3:*\"],\"Resource\":[\"*\"]}]}" --name AllowAllS3Actions --type SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY --description "Allows delegation of all S3 actions"

       zation,  see  Managing  Organization  Policies in the AWS Organizations
       User Guide.

OUTPUT
       Policy -> (structure)
          A structure that contains details about the newly created policy.

          PolicySummary -> (structure)
              A structure that contains additional details about the policy.

              Id -> (string)
                 The unique identifier (ID) of the policy.

                 The regex pattern for a policy ID string requires  "p-"  fol-
                 lowed  by  from 8 to 128 lowercase or uppercase letters, dig-
                 its, or the underscore character (_).

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy.

                 For more information about ARNs  in  Organizations,  see  ARN
                 Formats  Supported by Organizations in the AWS Service Autho-
                 rization Reference .

              Name -> (string)
                 The friendly name of the policy.

                 The regex pattern that is used to validate this parameter  is
                 a  string  of  any  of  the characters in the ASCII character
                 range.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the policy.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of policy.

              AwsManaged -> (boolean)
                 A boolean value that indicates whether the  specified  policy
                 is  an  AWS  managed policy. If true, then you can attach the
                 policy to roots, OUs, or accounts, but you cannot edit it.

          Content -> (string)
              The text content of the policy.
