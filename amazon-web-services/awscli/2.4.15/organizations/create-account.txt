CREATE-ACCOUNT()                                              CREATE-ACCOUNT()



NAME
       create-account -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an AWS account that is automatically a member of the organiza-
       tion whose credentials  made  the  request.  This  is  an  asynchronous
       request  that  AWS  performs  in  the background. Because CreateAccount
       operates asynchronously, it can return a successful completion  message
       even  though  account  initialization  might  still be in progress. You
       might need to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the
       account. To check the status of the request, do one of the following:

       o Use  the  Id  member of the CreateAccountStatus response element from
         this operation to provide as a parameter  to  the   DescribeCreateAc-
         countStatus operation.

       o Check  the  AWS CloudTrail log for the CreateAccountResult event. For
         information on using  AWS  CloudTrail  with  AWS  Organizations,  see
         Logging  and monitoring in AWS Organizations in the AWS Organizations
         User Guide.

       The user who calls the API to create an account must have the organiza-
       tions:CreateAccount  permission.  If  you  enabled  all features in the
       organization, AWS Organizations  creates  the  required  service-linked
       role  named  AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations . For more information, see
       AWS Organizations and Service-Linked Roles  in  the  AWS  Organizations
       User Guide .

       If  the request includes tags, then the requester must have the organi-
       zations:TagResource permission.

       AWS Organizations preconfigures the new  member  account  with  a  role
       (named  OrganizationAccountAccessRole  by default) that grants users in
       the management account administrator  permissions  in  the  new  member
       account.  Principals in the management account can assume the role. AWS
       Organizations clones the company name and address information  for  the
       new account from the organization's management account.

       This  operation  can  be called only from the organization's management
       account.

       For more information about  creating  accounts,  see  Creating  an  AWS
       Account in Your Organization in the AWS Organizations User Guide.

       WARNING:

          o When  you create an account in an organization using the AWS Orga-
            nizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information  required
            for the account to operate as a standalone account, such as a pay-
            ment method and signing the end user license agreement  (EULA)  is
            not  automatically  collected.  If you must remove an account from
            your organization later, you can do so only after you provide  the
            missing  information. Follow the steps at To leave an organization
            as a member account in the AWS Organizations User Guide .

          o If you get an exception that  indicates  that  you  exceeded  your
            account limits for the organization, contact AWS Support .

          o If  you  get an exception that indicates that the operation failed
            because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and
            then try again. If the error persists, contact AWS Support .

          o Using  CreateAccount  to  create multiple temporary accounts isn't
            recommended. You can only close an account from  the  Billing  and
            Cost  Management  Console,  and  you must be signed in as the root
            user. For information on the requirements and process for  closing
            an  account,  see  Closing an AWS Account in the AWS Organizations
            User Guide .

       NOTE:
          When you create a member account with this operation, you can choose
          whether  to  create the account with the IAM User and Role Access to
          Billing Information switch enabled. If you enable it, IAM users  and
          roles that have appropriate permissions can view billing information
          for the account. If you disable it, only the account root  user  can
          access  billing  information.  For  information about how to disable
          this switch for an account, see  Granting  Access  to  Your  Billing
          Information and Tools .

SYNOPSIS
            create-account
          --email <value>
          --account-name <value>
          [--role-name <value>]
          [--iam-user-access-to-billing <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --email (string)
          The  email address of the owner to assign to the new member account.
          This email address must not already be associated with  another  AWS
          account. You must use a valid email address to complete account cre-
          ation. You can't access the root user of the account  or  remove  an
          account that was created with an invalid email address.

       --account-name (string)
          The friendly name of the member account.

       --role-name (string)
          (Optional)

          The name of an IAM role that AWS Organizations automatically precon-
          figures in the new member account. This role trusts  the  management
          account,  allowing  users  in  the  management account to assume the
          role, as permitted by the management account administrator. The role
          has administrator permissions in the new member account.

          If you don't specify this parameter, the role name defaults to Orga-
          nizationAccountAccessRole .

          For more information about how to use this role to access the member
          account, see the following links:

            tion in the AWS Organizations User Guide

          o Steps 2 and 3 in Tutorial: Delegate  Access  Across  AWS  Accounts
            Using IAM Roles in the IAM User Guide

          The  regex pattern that is used to validate this parameter. The pat-
          tern can include uppercase letters, lowercase letters,  digits  with
          no spaces, and any of the following characters: =,.@-

       --iam-user-access-to-billing (string)
          If  set  to  ALLOW  ,  the  new  account enables IAM users to access
          account billing information if they have the  required  permissions.
          If  set  to  DENY , only the root user of the new account can access
          account billing information. For more  information,  see  Activating
          Access to the Billing and Cost Management Console in the AWS Billing
          and Cost Management User Guide .

          If you don't specify this parameter, the value defaults to  ALLOW  ,
          and  IAM  users  and  roles with the required permissions can access
          billing information for the new account.

          Possible values:

          o ALLOW

          o DENY

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags that you want to attach to the newly created account.
          For  each  tag  in  the  list, you must specify both a tag key and a
          value. You can set the value to an empty string, but you  can't  set
          it  to  null  .  For more information about tagging, see Tagging AWS
          Organizations resources in the AWS Organizations User Guide.

          NOTE:
              If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed  the  allowed
              number of tags for an account, then the entire request fails and
              the account is not created.

          (structure)
              A custom key-value pair associated with a resource  within  your
              organization.

              You  can  attach  tags  to  any  of  the  following organization
              resources.

              o AWS account

              o Organizational unit (OU)

              o Organization root

              o Policy

              Key -> (string)
                 The key identifier, or name, of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The string value that's associated with the key of  the  tag.
                 You  can  set  the value of a tag to an empty string, but you
                 can't set the value of a tag to null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a member account that is automatically part of the  organiza-
       tion

       The  following example shows how to create a member account in an orga-
       nization. The member account is configured  with  the  name  Production
       Account and the email address of susan@example.com. Organizations auto-
       matically creates an IAM role using the default name of OrganizationAc-
       countAccessRole  because the roleName parameter is not specified. Also,
       the setting that allows IAM users or roles with sufficient  permissions
       to  access  account  billing  data is set to the default value of ALLOW
       because the IamUserAccessToBilling parameter is not specified.  Organi-
       zations automatically sends Susan a "Welcome to AWS" email:

          aws organizations create-account --email susan@example.com --account-name "Production Account"

       The  output includes a request object that shows that the status is now
       IN_PROGRESS:

          {
                  "CreateAccountStatus": {
                          "State": "IN_PROGRESS",
                          "Id": "car-examplecreateaccountrequestid111"
                  }
          }

       You can later query the current status of the request by providing  the
       Id  response value to the describe-create-account-status command as the
       value for the create-account-request-id parameter.

       For more information, see Creating an AWS Account in Your  Organization
       in the AWS Organizations Users Guide.

OUTPUT
       CreateAccountStatus -> (structure)
          A  structure  that  contains  details about the request to create an
          account. This response structure might not be fully  populated  when
          you  first  receive  it  because account creation is an asynchronous
          process. You can pass  the  returned  CreateAccountStatus  ID  as  a
          parameter  to   DescribeCreateAccountStatus  to get status about the
          progress of the request at later times. You can also check  the  AWS
          CloudTrail  log for the CreateAccountResult event. For more informa-
          tion, see Monitoring the Activity in Your Organization  in  the  AWS
          Organizations User Guide .

          Id -> (string)
              The unique identifier (ID) that references this request. You get
              this value from  the  response  of  the  initial   CreateAccount
              request to create the account.

              The  regex  pattern  for  a  create  account  request  ID string
              requires "car-" followed by from 8 to 32  lowercase  letters  or
              digits.

          AccountName -> (string)
              The account name given to the account when it was created.

          State -> (string)
              The status of the asynchronous request to create an AWS account.

          RequestedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the request was made for the account cre-
              ation.

          CompletedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The  date  and time that the account was created and the request
              completed.

          AccountId -> (string)
              If the account was created successfully, the  unique  identifier
              (ID) of the new account.

              The  regex  pattern for an account ID string requires exactly 12
              digits.

          GovCloudAccountId -> (string)
              If the account was created successfully, the  unique  identifier
              (ID) of the new account in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region.

          FailureReason -> (string)
              If the request failed, a description of the reason for the fail-
              ure.

              o ACCOUNT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED:  The  account  couldn't   be   created
                because  you  reached  the  limit on the number of accounts in
                your organization.

              o CONCURRENT_ACCOUNT_MODIFICATION:  You  already   submitted   a
                request with the same information.

              o EMAIL_ALREADY_EXISTS: The account could not be created because
                another AWS account with that email address already exists.

              o FAILED_BUSINESS_VALIDATION: The AWS  account  that  owns  your
                organization failed to receive business license validation.

              o GOVCLOUD_ACCOUNT_ALREADY_EXISTS:  The  account in the AWS Gov-
                Cloud (US) Region could not be  created  because  this  Region
                already includes an account with that email address.

              o IDENTITY_INVALID_BUSINESS_VALIDATION:  The  AWS  account  that
                owns your organization can't complete business license valida-
                tion because it doesn't have valid identity data.

              o INVALID_ADDRESS:  The account could not be created because the
                address you provided is not valid.

              o INVALID_EMAIL: The account could not be  created  because  the
                email address you provided is not valid.

              o INTERNAL_FAILURE:  The account could not be created because of
                an internal failure. Try again later. If the problem persists,
                contact AWS Customer Support.

              o MISSING_BUSINESS_VALIDATION:  The  AWS  account that owns your
                organization has not received Business Validation.

              o MISSING_PAYMENT_INSTRUMENT: You must configure the  management
                account with a valid payment method, such as a credit card.

              o PENDING_BUSINESS_VALIDATION:  The  AWS  account that owns your
                organization is still in the process  of  completing  business
                license validation.

              o UNKNOWN_BUSINESS_VALIDATION:  The  AWS  account that owns your
                organization has an unknown issue with business license  vali-
                dation.
