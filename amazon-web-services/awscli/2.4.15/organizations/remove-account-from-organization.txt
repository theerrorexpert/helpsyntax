REMOVE-ACCOUNT-FROM-ORGANIZATION()          REMOVE-ACCOUNT-FROM-ORGANIZATION()



NAME
       remove-account-from-organization -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes the specified account from the organization.

       The removed account becomes a standalone account that isn't a member of
       any organization. It's no longer subject to any policies and is respon-
       sible  for its own bill payments. The organization's management account
       is no longer charged for any expenses accrued  by  the  member  account
       after it's removed from the organization.

       This  operation  can  be called only from the organization's management
       account. Member accounts can remove themselves with   LeaveOrganization
       instead.

       WARNING:

          o You  can  remove  an  account  from  your organization only if the
            account is configured with the information required to operate  as
            a  standalone  account. When you create an account in an organiza-
            tion using the AWS Organizations console, API,  or  CLI  commands,
            the  information  required of standalone accounts is not automati-
            cally collected. For an account that you want to make  standalone,
            you  must  choose  a support plan, provide and verify the required
            contact information, and provide a  current  payment  method.  AWS
            uses the payment method to charge for any billable (not free tier)
            AWS activity that occurs while the account isn't  attached  to  an
            organization.  To  remove  an  account  that doesn't yet have this
            information, you must sign in as the member account and follow the
            steps at To leave an organization when all required account infor-
            mation has not yet been provided in  the  AWS  Organizations  User
            Guide.

          o The  account that you want to leave must not be a delegated admin-
            istrator account for any AWS service enabled  for  your  organiza-
            tion.  If the account is a delegated administrator, you must first
            change the delegated administrator account to another account that
            is remaining in the organization.

          o After  the  account  leaves  the  organization, all tags that were
            attached to the account object in the  organization  are  deleted.
            AWS accounts outside of an organization do not support tags.

SYNOPSIS
            remove-account-from-organization
          --account-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier  (ID) of the member account that you want to
          remove from the organization.

          The regex pattern for an account ID string requires exactly 12  dig-
          its.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
