NAME
       update-organizational-unit -

DESCRIPTION
       Renames  the  specified  organizational unit (OU). The ID and ARN don't
       change. The child OUs and accounts remain in place,  and  any  attached
       policies of the OU remain attached.

       This  operation  can  be called only from the organization's management
       account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-organizational-unit
          --organizational-unit-id <value>
          [--name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --organizational-unit-id (string)
          The unique identifier (ID) of the OU that you want  to  rename.  You
          can get the ID from the  ListOrganizationalUnitsForParent operation.

          The regex pattern for an  organizational  unit  ID  string  requires
          "ou-"  followed  by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits (the ID
          of the root that contains the OU). This string is followed by a sec-
          ond  "-"  dash and from 8 to 32 additional lowercase letters or dig-
          its.

       --name (string)
          The new name that you want to assign to the OU.

          The regex pattern that is used  to  validate  this  parameter  is  a
          string of any of the characters in the ASCII character range.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To rename an OU

       This  example shows you how to rename an OU: In this example, the OU is
       renamed "AccountingOU":

          aws organizations update-organizational-unit --organizational-unit-id ou-examplerootid111-exampleouid111 --name AccountingOU

       The output shows the new name:

          {
                  "OrganizationalUnit": {
                          "Id": "ou-examplerootid111-exampleouid111"
                          "Name": "AccountingOU",
                          "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::111111111111:ou/o-exampleorgid/ou-examplerootid111-exampleouid111""
                  }
          }

OUTPUT
       OrganizationalUnit -> (structure)
          A structure that  contains  the  details  about  the  specified  OU,
          including its new name.

          Id -> (string)
              The unique identifier (ID) associated with this OU.

              The  regex pattern for an organizational unit ID string requires
              "ou-" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits  (the
              ID of the root that contains the OU). This string is followed by
              a second "-" dash and from 8 to 32 additional lowercase  letters
              or digits.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this OU.

              For  more  information about ARNs in Organizations, see ARN For-
              mats Supported by Organizations in the AWS Service Authorization
              Reference .

          Name -> (string)
              The friendly name of this OU.

              The  regex  pattern that is used to validate this parameter is a
              string of any of the characters in the ASCII character range.
