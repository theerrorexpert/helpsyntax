LIST-TARGETS-FOR-POLICY()                            LIST-TARGETS-FOR-POLICY()



NAME
       list-targets-for-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all the roots, organizational units (OUs), and accounts that the
       specified policy is attached to.

       NOTE:
          Always check the NextToken response parameter for a null value  when
          calling  a List* operation. These operations can occasionally return
          an empty set of results even when there are more results  available.
          The  NextToken response parameter value is null  only when there are
          no more results to display.

       This operation can be called only from  the  organization's  management
       account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an
       AWS service.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-targets-for-policy is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: Targets

SYNOPSIS
            list-targets-for-policy
          --policy-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --policy-id (string)
          The  unique identifier (ID) of the policy whose attachments you want
          to know.

          The regex pattern for a policy ID string requires "p-"  followed  by
          from  8 to 128 lowercase or uppercase letters, digits, or the under-
          score character (_).

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To  retrieve  a  list  of the roots, OUs, and accounts that a policy is
       attached to

       The following example shows how to get a list of the  roots,  OUs,  and
       accounts that the specified policy is attached to:

          aws organizations list-targets-for-policy --policy-id p-FullAWSAccess

       The  output includes a list of attachment objects with summary informa-
       tion about the roots, OUs, and accounts the policy is attached to:

          {
                  "Targets": [
                          {
                                  "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::111111111111:root/o-exampleorgid/r-examplerootid111",
                                  "Name": "Root",
                                  "TargetId":"r-examplerootid111",
                                  "Type":"ROOT"
                          },
                          {
                                  "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::111111111111:account/o-exampleorgid/333333333333;",
                                  "Name": "Developer Test Account",
                                  "TargetId": "333333333333",
                                  "Type": "ACCOUNT"
                          },
                          {
                                  "Arn":"arn:aws:organizations::111111111111:ou/o-exampleorgid/ou-examplerootid111-exampleouid111",
                                  "Name":"Accounting",
                                  "TargetId":"ou-examplerootid111-exampleouid111",
                                  "Type":"ORGANIZATIONAL_UNIT"
                          }
                  ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Targets -> (list)
          A list of structures, each of which contains details  about  one  of
          the entities to which the specified policy is attached.

          (structure)
              Contains  information about a root, OU, or account that a policy
              is attached to.

              TargetId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier (ID) of the policy target.

                 The regex pattern for a target ID string requires one of  the
                 following:

                 o Root - A string that begins with "r-" followed by from 4 to
                   32 lowercase letters or digits.

                 o Account - A string that consists of exactly 12 digits.

                 o Organizational unit (OU) - A string that begins with  "ou-"
                   followed  by  from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits (the
                   ID of the root that the OU is in). This string is  followed
                   by  a second "-" dash and from 8 to 32 additional lowercase
                   letters or digits.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy target.

                 For more information about ARNs  in  Organizations,  see  ARN
                 Formats  Supported by Organizations in the AWS Service Autho-
                 rization Reference .

              Name -> (string)
                 The friendly name of the policy target.

                 The regex pattern that is used to validate this parameter  is
                 a  string  of  any  of  the characters in the ASCII character
                 range.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of the policy target.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If present, indicates that more output is available than is included
          in  the  current  response.  Use this value in the NextToken request
          parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to get the next part
          of  the  output. You should repeat this until the NextToken response
          element comes back as null .
