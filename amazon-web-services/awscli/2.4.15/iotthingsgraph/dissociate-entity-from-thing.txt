DISSOCIATE-ENTITY-FROM-THING()                  DISSOCIATE-ENTITY-FROM-THING()



NAME
       dissociate-entity-from-thing -

DESCRIPTION
       Dissociates  a  device  entity  from a concrete thing. The action takes
       only the type of the entity that you need to  dissociate  because  only
       one entity of a particular type can be associated with a thing.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            dissociate-entity-from-thing
          --thing-name <value>
          --entity-type <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --thing-name (string)
          The name of the thing to disassociate.

       --entity-type (string)
          The entity type from which to disassociate the thing.

          Possible values:

          o DEVICE

          o SERVICE

          o DEVICE_MODEL

          o CAPABILITY

          o STATE

          o ACTION

          o EVENT

          o PROPERTY

          o MAPPING

          o ENUM

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To dissociate a thing from a device

       The  following dissociate-entity-from-thing example dissociates a thing
       from a device.

              --thing-name "MotionSensorName" \
              --entity-type "DEVICE"

       This command produces no output.
