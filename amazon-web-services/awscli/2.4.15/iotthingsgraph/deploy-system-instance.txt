DEPLOY-SYSTEM-INSTANCE()                              DEPLOY-SYSTEM-INSTANCE()



NAME
       deploy-system-instance -

DESCRIPTION
          Greengrass and Cloud Deployments

       Deploys  the  system  instance  to  the  target specified in CreateSys-
       temInstance .
          Greengrass Deployments

       If the system or any workflows and entities have  been  updated  before
       this  action  is  called,  then the deployment will create a new Amazon
       Simple Storage Service resource file and then deploy it.

       Since this action creates  a  Greengrass  deployment  on  the  caller's
       behalf,  the calling identity must have write permissions to the speci-
       fied Greengrass group. Otherwise, the call will fail with an authoriza-
       tion error.

       For  information  about the artifacts that get added to your Greengrass
       core device when you use this API, see AWS IoT Things Graph and AWS IoT
       Greengrass .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            deploy-system-instance
          [--id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The  ID  of  the system instance. This value is returned by the Cre-
          ateSystemInstance action.

          The ID should be in the following format.
              urn:tdm:REGION/ACCOUNT ID/default:deployment:DEPLOYMENTNAME

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To deploy a system instance

       The following delete-system-template example deploys a system instance.

          aws iotthingsgraph deploy-system-instance \
              --id "urn:tdm:us-west-2/123456789012/default:Deployment:Room218"

       Output:

          {
             "summary": {
                "arn": "arn:aws:iotthingsgraph:us-west-2:123456789012:Deployment:Room218",
                "createdAt": 1559249776.254,
                "id": "urn:tdm:us-west-2/123456789012/default:Deployment:Room218",
                "status": "DEPLOYED_IN_TARGET",
                "target": "CLOUD",
                "updatedAt": 1559249776.254
             }
          }
