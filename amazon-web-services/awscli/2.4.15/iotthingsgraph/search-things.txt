SEARCH-THINGS()                                                SEARCH-THINGS()



NAME
       search-things -

DESCRIPTION
       Searches  for  things  associated  with  the  specified entity. You can
       search by both device and device model.

       For example, if two different devices, camera1 and  camera2,  implement
       the  camera  device model, the user can associate thing1 to camera1 and
       thing2 to camera2. SearchThings(camera2) will return only  thing2,  but
       SearchThings(camera) will return both thing1 and thing2.

       This action searches for exact matches and doesn't perform partial text
       matching.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       search-things is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: things

SYNOPSIS
            search-things
          --entity-id <value>
          [--namespace-version <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --entity-id (string)
          The ID of the entity to which the things are associated.

          The IDs should be in the following format.
              urn:tdm:REGION/ACCOUNT ID/default:device:DEVICENAME

       --namespace-version (long)
          The  version of the user's namespace. Defaults to the latest version
          of the user's namespace.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To search for things associated with devices and device models

       The  following  search-things  example searches for all things that are
       associated with the HCSR501MotionSensor device.

          aws iotthingsgraph search-things \
              --entity-id "urn:tdm:aws/examples:Device:HCSR501MotionSensor"

       Output:

          {
              "things": [
                  {
                      "thingArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:thing/MotionSensor1",
                      "thingName": "MotionSensor1"
                  },
                  {
                      "thingArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:thing/TG_MS",
                      "thingName": "TG_MS"
                  }
              ]
          }
