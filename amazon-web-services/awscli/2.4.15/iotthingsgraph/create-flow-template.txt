CREATE-FLOW-TEMPLATE()                                  CREATE-FLOW-TEMPLATE()



NAME
       create-flow-template -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  workflow  template.  Workflows  can  be created only in the
       user's namespace. (The public namespace contains  only  entities.)  The
       workflow  can  contain  only  entities  in the specified namespace. The
       workflow is validated against the entities in the latest version of the
       user's  namespace  unless another namespace version is specified in the
       request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-flow-template
          --definition <value>
          [--compatible-namespace-version <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --definition (structure)
          The workflow DefinitionDocument .

          language -> (string)
              The language used to define the  entity.  GRAPHQL  is  the  only
              valid value.

          text -> (string)
              The GraphQL text that defines the entity.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          language=string,text=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "language": "GRAPHQL",
            "text": "string"
          }

       --compatible-namespace-version (long)
          The namespace version in which the workflow is to be created.

          If no value is specified, the latest version is used by default.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a flow

       The  following  create-flow-template example creates a flow (workflow).
       The value of MyFlowDefinition is the GraphQL that models the flow.

          aws iotthingsgraph create-flow-template \
              --definition language=GRAPHQL,text="MyFlowDefinition"

       Output:

          {
              "summary": {
                  "createdAt": 1559248067.545,
                  "id": "urn:tdm:us-west-2/123456789012/default:Workflow:MyFlow",
                  "revisionNumber": 1
              }
          }

       Graph User Guide.

OUTPUT
       summary -> (structure)
          The summary object that describes the created workflow.

          id -> (string)
              The ID of the workflow.

          arn -> (string)
              The ARN of the workflow.

          revisionNumber -> (long)
              The revision number of the workflow.

          createdAt -> (timestamp)
              The date when the workflow was created.
