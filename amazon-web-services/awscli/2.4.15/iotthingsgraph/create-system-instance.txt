CREATE-SYSTEM-INSTANCE()                              CREATE-SYSTEM-INSTANCE()



NAME
       create-system-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a system instance.

       This  action  validates  the  system  instance,  prepares  the  deploy-
       ment-related resources. For  Greengrass  deployments,  it  updates  the
       Greengrass  group  that is specified by the greengrassGroupName parame-
       ter. It also adds a file to the S3 bucket specified by the s3BucketName
       parameter.  You  need  to  call DeploySystemInstance after running this
       action.

       For  Greengrass  deployments,  since  this  action  modifies  and  adds
       resources  to  a  Greengrass  group  and  an  S3 bucket on the caller's
       behalf, the calling identity must have write permissions  to  both  the
       specified Greengrass group and S3 bucket. Otherwise, the call will fail
       with an authorization error.

       For cloud deployments, this action requires a flowActionsRoleArn value.
       This  is  an IAM role that has permissions to access AWS services, such
       as AWS Lambda and AWS IoT, that the flow uses when it executes.

       If the definition document doesn't specify  a  version  of  the  user's
       namespace, the latest version will be used by default.

OPTIONS
       --tags (list)

          rize your system instances.

          (structure)
              Metadata assigned to an AWS IoT Things Graph resource consisting
              of a key-value pair.

                 The optional value of the tag. The string value can be from 1
                 to 256 Unicode characters in length.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --definition (structure)
          A document that defines an entity.

          language -> (string)
              The  language  used  to  define  the entity. GRAPHQL is the only
              valid value.

          text -> (string)
              The GraphQL text that defines the entity.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          language=string,text=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "language": "GRAPHQL",
            "text": "string"
          }

       --target (string)
          The target type of the deployment. Valid values are  GREENGRASS  and
          CLOUD .

          Possible values:

          o GREENGRASS

          o CLOUD

       --greengrass-group-name (string)
          The  name  of the Greengrass group where the system instance will be
          deployed. This value is required if the value of the target  parame-
          ter is GREENGRASS .

       --s3-bucket-name (string)
          The  name  of  the Amazon Simple Storage Service bucket that will be
          used to store and deploy the system instance's resource  file.  This
          value is required if the value of the target parameter is GREENGRASS
          .

       --metrics-configuration (structure)
          An object that specifies whether cloud metrics are  collected  in  a
          deployment and, if so, what role is used to collect metrics.

          cloudMetricEnabled -> (boolean)
              A Boolean that specifies whether cloud metrics are collected.

          metricRuleRoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the role that is used to collect cloud metrics.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          cloudMetricEnabled=boolean,metricRuleRoleArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "cloudMetricEnabled": true|false,
            "metricRuleRoleArn": "string"
          }

       --flow-actions-role-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of the IAM role that AWS IoT Things Graph will assume when
          it executes the flow. This role must have read and write  access  to
          AWS Lambda and AWS IoT and any other AWS services that the flow uses
          when it executes. This value is required if the value of the  target
          parameter is CLOUD .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a system instance

       The following create-system-instance example creates a system instance.
       The value of MySystemInstanceDefinition is the GraphQL that models  the
       system instance.

          aws iotthingsgraph create-system-instance -\
              -definition language=GRAPHQL,text="MySystemInstanceDefinition" \
              --target CLOUD \
              --flow-actions-role-arn myRoleARN

       Output:

          {
              "summary": {
                  "id": "urn:tdm:us-west-2/123456789012/default:Deployment:Room218",
                  "arn": "arn:aws:iotthingsgraph:us-west-2:123456789012:Deployment/default/Room218",
