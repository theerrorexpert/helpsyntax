GET-SYSTEM-INSTANCE()                                    GET-SYSTEM-INSTANCE()



NAME
       get-system-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a system instance.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-system-instance
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The  ID of the system deployment instance. This value is returned by
          CreateSystemInstance .

          The ID should be in the following format.
              urn:tdm:REGION/ACCOUNT ID/default:deployment:DEPLOYMENTNAME

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get a system instance

       The following get-system-instance example gets a definition for a  sys-
       tem instance.

          aws iotthingsgraph get-system-instance \
              --id "urn:tdm:us-west-2/123456789012/default:Deployment:Room218"
