LIST-FLOW-EXECUTION-MESSAGES()                  LIST-FLOW-EXECUTION-MESSAGES()



NAME
       list-flow-execution-messages -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of objects that contain information about events in a
       flow execution.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-flow-execution-messages is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: messages

SYNOPSIS
            list-flow-execution-messages
          --flow-execution-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --flow-execution-id (string)
          The ID of the flow execution.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about events in a flow execution

       The following  list-flow-execution-messages  example  gets  information
       about events in a flow execution.

          aws iotthingsgraph list-flow-execution-messages \
              --flow-execution-id "urn:tdm:us-west-2/123456789012/default:Workflow:SecurityFlow_2019-05-11T19:39:55.317Z_MotionSensor_69b151ad-a611-42f5-ac21-fe537f9868ad"

       Output:

          {
              "messages": [
                  {
                   "eventType": "EXECUTION_STARTED",
                   "messageId": "f6294f1e-b109-4bbe-9073-f451a2dda2da",
                   "payload": "Flow execution started",
                   "timestamp": 1559247540.656
                  }
              ]
          }
