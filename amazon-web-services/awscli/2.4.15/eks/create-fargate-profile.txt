CREATE-FARGATE-PROFILE()                              CREATE-FARGATE-PROFILE()



NAME
       create-fargate-profile -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  Fargate profile for your Amazon EKS cluster. You must have
       at least one Fargate profile in a cluster to be able  to  run  pods  on
       Fargate.

       The  Fargate  profile allows an administrator to declare which pods run
       on Fargate and specify which pods run on which  Fargate  profile.  This
       declaration  is  done  through the profiles selectors. Each profile can
       have up to five selectors that contain a namespace and labels. A names-
       pace is required for every selector. The label field consists of multi-
       ple optional key-value pairs. Pods that match the selectors are  sched-
       uled  on Fargate. If a to-be-scheduled pod matches any of the selectors
       in the Fargate profile, then that pod is run on Fargate.

       When you create a Fargate profile, you must  specify  a  pod  execution
       role  to  use  with  the pods that are scheduled with the profile. This
       role is added to the cluster's Kubernetes  Role  Based  Access  Control
       (RBAC)  for  authorization  so  that the kubelet that is running on the
       Fargate infrastructure can register with your  Amazon  EKS  cluster  so
       that  it  can  appear in your cluster as a node. The pod execution role
       also provides IAM permissions to the Fargate  infrastructure  to  allow
       read access to Amazon ECR image repositories. For more information, see
       Pod Execution Role in the Amazon EKS User Guide .

       Fargate profiles are immutable. However, you can create a  new  updated
       profile  to  replace  an  existing profile and then delete the original
       after the updated profile has finished creating.

       If any Fargate profiles in a cluster are in the  DELETING  status,  you
       must  wait  for  that Fargate profile to finish deleting before you can
       create any other profiles in that cluster.

       For more information, see Fargate Profile in the Amazon EKS User  Guide
       .

SYNOPSIS
            create-fargate-profile
          --fargate-profile-name <value>
          --cluster-name <value>
          --pod-execution-role-arn <value>
          [--subnets <value>]
          [--selectors <value>]
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fargate-profile-name (string)
          The name of the Fargate profile.

       --cluster-name (string)
          The  name of the Amazon EKS cluster to apply the Fargate profile to.

       --pod-execution-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the pod execution role to use  for
          pods that match the selectors in the Fargate profile. The pod execu-
          tion role allows Fargate infrastructure to register with your  clus-
          ter  as  a  node,  and  it  provides read access to Amazon ECR image
          repositories. For more information, see Pod Execution  Role  in  the
          Amazon EKS User Guide .

       --subnets (list)
          The IDs of subnets to launch your pods into. At this time, pods run-
          ning on Fargate are not assigned public IP addresses, so  only  pri-
          vate  subnets  (with  no  direct  route  to an Internet Gateway) are
          accepted for this parameter.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --selectors (list)
          The selectors to match for pods to use this  Fargate  profile.  Each
          selector must have an associated namespace. Optionally, you can also
          specify labels for a namespace. You may specify up to five selectors
          in a Fargate profile.

          (structure)
              An object representing an Fargate profile selector.

              namespace -> (string)
                 The Kubernetes namespace that the selector should match.

              labels -> (map)
                 The  Kubernetes  labels that the selector should match. A pod
                 must contain all of the labels  that  are  specified  in  the
                 selector for it to be considered a match.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          namespace=string,labels={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "namespace": "string",
              "labels": {"string": "string"
                ...}
            }
            ...
          ]

       --client-request-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive  identifier  that  you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request.

       --tags (map)
          The metadata to apply to the Fargate profile to assist with  catego-
          rization  and  organization.  Each  tag  consists  of  a  key and an
          optional value. You define both. Fargate profile tags do not  propa-
          gate  to  any  other  resources associated with the Fargate profile,
          such as the pods that are scheduled with it.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
