CREATE-ADDON()                                                  CREATE-ADDON()



NAME
       create-addon -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an Amazon EKS add-on.

       Amazon EKS add-ons help to automate the provisioning and lifecycle man-
       agement of common operational software for Amazon EKS clusters.  Amazon
       EKS add-ons require clusters running version 1.18 or later because Ama-
       zon EKS add-ons rely on the Server-side Apply Kubernetes feature, which
       is  only  available in Kubernetes 1.18 and later. For more information,
       see Amazon EKS add-ons in the Amazon EKS User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-addon
          --cluster-name <value>
          --addon-name <value>
          [--addon-version <value>]
          [--service-account-role-arn <value>]
          [--resolve-conflicts <value>]
          [--client-request-token <value>]

          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The name of the cluster to create the add-on for.

       --addon-name (string)
          The name of the add-on.  The  name  must  match  one  of  the  names
          returned            by            `            DescribeAddonVersions
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAddonVersions.html`__
          .

       --addon-version (string)
          The  version  of  the add-on. The version must match one of the ver-
          sions       returned        by        `        DescribeAddonVersions
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAddonVersions.html`__
          .

       --service-account-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an existing IAM role  to  bind  to
          the add-on's service account. The role must be assigned the IAM per-
          missions required by the add-on. If you don't  specify  an  existing
          IAM  role, then the add-on uses the permissions assigned to the node
          IAM role. For more information, see Amazon EKS node IAM role in  the
          Amazon EKS User Guide .

          NOTE:
              To  specify  an  existing  IAM role, you must have an IAM OpenID
              Connect (OIDC) provider  created  for  your  cluster.  For  more
              information, see Enabling IAM roles for service accounts on your
              cluster in the Amazon EKS User Guide .

       --resolve-conflicts (string)
          How to resolve parameter value conflicts when migrating an  existing
          add-on to an Amazon EKS add-on.

          Possible values:

          o OVERWRITE

          o NONE

       --client-request-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request.

       --tags (map)
          The metadata to apply to the cluster to assist  with  categorization
          and  organization. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value.
          You define both.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
