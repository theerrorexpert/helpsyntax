NAME
       describe-identity-provider-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  descriptive  information about an identity provider configura-
       tion.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-identity-provider-config
          --cluster-name <value>
          --identity-provider-config <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The cluster name that the identity provider configuration is associ-
          ated to.

       --identity-provider-config (structure)
          An object that represents an identity provider configuration.

          type -> (string)
              The type of the identity provider configuration.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the identity provider configuration.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          type=string,name=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "type": "string",
            "name": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       identityProviderConfig -> (structure)
          The  object  that  represents  an  OpenID  Connect  (OIDC)  identity
          provider configuration.

          oidc -> (structure)
              An object that represents  an  OpenID  Connect  (OIDC)  identity
              provider configuration.

              identityProviderConfigName -> (string)
                 The name of the configuration.

              identityProviderConfigArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the configuration.

              clusterName -> (string)
                 The cluster that the configuration is associated to.

              issuerUrl -> (string)
                 The  URL  of  the  OIDC identity provider that allows the API
                 server to discover public signing keys for verifying  tokens.

              clientId -> (string)
                 This  is also known as audience . The ID of the client appli-
                 cation that makes authentication requests to the  OIDC  iden-
                 tity provider.

              usernameClaim -> (string)
                 The  JSON Web token (JWT) claim that is used as the username.

              usernamePrefix -> (string)
                 The prefix that is prepended to username  claims  to  prevent
                 clashes with existing names. The prefix can't contain system:

              groupsClaim -> (string)
                 The JSON web token (JWT) claim  that  the  provider  uses  to
                 return your groups.

              groupsPrefix -> (string)
                 The  prefix  that  is  prepended  to  group claims to prevent
                 clashes with existing names (such  as  system:  groups).  For
                 example,   the   value``oidc:``   creates  group  names  like
                 oidc:engineering and oidc:infra . The  prefix  can't  contain
                 system:

              requiredClaims -> (map)
                 The  key-value  pairs  that  describe  required claims in the
                 identity token. If set, each claim is verified to be  present
                 in the token with a matching value.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              tags -> (map)
                 The metadata to apply to the provider configuration to assist
                 with categorization and organization. Each tag consists of  a
                 key and an optional value. You define both.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the OIDC identity provider.
