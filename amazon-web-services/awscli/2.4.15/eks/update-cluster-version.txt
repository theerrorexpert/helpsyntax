UPDATE-CLUSTER-VERSION()                              UPDATE-CLUSTER-VERSION()



NAME
       update-cluster-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates an Amazon EKS cluster to the specified Kubernetes version. Your
       cluster continues to function during the update.  The  response  output
       includes  an  update  ID  that  you can use to track the status of your
       cluster update with the  DescribeUpdate API operation.

       Cluster updates are asynchronous, and they should finish within  a  few
       minutes.  During  an update, the cluster status moves to UPDATING (this
       status transition is eventually consistent). When the  update  is  com-
       plete  (either  Failed  or  Successful  ),  the cluster status moves to
       Active .

       If your cluster has managed node groups attached to  it,  all  of  your
       node groups Kubernetes versions must match the clusters Kubernetes ver-
       sion in order to update the cluster to a new Kubernetes version.

SYNOPSIS
            update-cluster-version
          --name <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          --kubernetes-version <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the Amazon EKS cluster to update.

       --client-request-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you  provide  to  ensure  the
          idempotency of the request.

       --kubernetes-version (string)
          The desired Kubernetes version following a successful update.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
