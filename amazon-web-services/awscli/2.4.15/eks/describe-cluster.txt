DESCRIBE-CLUSTER()                                          DESCRIBE-CLUSTER()



NAME
       describe-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns descriptive information about an Amazon EKS cluster.

       The API server endpoint and certificate authority data returned by this
       operation are required for kubelet and kubectl to communicate with your
       Kubernetes  API  server.  For more information, see Create a kubeconfig
       for Amazon EKS .

       NOTE:
          The API server endpoint and certificate authority data aren't avail-
          able until the cluster reaches the ACTIVE state.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-cluster
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the cluster to describe.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster.

          createdAt -> (timestamp)
              The Unix epoch timestamp in seconds for  when  the  cluster  was
              created.

          version -> (string)
              The Kubernetes server version for the cluster.

              The endpoint for your Kubernetes API server.

          roleArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the IAM role that provides
              permissions for the Kubernetes control plane to  make  calls  to
              Amazon Web Services API operations on your behalf.

          resourcesVpcConfig -> (structure)
              The  VPC configuration used by the cluster control plane. Amazon
              EKS VPC resources have specific requirements  to  work  properly
              with Kubernetes. For more information, see Cluster VPC Consider-
              ations and Cluster Security Group Considerations in  the  Amazon
              EKS User Guide .

              subnetIds -> (list)
                 The subnets associated with your cluster.

                 (string)

              securityGroupIds -> (list)
                 The security groups associated with the cross-account elastic
                 network interfaces  that  are  used  to  allow  communication
                 between your nodes and the Kubernetes control plane.

                 (string)

              clusterSecurityGroupId -> (string)
                 The cluster security group that was created by Amazon EKS for
                 the cluster. Managed node groups use this security group  for
                 control-plane-to-data-plane communication.

              vpcId -> (string)
                 The VPC associated with your cluster.

              endpointPublicAccess -> (boolean)
                 This  parameter  indicates  whether the Amazon EKS public API
                 server endpoint is enabled. If  the  Amazon  EKS  public  API
                 server  endpoint  is  disabled, your cluster's Kubernetes API
                 server can only receive requests that originate  from  within
                 the cluster VPC.

              endpointPrivateAccess -> (boolean)
                 This  parameter  indicates whether the Amazon EKS private API
                 server endpoint is enabled. If the  Amazon  EKS  private  API
                 server  endpoint  is  enabled,  Kubernetes  API requests that
                 originate from within your cluster's VPC use the private  VPC
                 endpoint instead of traversing the internet. If this value is
                 disabled and you have nodes or Fargate pods in  the  cluster,
                 then  ensure  that  publicAccessCidrs  includes the necessary
                 CIDR blocks for communication with the nodes or Fargate pods.
                 For  more information, see Amazon EKS cluster endpoint access
                 control in the * Amazon EKS User Guide * .

              publicAccessCidrs -> (list)
                 The CIDR blocks that are allowed  access  to  your  cluster's
                 public  Kubernetes  API server endpoint. Communication to the
                 endpoint from addresses outside of the listed CIDR blocks  is
                 denied.  The  default value is 0.0.0.0/0 . If you've disabled
                 private endpoint access and you have nodes or Fargate pods in
                 the  cluster,  then ensure that the necessary CIDR blocks are
                 listed. For more information, see Amazon EKS cluster endpoint
                 access control in the * Amazon EKS User Guide * .

                 (string)

          kubernetesNetworkConfig -> (structure)
              The Kubernetes network configuration for the cluster.

              serviceIpv4Cidr -> (string)
                 The  CIDR  block that Kubernetes Pod and Service IP addresses
                 are assigned from. Kubernetes assigns addresses from an  IPv4
                 CIDR  block  assigned to a subnet that the node is in. If you
                 didn't specify a CIDR block when  you  created  the  cluster,
                 then   Kubernetes   assigns   addresses   from   either   the
                 10.100.0.0/16 or 172.20.0.0/16 CIDR blocks. If this was spec-
                 ified, then it was specified when the cluster was created and
                 it can't be changed.

              serviceIpv6Cidr -> (string)
                 The CIDR block that Kubernetes Pod and Service  IP  addresses
                 are assigned from if you created a 1.21 or later cluster with
                 version 1.10.0 or later of the  Amazon  VPC  CNI  add-on  and
                 specified  ipv6  for  ipFamily  when you created the cluster.
                 Kubernetes assigns addresses from the  unique  local  address
                 range (fc00::/7).

              ipFamily -> (string)
                 The  IP  family  used to assign Kubernetes Pod and Service IP
                 addresses. The IP family is always ipv4 , unless you  have  a
                 1.21  or later cluster running version 1.10.0 or later of the
                 Amazon VPC CNI add-on and specified ipv6 when you created the
                 cluster.

              The logging configuration for your cluster.

              clusterLogging -> (list)
                 The  cluster  control  plane  logging  configuration for your
                 cluster.

                 (structure)
                     An object representing the enabled or disabled Kubernetes
                     control plane logs for your cluster.

                     types -> (list)
                        The available cluster control plane log types.

                        (string)

                     enabled -> (boolean)
                        If  a  log  type is enabled, that log type exports its
                        control plane logs to CloudWatch Logs. If a  log  type
                        isn't  enabled,  that log type doesn't export its con-
                        trol plane logs.  Each  individual  log  type  can  be
                        enabled or disabled independently.

          certificateAuthority -> (structure)
              The certificate-authority-data for your cluster.

              data -> (string)
                 The Base64-encoded certificate data required  to  communicate
                 with your cluster. Add this to the certificate-authority-data
                 section of the kubeconfig file for your cluster.

          clientRequestToken -> (string)
              Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
              idempotency of the request.

          platformVersion -> (string)
              The platform version of your Amazon EKS cluster. For more infor-
              mation, see Platform Versions in the * Amazon EKS User Guide * .

          tags -> (map)
              The  metadata that you apply to the cluster to assist with cate-
              gorization and organization. Each tag consists of a key  and  an
              optional  value.  You define both. Cluster tags do not propagate
              to any other resources associated with the cluster.

                 resources -> (list)
                     Specifies the resources to be encrypted.  The  only  sup-
                     ported value is "secrets".

                     (string)

                 provider -> (structure)
                     Key  Management  Service (KMS) key. Either the ARN or the

                        Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or alias of  the  KMS  key.
                        The  KMS  key  must  be symmetric, created in the same
                        region as the cluster, and if the KMS key was  created
                        in  a  different account, the user must have access to
                        the KMS key. For more information, see Allowing  Users
