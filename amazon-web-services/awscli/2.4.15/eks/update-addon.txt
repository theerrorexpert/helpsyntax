          --cluster-name <value>
          --addon-name <value>
          [--addon-version <value>]
          [--service-account-role-arn <value>]
          [--resolve-conflicts <value>]
          [--client-request-token <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The name of the cluster.

       --addon-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  add-on.  The  name  must  match one of the names
          returned               by                `                ListAddons
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/APIReference/API_ListAddons.html`__
          .

       --addon-version (string)
          The version of the add-on. The version must match one  of  the  ver-
          sions        returned        by        `       DescribeAddonVersions
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAddonVersions.html`__
          .

       --service-account-role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of an existing IAM role to bind to
          the add-on's service account. The role must be assigned the IAM per-
          missions  required  by  the add-on. If you don't specify an existing
          IAM role, then the add-on uses the permissions assigned to the  node
          IAM  role. For more information, see Amazon EKS node IAM role in the
          Amazon EKS User Guide .

          NOTE:
              To specify an existing IAM role, you must  have  an  IAM  OpenID
              Connect  (OIDC)  provider  created  for  your  cluster. For more
              information, see Enabling IAM roles for service accounts on your
              cluster in the Amazon EKS User Guide .

       --resolve-conflicts (string)
          How  to resolve parameter value conflicts when applying the new ver-
          sion of the add-on to the cluster.

          Possible values:

          o OVERWRITE

          o NONE

       --client-request-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you  provide  to  ensure  the
          idempotency of the request.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
