NAME
       create-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an Amazon EKS control plane.

       The  Amazon  EKS control plane consists of control plane instances that
       run the Kubernetes software, such as etcd and the API server. The  con-
       trol  plane  runs in an account managed by Amazon Web Services, and the
       Kubernetes API is exposed by the Amazon EKS API server  endpoint.  Each
       Amazon  EKS  cluster control plane is single tenant and unique. It runs
       on its own set of Amazon EC2 instances.

       The cluster control plane is provisioned across  multiple  Availability
       Zones  and  fronted by an Elastic Load Balancing Network Load Balancer.
       Amazon EKS also provisions elastic network interfaces in your VPC  sub-
       nets  to  provide  connectivity from the control plane instances to the
       nodes (for example, to support kubectl exec , logs  ,  and  proxy  data
       flows).

       Amazon EKS nodes run in your Amazon Web Services account and connect to
       your cluster's control plane over the Kubernetes  API  server  endpoint
       and a certificate file that is created for your cluster.

       In  most cases, it takes several minutes to create a cluster. After you
       create an Amazon EKS cluster, you must configure your Kubernetes  tool-
       ing to communicate with the API server and launch nodes into your clus-
       ter. For more information,  see  Managing  Cluster  Authentication  and
       Launching Amazon EKS nodes in the Amazon EKS User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            create-cluster
          --name <value>
          --role-arn <value>
          --resources-vpc-config <value>
          [--kubernetes-network-config <value>]
          [--logging <value>]
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--encryption-config <value>]
          [--kubernetes-version <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The unique name to give to your cluster.

       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that provides permis-
          sions for the Kubernetes control plane to make calls to  Amazon  Web
          Services  API  operations  on your behalf. For more information, see
          Amazon EKS Service IAM Role in the * Amazon EKS User Guide * .

       --resources-vpc-config (structure)
          The VPC configuration that's used by the cluster control plane. Ama-
          zon  EKS  VPC  resources have specific requirements to work properly
          with Kubernetes. For more information, see  Cluster  VPC  Considera-
          tions  and  Cluster  Security Group Considerations in the Amazon EKS
          User Guide . You must specify at least two subnets. You can  specify
          up  to  five  security  groups. However, we recommend that you use a
          dedicated security group for your cluster control plane.

          subnetIds -> (list)
              Specify subnets for your Amazon EKS nodes.  Amazon  EKS  creates
              cross-account  elastic  network  interfaces  in these subnets to
              allow communication between your nodes and the  Kubernetes  con-
              trol plane.

              (string)

          securityGroupIds -> (list)
              Specify  one or more security groups for the cross-account elas-
              tic network interfaces that Amazon EKS creates to use that allow
              communication  between  your  nodes  and  the Kubernetes control
              plane. If you don't specify any security groups, then  familiar-
              ize yourself with the difference between Amazon EKS defaults for
              clusters deployed with Kubernetes:

              o 1.14 Amazon EKS platform version eks.2 and earlier

              o 1.14 Amazon EKS platform version eks.3 and later

              For more information, see Amazon EKS security  group  considera-
              tions in the * Amazon EKS User Guide * .

              (string)

          endpointPublicAccess -> (boolean)
              Set  this  value to false to disable public access to your clus-
              ter's Kubernetes API server  endpoint.  If  you  disable  public
              access,  your  cluster's  Kubernetes API server can only receive
              requests from within the cluster VPC. The default value for this
              parameter  is true , which enables public access for your Kuber-
              netes API server. For more information, see Amazon  EKS  cluster
              endpoint access control in the * Amazon EKS User Guide * .

          endpointPrivateAccess -> (boolean)
              Set  this  value to true to enable private access for your clus-
              ter's Kubernetes API server  endpoint.  If  you  enable  private
              access,  Kubernetes  API requests from within your cluster's VPC
              use the private VPC endpoint. The default value for this parame-
              ter is false , which disables private access for your Kubernetes
              API server. If you disable private access and you have nodes  or
              Fargate  pods in the cluster, then ensure that publicAccessCidrs
              includes the necessary CIDR blocks for  communication  with  the
              nodes  or  Fargate  pods.  For  more information, see Amazon EKS
              cluster endpoint access control in the * Amazon EKS User Guide *
              .

          publicAccessCidrs -> (list)
              The CIDR blocks that are allowed access to your cluster's public
              Kubernetes API server endpoint. Communication  to  the  endpoint
              from  addresses  outside  of the CIDR blocks that you specify is
              denied. The default value is 0.0.0.0/0 . If you've disabled pri-
              vate  endpoint  access and you have nodes or Fargate pods in the
              cluster, then ensure that you specify the necessary CIDR blocks.
              For  more  information,  see  Amazon EKS cluster endpoint access
              control in the * Amazon EKS User Guide * .

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          subnetIds=string,string,securityGroupIds=string,string,endpointPublicAccess=boolean,endpointPrivateAccess=boolean,publicAccessCidrs=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "subnetIds": ["string", ...],
            "securityGroupIds": ["string", ...],
            "endpointPublicAccess": true|false,
            "endpointPrivateAccess": true|false,
            "publicAccessCidrs": ["string", ...]
          }

       --kubernetes-network-config (structure)
          The Kubernetes network configuration for the cluster.

          serviceIpv4Cidr -> (string)
              Don't specify a value if you select ipv6 for ipFamily . The CIDR
              block  to  assign  Kubernetes  service IP addresses from. If you
              don't specify a block, Kubernetes assigns addresses from  either
              the  10.100.0.0/16  or  172.20.0.0/16  CIDR blocks. We recommend
              that you specify a block that does not overlap with resources in
              other  networks  that  are  peered or connected to your VPC. The
              block must meet the following requirements:

              o Within  one  of  the  following  private  IP  address  blocks:
                10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, or 192.168.0.0/16.

              o Doesn't  overlap  with any CIDR block assigned to the VPC that
                you selected for VPC.

              o Between /24 and /12.

              WARNING:
                 You can only specify a custom CIDR block when  you  create  a
                 cluster  and can't change this value once the cluster is cre-
                 ated.

          ipFamily -> (string)
              Specify which IP version is used to assign  Kubernetes  Pod  and
              Service IP addresses. If you don't specify a value, ipv4 is used
              by default. You can only specify an IP family when you create  a
              cluster and can't change this value once the cluster is created.
              If you specify ipv6 , the VPC and subnets that you  specify  for
              cluster  creation  must  have  both  IPv4  and  IPv6 CIDR blocks
              assigned to them.

              You can only specify ipv6 for 1.21 and later clusters  that  use
              version  1.10.0  or  later  of the Amazon VPC CNI add-on. If you
              specify ipv6 , then ensure that your VPC meets the  requirements
              and  that  you're  familiar  with  the  considerations listed in
              Assigning IPv6 addresses to Pods and Services in the Amazon  EKS
              User Guide. If you specify ipv6 , Kubernetes assigns Service and
              Pod addresses from the unique local  address  range  (fc00::/7).
              You can't specify a custom IPv6 CIDR block.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          serviceIpv4Cidr=string,ipFamily=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "serviceIpv4Cidr": "string",
            "ipFamily": "ipv4"|"ipv6"
          }

       --logging (structure)
          Enable  or  disable  exporting the Kubernetes control plane logs for
          your cluster to CloudWatch Logs. By default, cluster  control  plane
          logs  aren't  exported to CloudWatch Logs. For more information, see
          Amazon EKS Cluster control plane logs in the * Amazon EKS User Guide
          * .

          NOTE:
              CloudWatch  Logs  ingestion,  archive storage, and data scanning
              rates apply to exported control plane logs.  For  more  informa-
              tion, see CloudWatch Pricing .

          clusterLogging -> (list)
              The  cluster  control plane logging configuration for your clus-
              ter.

              (structure)
                 An object representing the  enabled  or  disabled  Kubernetes
                 control plane logs for your cluster.

                 types -> (list)
                     The available cluster control plane log types.

                     (string)

                 enabled -> (boolean)
                     If  a log type is enabled, that log type exports its con-
                     trol plane logs to CloudWatch Logs. If a log  type  isn't
                     enabled,  that  log type doesn't export its control plane
                     logs. Each individual log type can be enabled or disabled
                     independently.

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --encryption-config (list)
          The encryption configuration for the cluster.

                     Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or alias of the KMS  key.  The
                     KMS  key must be symmetric, created in the same region as
                     the cluster, and if the KMS key was created in a  differ-
                     ent  account,  the  user must have access to the KMS key.

            ...
          ]

       --kubernetes-version (string)
          The desired Kubernetes version for your cluster. If you don't  spec-
          ify  a  value  here,  the  latest version available in Amazon EKS is
          used.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

          roleArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the IAM role that provides
              permissions for the Kubernetes control plane to  make  calls  to
              Amazon Web Services API operations on your behalf.

          resourcesVpcConfig -> (structure)
              The  VPC configuration used by the cluster control plane. Amazon
              EKS VPC resources have specific requirements  to  work  properly
              with Kubernetes. For more information, see Cluster VPC Consider-
              ations and Cluster Security Group Considerations in  the  Amazon
              EKS User Guide .

              subnetIds -> (list)
                 The subnets associated with your cluster.

                 (string)

              securityGroupIds -> (list)
                 The security groups associated with the cross-account elastic
                 network interfaces  that  are  used  to  allow  communication
                 between your nodes and the Kubernetes control plane.

                 (string)

              clusterSecurityGroupId -> (string)
                 The cluster security group that was created by Amazon EKS for
                 the cluster. Managed node groups use this security group  for
                 control-plane-to-data-plane communication.

              vpcId -> (string)
                 The VPC associated with your cluster.

              endpointPublicAccess -> (boolean)
                 This  parameter  indicates  whether the Amazon EKS public API
                 server endpoint is enabled. If  the  Amazon  EKS  public  API
                 server  endpoint  is  disabled, your cluster's Kubernetes API
                 server can only receive requests that originate  from  within
                 the cluster VPC.

              endpointPrivateAccess -> (boolean)
                 This  parameter  indicates whether the Amazon EKS private API
                 server endpoint is enabled. If the  Amazon  EKS  private  API
                 server  endpoint  is  enabled,  Kubernetes  API requests that
                 originate from within your cluster's VPC use the private  VPC
                 endpoint instead of traversing the internet. If this value is
                 disabled and you have nodes or Fargate pods in  the  cluster,
                 then  ensure  that  publicAccessCidrs  includes the necessary
                 CIDR blocks for communication with the nodes or Fargate pods.
                 For  more information, see Amazon EKS cluster endpoint access
                 control in the * Amazon EKS User Guide * .

              publicAccessCidrs -> (list)
                 The CIDR blocks that are allowed  access  to  your  cluster's
                 public  Kubernetes  API server endpoint. Communication to the
                 endpoint from addresses outside of the listed CIDR blocks  is
                 denied.  The  default value is 0.0.0.0/0 . If you've disabled
                 private endpoint access and you have nodes or Fargate pods in
                 the  cluster,  then ensure that the necessary CIDR blocks are
                 listed. For more information, see Amazon EKS cluster endpoint
                 access control in the * Amazon EKS User Guide * .

              serviceIpv4Cidr -> (string)
                 The  CIDR  block that Kubernetes Pod and Service IP addresses
                 are assigned from. Kubernetes assigns addresses from an  IPv4
                 CIDR  block  assigned to a subnet that the node is in. If you
                 didn't specify a CIDR block when  you  created  the  cluster,
                 then   Kubernetes   assigns   addresses   from   either   the
                 10.100.0.0/16 or 172.20.0.0/16 CIDR blocks. If this was spec-
                 ified, then it was specified when the cluster was created and
                 it can't be changed.

              serviceIpv6Cidr -> (string)
                 The CIDR block that Kubernetes Pod and Service  IP  addresses
                 are assigned from if you created a 1.21 or later cluster with
                 version 1.10.0 or later of the  Amazon  VPC  CNI  add-on  and
                 specified  ipv6  for  ipFamily  when you created the cluster.
                 Kubernetes assigns addresses from the  unique  local  address
                 range (fc00::/7).

              ipFamily -> (string)
                 The  IP  family  used to assign Kubernetes Pod and Service IP
                 addresses. The IP family is always ipv4 , unless you  have  a
                 1.21  or later cluster running version 1.10.0 or later of the
                 Amazon VPC CNI add-on and specified ipv6 when you created the
                 cluster.

                        The available cluster control plane log types.

                        (string)

                     enabled -> (boolean)
                        If  a  log  type is enabled, that log type exports its
                        control plane logs to CloudWatch Logs. If a  log  type
                        isn't  enabled,  that log type doesn't export its con-
                        trol plane logs.  Each  individual  log  type  can  be
                        enabled or disabled independently.

                 The Base64-encoded certificate data required  to  communicate
                 with your cluster. Add this to the certificate-authority-data
                 section of the kubeconfig file for your cluster.

          clientRequestToken -> (string)
              Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
              idempotency of the request.

          platformVersion -> (string)
              The platform version of your Amazon EKS cluster. For more infor-
              mation, see Platform Versions in the * Amazon EKS User Guide * .

          tags -> (map)
              The  metadata that you apply to the cluster to assist with cate-
              gorization and organization. Each tag consists of a key  and  an
              optional  value.  You define both. Cluster tags do not propagate
              to any other resources associated with the cluster.

                        Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or alias of  the  KMS  key.
                        The  KMS  key  must  be symmetric, created in the same
                        region as the cluster, and if the KMS key was  created
                        in  a  different account, the user must have access to
                        the KMS key. For more information, see Allowing  Users
