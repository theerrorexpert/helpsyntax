DELETE-ADDON()                                                  DELETE-ADDON()



NAME
       delete-addon -

DESCRIPTION
       Delete an Amazon EKS add-on.

       When  you  remove the add-on, it will also be deleted from the cluster.
       You can always manually start an add-on on the cluster using the Kuber-
       netes API.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-addon
          --cluster-name <value>
          --addon-name <value>
          [--preserve | --no-preserve]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The name of the cluster to delete the add-on from.

       --addon-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  add-on.  The  name  must  match one of the names
          returned               by                `                ListAddons
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/APIReference/API_ListAddons.html`__
          .

       --preserve | --no-preserve (boolean)
          Specifying this option preserves the add-on software on your cluster
          but Amazon EKS stops managing any settings for the add-on. If an IAM
          account is associated with the add-on, it is not removed.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
