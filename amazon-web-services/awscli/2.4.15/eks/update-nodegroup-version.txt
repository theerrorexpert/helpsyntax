UPDATE-NODEGROUP-VERSION()                          UPDATE-NODEGROUP-VERSION()



NAME
       update-nodegroup-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the Kubernetes version or AMI version of an Amazon EKS managed
       node group.

       You can update a node group using a launch template only  if  the  node
       group  was  originally  deployed with a launch template. If you need to
       update a custom AMI in a node group that was  deployed  with  a  launch
       template, then update your custom AMI, specify the new ID in a new ver-
       sion of the launch template, and then update the node group to the  new
       version of the launch template.

       If  you  update  without  a launch template, then you can update to the
       latest available AMI version of a node group's current Kubernetes  ver-
       sion  by  not  specifying  a Kubernetes version in the request. You can
       update to the latest AMI version of your cluster's  current  Kubernetes
       version by specifying your cluster's Kubernetes version in the request.
       For more information, see Amazon EKS optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI  ver-
       sions in the Amazon EKS User Guide .

       You  cannot  roll back a node group to an earlier Kubernetes version or
       AMI version.

       When a node in a managed node group is  terminated  due  to  a  scaling
       action  or  update, the pods in that node are drained first. Amazon EKS
       attempts to drain the nodes gracefully and will fail if it is unable to
       do  so.  You  can force the update if Amazon EKS is unable to drain the
       nodes as a result of a pod disruption budget issue.

SYNOPSIS
            update-nodegroup-version
          --cluster-name <value>
          --nodegroup-name <value>
          [--release-version <value>]
          [--launch-template <value>]
          [--force | --no-force]
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--kubernetes-version <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The name of the Amazon EKS cluster that is associated with the  man-
          aged node group to update.

       --nodegroup-name (string)
          The name of the managed node group to update.

       --release-version (string)
          The  AMI  version  of  the  Amazon  EKS optimized AMI to use for the
          update. By default, the latest available AMI version  for  the  node
          group's Kubernetes version is used. For more information, see Amazon
          EKS optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI versions in  the  Amazon  EKS  User
          Guide  .  If  you  specify launchTemplate , and your launch template
          uses a custom AMI, then don't specify releaseVersion , or  the  node
          group update will fail. For more information about using launch tem-
          plates with Amazon EKS, see Launch template support  in  the  Amazon
          EKS User Guide.

       --launch-template (structure)
          An object representing a node group's launch template specification.
          You can only update a node group using a launch template if the node
          group was originally deployed with a launch template.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the launch template.

          version -> (string)
              The  version  of  the  launch  template to use. If no version is
              specified, then the template's default version is used.

          id -> (string)
              The ID of the launch template.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,version=string,id=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "name": "string",
            "version": "string",
            "id": "string"
          }

       --force | --no-force (boolean)
          Force the update if the existing node group's pods are unable to  be
          drained  due  to  a  pod disruption budget issue. If an update fails
          because pods could not be drained, you can force the update after it
          fails  to terminate the old node whether or not any pods are running
          on the node.

       --client-request-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you  provide  to  ensure  the
          idempotency of the request.

       --kubernetes-version (string)
          The  Kubernetes  version  to  update to. If no version is specified,
          then the Kubernetes version of the node group does not  change.  You
          can specify the Kubernetes version of the cluster to update the node
          group to the latest AMI version of the cluster's Kubernetes version.
          If you specify launchTemplate , and your launch template uses a cus-
          tom AMI, then don't specify version , or the node group update  will
          fail.  For more information about using launch templates with Amazon
          EKS, see Launch template support in the Amazon EKS User Guide.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
