NAME
       disassociate-identity-provider-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Disassociates an identity provider configuration from a cluster. If you
       disassociate an identity provider from your cluster, users included  in
       the  provider  can no longer access the cluster. However, you can still
       access the cluster with Amazon Web Services IAM users.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disassociate-identity-provider-config
          --cluster-name <value>
          --identity-provider-config <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The name of the cluster to disassociate an identity provider from.

       --identity-provider-config (structure)
          An object that represents an identity provider configuration.

          type -> (string)
              The type of the identity provider configuration.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the identity provider configuration.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          type=string,name=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "type": "string",
            "name": "string"
          }

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to  ensure  the
          idempotency of the request.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
