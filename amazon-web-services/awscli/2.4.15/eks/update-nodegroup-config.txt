UPDATE-NODEGROUP-CONFIG()                            UPDATE-NODEGROUP-CONFIG()



NAME
       update-nodegroup-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates an Amazon EKS managed node group configuration. Your node group
       continues to function during the update. The response  output  includes
       an  update  ID  that you can use to track the status of your node group
       update with the  DescribeUpdate API operation. Currently you can update
       the Kubernetes labels for a node group or the scaling configuration.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

            "addOrUpdateTaints": [
              {
                "key": "string",
                "value": "string",
                "effect": "NO_SCHEDULE"|"NO_EXECUTE"|"PREFER_NO_SCHEDULE"

          }

       --scaling-config (structure)
          The scaling configuration details for the Auto Scaling  group  after
          the update.

          minSize -> (integer)
              The  minimum  number  of  nodes  that the managed node group can
              scale in to.

          maxSize -> (integer)
              The maximum number of nodes that  the  managed  node  group  can
              scale  out to. For information about the maximum number that you
              can specify, see Amazon EKS service quotas  in  the  Amazon  EKS
              User Guide .

          desiredSize -> (integer)
              The  current  number of nodes that the managed node group should
              maintain.

              WARNING:
                 If you use  Cluster  Autoscaler,  you  shouldn't  change  the
                 desiredSize  value  directly,  as  this can cause the Cluster
                 Autoscaler to suddenly scale up or scale down.

              Whenever this parameter changes, the number of worker  nodes  in
              the node group is updated to the specified size. If this parame-
              ter is given a value that is smaller than the current number  of
              running  worker  nodes, the necessary number of worker nodes are
              terminated to match the given value. When using  CloudFormation,
              no action occurs if you remove this parameter from your CFN tem-
              plate.

              This parameter can be different from minSize in some cases, such
              as  when  starting  with extra hosts for testing. This parameter
              can also be different when you want to start with  an  estimated
              number  of  needed  hosts, but let Cluster Autoscaler reduce the
              number if there are too many. When Cluster Autoscaler  is  used,
              the  desiredSize parameter is altered by Cluster Autoscaler (but
              can  be  out-of-date  for  short  periods  of   time).   Cluster
              Autoscaler doesn't scale a managed node group lower than minSize
              or higher than maxSize.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          minSize=integer,maxSize=integer,desiredSize=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "minSize": integer,
            "maxSize": integer,
            "desiredSize": integer
          }

       --update-config (structure)
          The node group update configuration.

          maxUnavailable -> (integer)
              The maximum number of nodes unavailable at once during a version
              update.  Nodes  will be updated in parallel. This value or maxU-
              navailablePercentage is required to  have  a  value.The  maximum
              number is 100.

          maxUnavailablePercentage -> (integer)
              The  maximum  percentage  of  nodes unavailable during a version
              update. This percentage of nodes will be updated in parallel, up
              to  100  nodes at once. This value or maxUnavailable is required
              to have a value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          maxUnavailable=integer,maxUnavailablePercentage=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "maxUnavailable": integer,
            "maxUnavailablePercentage": integer
          }

       --client-request-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you  provide  to  ensure  the
          idempotency of the request.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
