UPDATE-CLUSTER-CONFIG()                                UPDATE-CLUSTER-CONFIG()



NAME
       update-cluster-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  an Amazon EKS cluster configuration. Your cluster continues to
       function during the update. The response output includes an  update  ID
       that  you  can  use to track the status of your cluster update with the
       DescribeUpdate API operation.

       You can use this API operation  to  enable  or  disable  exporting  the
       Kubernetes  control  plane logs for your cluster to CloudWatch Logs. By
       default, cluster control plane logs aren't exported to CloudWatch Logs.
       For  more information, see Amazon EKS Cluster Control Plane Logs in the
       * Amazon EKS User Guide * .

       NOTE:
          CloudWatch Logs ingestion, archive storage, and data scanning  rates
          apply  to  exported  control  plane  logs. For more information, see
          CloudWatch Pricing .

       You can also use this API operation to enable  or  disable  public  and
       private  access  to  your  cluster's Kubernetes API server endpoint. By
       default, public access is enabled, and private access is disabled.  For
       more information, see Amazon EKS cluster endpoint access control in the
       * Amazon EKS User Guide * .

       WARNING:
          You can't update the subnets or security group IDs for  an  existing
          cluster.

       Cluster  updates  are asynchronous, and they should finish within a few
       minutes. During an update, the cluster status moves to  UPDATING  (this
       status  transition  is  eventually consistent). When the update is com-
       plete (either Failed or Successful  ),  the  cluster  status  moves  to
       Active .

SYNOPSIS
            update-cluster-config
          --name <value>
          [--resources-vpc-config <value>]
          [--logging <value>]
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the Amazon EKS cluster to update.

       --resources-vpc-config (structure)
          An  object  representing  the VPC configuration to use for an Amazon
          EKS cluster.

          subnetIds -> (list)
              Specify subnets for your Amazon EKS nodes.  Amazon  EKS  creates
              cross-account  elastic  network  interfaces  in these subnets to
              allow communication between your nodes and the  Kubernetes  con-
              trol plane.

              (string)

          securityGroupIds -> (list)
              Specify  one or more security groups for the cross-account elas-
              tic network interfaces that Amazon EKS creates to use that allow
              communication  between  your  nodes  and  the Kubernetes control
              plane. If you don't specify any security groups, then  familiar-
              ize yourself with the difference between Amazon EKS defaults for
              clusters deployed with Kubernetes:

              o 1.14 Amazon EKS platform version eks.2 and earlier

              o 1.14 Amazon EKS platform version eks.3 and later

              For more information, see Amazon EKS security  group  considera-
              tions in the * Amazon EKS User Guide * .

              (string)

          endpointPublicAccess -> (boolean)
              Set  this  value to false to disable public access to your clus-
              ter's Kubernetes API server  endpoint.  If  you  disable  public
              access,  your  cluster's  Kubernetes API server can only receive
              requests from within the cluster VPC. The default value for this
              parameter  is true , which enables public access for your Kuber-
              netes API server. For more information, see Amazon  EKS  cluster
              endpoint access control in the * Amazon EKS User Guide * .

          endpointPrivateAccess -> (boolean)
              Set  this  value to true to enable private access for your clus-
              ter's Kubernetes API server  endpoint.  If  you  enable  private
              access,  Kubernetes  API requests from within your cluster's VPC
              use the private VPC endpoint. The default value for this parame-
              ter is false , which disables private access for your Kubernetes
              API server. If you disable private access and you have nodes  or
              Fargate  pods in the cluster, then ensure that publicAccessCidrs
              includes the necessary CIDR blocks for  communication  with  the
              nodes  or  Fargate  pods.  For  more information, see Amazon EKS
              cluster endpoint access control in the * Amazon EKS User Guide *
              .

          publicAccessCidrs -> (list)
              The CIDR blocks that are allowed access to your cluster's public
              Kubernetes API server endpoint. Communication  to  the  endpoint
              from  addresses  outside  of the CIDR blocks that you specify is
              denied. The default value is 0.0.0.0/0 . If you've disabled pri-
              vate  endpoint  access and you have nodes or Fargate pods in the
              cluster, then ensure that you specify the necessary CIDR blocks.
              For  more  information,  see  Amazon EKS cluster endpoint access
              control in the * Amazon EKS User Guide * .

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          subnetIds=string,string,securityGroupIds=string,string,endpointPublicAccess=boolean,endpointPrivateAccess=boolean,publicAccessCidrs=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "subnetIds": ["string", ...],
            "securityGroupIds": ["string", ...],
            "endpointPublicAccess": true|false,
            "endpointPrivateAccess": true|false,
            "publicAccessCidrs": ["string", ...]
          }

       --logging (structure)
          Enable or disable exporting the Kubernetes control  plane  logs  for
          your  cluster  to CloudWatch Logs. By default, cluster control plane
          logs aren't exported to CloudWatch Logs. For more  information,  see
          Amazon EKS cluster control plane logs in the * Amazon EKS User Guide
          * .

          NOTE:
              CloudWatch Logs ingestion, archive storage,  and  data  scanning
              rates  apply  to  exported control plane logs. For more informa-
              tion, see CloudWatch Pricing .

          clusterLogging -> (list)
              The cluster control plane logging configuration for  your  clus-
              ter.

              (structure)
                 An  object  representing  the  enabled or disabled Kubernetes
                 control plane logs for your cluster.

                 types -> (list)
                     The available cluster control plane log types.

                     (string)

                 enabled -> (boolean)
                     If a log type is enabled, that log type exports its  con-
                     trol  plane  logs to CloudWatch Logs. If a log type isn't
                     enabled, that log type doesn't export its  control  plane
                     logs. Each individual log type can be enabled or disabled
                     independently.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "clusterLogging": [
              {
                "types": ["api"|"audit"|"authenticator"|"controllerManager"|"scheduler", ...],
                "enabled": true|false
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --client-request-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you  provide  to  ensure  the
          idempotency of the request.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.
