DESCRIBE-DELIVERY-CHANNELS()                      DESCRIBE-DELIVERY-CHANNELS()



NAME
       describe-delivery-channels -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  details  about  the  specified delivery channel. If a delivery
       channel is not specified, this action returns the details of all deliv-
       ery channels associated with the account.

       NOTE:
          Currently,  you  can specify only one delivery channel per region in
          your account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-delivery-channels
          [--delivery-channel-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --delivery-channel-names (list)
          A list of delivery channel names.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get details about the delivery channel

       The following command returns details about the delivery channel:

          aws configservice describe-delivery-channels

       Output:

          {
              "DeliveryChannels": [
                  {
                      "snsTopicARN": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:config-topic",
                      "name": "default",
                      "s3BucketName": "config-bucket-123456789012"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       DeliveryChannels -> (list)
          A list that contains the  descriptions  of  the  specified  delivery
          channel.

          (structure)
              The  channel  through  which  Config  delivers notifications and
              updated configuration states.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the delivery channel. By default, Config  assigns
                 the  name  "default"  when  creating the delivery channel. To
                 change the delivery channel name, you must use the  DeleteDe-
                 liveryChannel action to delete your current delivery channel,
                 and then you must use the PutDeliveryChannel command to  cre-
                 ate a delivery channel that has the desired name.

              s3BucketName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  Amazon S3 bucket to which Config delivers
                 configuration snapshots and configuration history files.

                 If you specify a bucket that belongs to  another  Amazon  Web
                 Services  account,  that bucket must have policies that grant
                 access permissions  to  Config.  For  more  information,  see
                 Permissions  for the Amazon S3 Bucket in the Config Developer
                 Guide.

              s3KeyPrefix -> (string)
                 The prefix for the specified Amazon S3 bucket.

              s3KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Key Management  Service
                 (KMS ) KMS key (KMS key) used to encrypt objects delivered by
                 Config. Must belong to the same Region as the destination  S3
                 bucket.

              snsTopicARN -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic to
                 which Config sends notifications about configuration changes.

                 If  you  choose  a topic from another account, the topic must
                 have policies that grant access permissions  to  Config.  For
                 more information, see Permissions for the Amazon SNS Topic in
                 the Config Developer Guide.

              configSnapshotDeliveryProperties -> (structure)
                 The options for how often Config delivers configuration snap-
                 shots to the Amazon S3 bucket.

                 deliveryFrequency -> (string)
                     The  frequency  with  which Config delivers configuration
                     snapshots.
