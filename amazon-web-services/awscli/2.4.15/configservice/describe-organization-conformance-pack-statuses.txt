DESCRIBE-ORGANIZATION-CONFORMDESCRIBE-ORGANIZATION-CONFORMANCE-PACK-STATUSES()



NAME
       describe-organization-conformance-pack-statuses -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides organization conformance pack deployment status for an organi-
       zation.

       NOTE:
          The status is not considered successful until  organization  confor-
          mance  pack is successfully deployed in all the member accounts with
          an exception of excluded accounts.

          When you specify the limit and the next token, you receive  a  pagi-
          nated response. Limit and next token are not applicable if you spec-
          ify organization conformance pack names. They are  only  applicable,
          when you request all the organization conformance packs.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-organization-conformance-pack-statuses  is  a paginated opera-
       tion. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the  entire
       data  set  of  results.  You  can  disable  pagination by providing the
       --no-paginate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argu-
       ment  on  a  paginated response, the --query argument must extract data
       from the results of the following query  expressions:  OrganizationCon-
       formancePackStatuses

SYNOPSIS
            describe-organization-conformance-pack-statuses
          [--organization-conformance-pack-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --organization-conformance-pack-names (list)
          The  names of organization conformance packs for which you want sta-
          tus details. If you do not specify any names, Config returns details
          for all your organization conformance packs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       OrganizationConformancePackStatuses -> (list)
          A list of OrganizationConformancePackStatus objects.

          (structure)
              Returns the status for an organization conformance  pack  in  an
              organization.

              OrganizationConformancePackName -> (string)
                 The name that you assign to organization conformance pack.

              Status -> (string)
                 Indicates  deployment  status  of an organization conformance
                 pack. When  master  account  calls  PutOrganizationConforman-
                 cePack for the first time, conformance pack status is created
                 in all the member accounts. When master account calls  PutOr-
                 ganizationConformancePack  for  the  second time, conformance
                 pack status is updated in all the member accounts.  Addition-
                 ally,  conformance  pack  status  is updated when one or more
                 member accounts join or leave  an  organization.  Conformance
                 pack  status is deleted when the master account deletes Orga-
                 nizationConformancePack in all the member accounts  and  dis-
                 ables  service  access  for  config-multiaccountsetup.amazon-
                 aws.com .

                 Config sets the state of the conformance pack to:

                 o CREATE_SUCCESSFUL when an organization conformance pack has
                   been successfully created in all the member accounts.

                 o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS  when  an  organization conformance pack
                   creation is in progress.

                 o CREATE_FAILED when an organization  conformance  pack  cre-
                   ation  failed  in  one  or more member accounts within that
                   organization.

                 o DELETE_FAILED when an organization conformance  pack  dele-
                   tion  failed  in  one  or  more member accounts within that
                   organization.

                 o DELETE_IN_PROGRESS when an  organization  conformance  pack
                   deletion is in progress.

                 o DELETE_SUCCESSFUL when an organization conformance pack has
                   been successfully deleted from all the member accounts.

                 o UPDATE_SUCCESSFUL when an organization conformance pack has
                   been successfully updated in all the member accounts.

                 o UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS  when  an  organization conformance pack
                   update is in progress.

                 o UPDATE_FAILED when an organization conformance pack  update
                   failed in one or more member accounts within that organiza-
                   tion.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 An error code that is returned when organization  conformance
                 pack creation or deletion has failed in a member account.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 An  error  message  indicating  that organization conformance
                 pack creation or deletion failed due to an error.

              LastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp of the last update.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken string returned on a previous page that you use to get
          the next page of results in a paginated response.
