DESCRIBE-ORGANIZATION-CONFORMANCE-PACDESCRIBE-ORGANIZATION-CONFORMANCE-PACKS()



NAME
       describe-organization-conformance-packs -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of organization conformance packs.

       NOTE:
          When  you  specify the limit and the next token, you receive a pagi-
          nated response.

          Limit and next token are not applicable if you specify  organization
          conformance  packs names. They are only applicable, when you request
          all the organization conformance packs.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-organization-conformance-packs is a paginated operation.  Mul-
       tiple  API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set
       of results. You can disable pagination by providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: OrganizationConformancePacks

SYNOPSIS
            describe-organization-conformance-packs
          [--organization-conformance-pack-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --organization-conformance-pack-names (list)
          The name that you assign to an organization conformance pack.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     conformance pack, both of which you define. Keys can have
                     a maximum character length of 255 characters, and  values
                     can have a maximum length of 4096 characters.

                     ParameterName -> (string)
                        One part of a key-value pair.

                     ParameterValue -> (string)
