GET-COMPLIANCE-SUMMARY-BY-RESOURCE-TYGET-COMPLIANCE-SUMMARY-BY-RESOURCE-TYPE()



NAME
       get-compliance-summary-by-resource-type -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the number of resources that are compliant and the number that
       are noncompliant. You can specify one or more  resource  types  to  get
       these  numbers  for  each resource type. The maximum number returned is
       100.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-compliance-summary-by-resource-type
          [--resource-types <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-types (list)
          Specify one or more resource types to get the  number  of  resources
          that  are  compliant  and  the number that are noncompliant for each
          resource type.

          For this request, you can specify an Amazon  Web  Services  resource
          type  such as AWS::EC2::Instance . You can specify that the resource
          type is an Amazon Web Services account by specifying  AWS::::Account
          .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the compliance summary for all resource types

       The following command returns the number of AWS resources that are non-
       compliant and the number that are compliant:

          aws configservice get-compliance-summary-by-resource-type

       In the output, the value for each CappedCount attribute  indicates  how
       many resources are compliant or noncompliant.

       Output:

          {
              "ComplianceSummariesByResourceType": [
                  {
                      "ComplianceSummary": {
                          "NonCompliantResourceCount": {
                              "CappedCount": 16,
                              "CapExceeded": false
                          },
                          "ComplianceSummaryTimestamp": 1453237464.543,
                          "CompliantResourceCount": {
                              "CappedCount": 10,
                              "CapExceeded": false
                          }
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }

       To get the compliance summary for a specific resource type

       The following command returns the number of EC2 instances that are non-
       compliant and the number that are compliant:

          aws configservice get-compliance-summary-by-resource-type --resource-types AWS::EC2::Instance

       In the output, the value for each CappedCount attribute  indicates  how
       many resources are compliant or noncompliant.

       Output:

          {
              "ComplianceSummariesByResourceType": [
                  {
                      "ResourceType": "AWS::EC2::Instance",
                      "ComplianceSummary": {
                          "NonCompliantResourceCount": {
                              "CappedCount": 3,
                              "CapExceeded": false
                          },
                          "ComplianceSummaryTimestamp": 1452204923.518,
                          "CompliantResourceCount": {
                              "CappedCount": 7,
                              "CapExceeded": false
                          }
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }
