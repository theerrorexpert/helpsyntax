NAME
       delete-remediation-exceptions -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  one  or  more remediation exceptions mentioned in the resource
       keys.

       NOTE:
          Config generates a remediation exception when a problem occurs  exe-
          cuting  a  remediation  action  to  a specific resource. Remediation
          exceptions blocks auto-remediation until the exception is cleared.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-remediation-exceptions
          --config-rule-name <value>
          --resource-keys <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --config-rule-name (string)
          The name of the Config rule for which you want to delete remediation
          exception configuration.

       --resource-keys (list)
          An  exception  list  of resource exception keys to be processed with
          the current request. Config adds exception for  each  resource  key.
          For example, Config adds 3 exceptions for 3 resource keys.

          (structure)
              The  details  that  identify a resource within Config, including
              the resource type and resource ID.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of a resource.

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the resource (for example., sg-xxxxxx).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ResourceType=string,ResourceId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ResourceType": "string",
              "ResourceId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FailedBatches -> (list)
          Returns  a  list  of  failed  delete  remediation  exceptions  batch
          objects. Each object in the batch consists of a list of failed items
          and failure messages.

          (structure)
              List of each of the failed delete  remediation  exceptions  with
              specific reasons.

              FailureMessage -> (string)
                 Returns  a  failure message for delete remediation exception.
                 For example, Config creates an exception due to  an  internal
                 error.

              FailedItems -> (list)
                 Returns  remediation  exception  resource  key  object of the
                 failed items.

                 (structure)
                     The details  that  identify  a  resource  within  Config,
                     including the resource type and resource ID.

                     ResourceType -> (string)
                        The type of a resource.

                     ResourceId -> (string)
                        The ID of the resource (for example., sg-xxxxxx).
