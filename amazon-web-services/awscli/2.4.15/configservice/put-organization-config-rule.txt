PUT-ORGANIZATION-CONFIG-RULE()                  PUT-ORGANIZATION-CONFIG-RULE()



NAME
       put-organization-config-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  or  updates organization config rule for your entire organization
       evaluating whether your Amazon Web Services resources comply with  your
       desired configurations.

       Only  a  master  account  and  a  delegated administrator can create or
       update an organization config rule. When calling this API with a  dele-
       gated  administrator, you must ensure Organizations ListDelegatedAdmin-
       istrator permissions are added.

       This API enables organization service access through the  EnableAWSSer-
       viceAccess  action and creates a service linked role AWSServiceRoleFor-
       ConfigMultiAccountSetup  in  the  master  or  delegated   administrator
       account  of  your organization. The service linked role is created only
       when the role does not exist in the caller account. Config verifies the
       existence of role with GetRole action.

       To  use  this  API  with  delegated administrator, register a delegated
       administrator by calling Amazon Web Services Organization register-del-
       egated-administrator for config-multiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com .

       You  can  use this action to create both custom Config rules and Config
       managed rules. If you are adding a new custom  Config  rule,  you  must
       first  create  Lambda  function  in  the  master account or a delegated
       administrator that the rule invokes to  evaluate  your  resources.  You
       also  need  to  create  an  IAM role in the managed-account that can be
       assumed by the Lambda function. When you use the  PutOrganizationConfi-
       gRule  action  to  add  the rule to Config, you must specify the Amazon
       Resource Name (ARN) that Lambda assigns to the  function.  If  you  are
       adding  an  Config  managed rule, specify the rule's identifier for the
       RuleIdentifier key.

       The maximum number of organization config rules that Config supports is
       150 and 3 delegated administrator per organization.

       NOTE:
          Prerequisite:  Ensure  you  call EnableAllFeatures API to enable all
          features in an organization.

          Specify either OrganizationCustomRuleMetadata or OrganizationManage-
          dRuleMetadata .

SYNOPSIS
            put-organization-config-rule
          --organization-config-rule-name <value>
          [--organization-managed-rule-metadata <value>]
          [--organization-custom-rule-metadata <value>]
          [--excluded-accounts <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --organization-config-rule-name (string)
          The name that you assign to an organization config rule.

       --organization-managed-rule-metadata (structure)
          An OrganizationManagedRuleMetadata object.

          Description -> (string)
              The description that you provide for organization config rule.

          RuleIdentifier -> (string)
              For  organization  config managed rules, a predefined identifier
              from a list. For example, IAM_PASSWORD_POLICY is a managed rule.
              To reference a managed rule, see Using Config managed rules .

          InputParameters -> (string)
              A  string, in JSON format, that is passed to organization config
              rule Lambda function.

          MaximumExecutionFrequency -> (string)
              The maximum frequency with which Config runs evaluations  for  a
              rule.  You are using an Config managed rule that is triggered at
              a periodic frequency.

              NOTE:
                 By default, rules with a periodic trigger are evaluated every
                 24  hours. To change the frequency, specify a valid value for
                 the MaximumExecutionFrequency parameter.

          ResourceTypesScope -> (list)
              The type of the Amazon Web Services resource that was evaluated.

              (string)

          ResourceIdScope -> (string)
              The ID of the Amazon Web Services resource that was evaluated.

          TagKeyScope -> (string)
              One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is a gen-
              eral label that acts like a category for more specific tag  val-
              ues.

          TagValueScope -> (string)
              The  optional  part  of  a  key-value pair that make up a tag. A
              value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

              The lambda function ARN.

          OrganizationConfigRuleTriggerTypes -> (list)
              The type of notification that triggers Config to run an  evalua-
              tion  for  a  rule.  You  can specify the following notification
              types:

              o ConfigurationItemChangeNotification - Triggers  an  evaluation
                when  Config  delivers  a  configuration item as a result of a
                resource change.

              o OversizedConfigurationItemChangeNotification  -  Triggers   an
                evaluation  when  Config  delivers  an oversized configuration
                item. Config  may  generate  this  notification  type  when  a
                resource changes and the notification exceeds the maximum size
                allowed by Amazon SNS.

              o ScheduledNotification - Triggers a periodic evaluation at  the
                frequency specified for MaximumExecutionFrequency .

          InputParameters -> (string)

              rule Lambda function.

          MaximumExecutionFrequency -> (string)
              The maximum frequency with which Config runs evaluations  for  a
              rule.  Your  custom  rule  is triggered when Config delivers the
              configuration snapshot. For more information,  see   ConfigSnap-
              shotDeliveryProperties .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       OrganizationConfigRuleArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an organization config rule.
