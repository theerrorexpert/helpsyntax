DESCRIBE-AGGREGATE-COMPLIANCE-BDESCRIBE-AGGREGATE-COMPLIANCE-BY-CONFIG-RULES()



NAME
       describe-aggregate-compliance-by-config-rules -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of compliant and noncompliant rules with the number of
       resources for compliant and noncompliant rules. Does not display  rules
       that do not have compliance results.

       NOTE:
          The results can return an empty result page, but if you have a next-
          Token , the results are displayed on the next page.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-aggregate-compliance-by-config-rules is a paginated operation.
       Multiple  API  calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data
       set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the  --no-pagi-
       nate  argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a
       paginated response, the --query argument must  extract  data  from  the
       results of the following query expressions: AggregateComplianceByConfi-
       gRules

SYNOPSIS
            describe-aggregate-compliance-by-config-rules
          --configuration-aggregator-name <value>
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --configuration-aggregator-name (string)
          The name of the configuration aggregator.

       --filters (structure)
          Filters the results by ConfigRuleComplianceFilters object.

          ConfigRuleName -> (string)
              The name of the Config rule.

          ComplianceType -> (string)
              The rule compliance status.

              For the ConfigRuleComplianceFilters data type,  Config  supports
              only  COMPLIANT  and NON_COMPLIANT . Config does not support the
              NOT_APPLICABLE and the INSUFFICIENT_DATA values.

          AccountId -> (string)
              The 12-digit account ID of the source account.

          AwsRegion -> (string)
              The source region where the data is aggregated.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ConfigRuleName=string,ComplianceType=string,AccountId=string,AwsRegion=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ConfigRuleName": "string",
            "ComplianceType": "COMPLIANT"|"NON_COMPLIANT"|"NOT_APPLICABLE"|"INSUFFICIENT_DATA",
            "AccountId": "string",
            "AwsRegion": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AggregateComplianceByConfigRules -> (list)
          Returns a list of AggregateComplianceByConfigRule object.

          (structure)
              Indicates  whether  an Config rule is compliant based on account
              ID, region, compliance, and rule name.

              A rule is compliant if all of the resources that the rule evalu-
              ated  comply  with  it.  It  is  noncompliant  if  any  of these
              resources do not comply.

              ConfigRuleName -> (string)
                 The name of the Config rule.

              Compliance -> (structure)
                 Indicates whether an Amazon Web Services resource  or  Config
                 rule  is  compliant  and  provides the number of contributors
                 that affect the compliance.

                 ComplianceType -> (string)
                     Indicates whether an Amazon Web Services resource or Con-
                     fig rule is compliant.

                     A  resource  is  compliant if it complies with all of the
                     Config rules that evaluate it. A resource is noncompliant
                     if it does not comply with one or more of these rules.

                     A rule is compliant if all of the resources that the rule
                     evaluates comply with it. A rule is noncompliant  if  any
                     of these resources do not comply.

                     Config returns the INSUFFICIENT_DATA value when no evalu-
                     ation results are available for the Amazon  Web  Services
                     resource or Config rule.

                     For  the  Compliance data type, Config supports only COM-
                     PLIANT , NON_COMPLIANT ,  and  INSUFFICIENT_DATA  values.
                     Config  does not support the NOT_APPLICABLE value for the
                     Compliance data type.

                 ComplianceContributorCount -> (structure)
                     The number of Amazon Web  Services  resources  or  Config
                     rules that cause a result of NON_COMPLIANT , up to a max-
                     imum number.

                     CappedCount -> (integer)
                        The number of Amazon Web Services resources or  Config
                        rules  responsible  for  the current compliance of the
                        item.

                     CapExceeded -> (boolean)
                        Indicates whether the maximum count is reached.

              AccountId -> (string)
                 The 12-digit account ID of the source account.

              AwsRegion -> (string)
                 The source region from where the data is aggregated.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken string returned on a previous page that you use to get
          the next page of results in a paginated response.
