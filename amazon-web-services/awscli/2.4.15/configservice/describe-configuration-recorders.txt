NAME
       describe-configuration-recorders -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  details for the specified configuration recorders. If the
       configuration recorder  is  not  specified,  this  action  returns  the
       details for all configuration recorders associated with the account.

       NOTE:
          Currently,  you  can  specify  only  one  configuration recorder per
          region in your account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-configuration-recorders
          [--configuration-recorder-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --configuration-recorder-names (list)
          A list of configuration recorder names.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get details about the configuration recorder

       The following command returns details about the  default  configuration
       recorder:

          aws configservice describe-configuration-recorders

       Output:

          {
              "ConfigurationRecorders": [
                  {
                      "recordingGroup": {
                          "allSupported": true,
                          "resourceTypes": [],
                          "includeGlobalResourceTypes": true
                      },
                      "roleARN": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/config-ConfigRole-A1B2C3D4E5F6",
                      "name": "default"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       ConfigurationRecorders -> (list)
          A list that contains the descriptions of the specified configuration
          recorders.

          (structure)
              An object that represents the recording of configuration changes
              of an Amazon Web Services resource.

              name -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the recorder. By default, Config automatically
                 assigns the name "default" when  creating  the  configuration
                 recorder. You cannot change the assigned name.

              roleARN -> (string)
                 Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the IAM role used to describe
                 the  Amazon  Web  Services  resources  associated  with   the
                 account.

              recordingGroup -> (structure)
                 Specifies  the  types  of  Amazon  Web Services resources for
                 which Config records configuration changes.

                 allSupported -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether Config  records  configuration  changes
                     for every supported type of regional resource.

                     If you set this option to true , when Config adds support
                     for a new type of regional resource, it starts  recording
                     resources of that type automatically.

                     If  you  set this option to true , you cannot enumerate a
                     list of resourceTypes .

                 includeGlobalResourceTypes -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether Config includes all supported types  of
                     global  resources  (for  example, IAM resources) with the
                     resources that it records.

                     Before you can set this option to true , you must set the
                     allSupported option to true .

                     If you set this option to true , when Config adds support
                     for a new type of global resource,  it  starts  recording
                     resources of that type automatically.

                     The configuration details for any global resource are the
                     same in all regions. To prevent  duplicate  configuration
                     items, you should consider customizing Config in only one
                     region to record global resources.

                 resourceTypes -> (list)
                     A comma-separated list that specifies the types of Amazon
                     Web  Services resources for which Config records configu-
                     ration  changes  (for  example,   AWS::EC2::Instance   or
                     AWS::CloudTrail::Trail ).

                     To  record  all  configuration  changes, you must set the
                     allSupported option to true .

                     If you set this option to false , when Config  adds  sup-
                     port  for  a  new  type  of  resource, it will not record
                     resources of that type unless you manually add that  type
                     to your recording group.

                     For  a  list  of  valid  resourceTypes  values,  see  the
                     resourceType Value column in Supported  Amazon  Web  Ser-
                     vices resource Types .
