PUT-CONFIGURATION-AGGREGATOR()                  PUT-CONFIGURATION-AGGREGATOR()



NAME
       put-configuration-aggregator -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  and  updates  the  configuration  aggregator with the selected
       source accounts and regions.  The  source  account  can  be  individual
       account(s) or an organization.
          accountIds  that are passed will be replaced with existing accounts.
          If you want to add additional accounts  into  the  aggregator,  call
          DescribeAggregator  to get the previous accounts and then append new
          ones.

       NOTE:
          Config should be enabled in source accounts and regions you want  to
          aggregate.

          If your source type is an organization, you must be signed in to the
          management account or a registered delegated administrator  and  all
          the  features must be enabled in your organization. If the caller is
          a management account, Config  calls  EnableAwsServiceAccess  API  to
          enable  integration  between Config and Organizations. If the caller
          is a registered  delegated  administrator,  Config  calls  ListDele-
          gatedAdministrators API to verify whether the caller is a valid del-
          egated administrator.

          To register a delegated  administrator,  see  Register  a  Delegated
          Administrator in the Config developer guide.

                 regions.

                 The source regions being aggregated.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AccountIds=string,string,AllAwsRegions=boolean,AwsRegions=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "AccountIds": ["string", ...],
              "AllAwsRegions": true|false,
              "AwsRegions": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --organization-aggregation-source (structure)
          An OrganizationAggregationSource object.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              ARN of the IAM role used to retrieve Amazon Web Services Organi-
              zation details associated with the aggregator account.

          AwsRegions -> (list)
              The source regions being aggregated.

              (string)

          AllAwsRegions -> (boolean)
              If true, aggregate existing Config regions and future regions.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RoleArn=string,AwsRegions=string,string,AllAwsRegions=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "RoleArn": "string",
            "AwsRegions": ["string", ...],
            "AllAwsRegions": true|false
          }

       --tags (list)
          An array of tag object.

          (structure)
              The  tags  for  the  resource.  The metadata that you apply to a
              resource to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag con-
              sists  of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.
              Tag keys can have a maximum character length of 128  characters,
              and tag values can have a maximum length of 256 characters.

              Key -> (string)
                 One  part  of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  optional  part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
