NAME
       get-organization-conformance-pack-detailed-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  detailed status for each member account within an organization
       for a given organization conformance pack.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-organization-conformance-pack-detailed-status is a paginated opera-
       tion.  Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire
       data set of results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by  providing  the
       --no-paginate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argu-
       ment on a paginated response, the --query argument  must  extract  data
       from  the  results of the following query expressions: OrganizationCon-
       formancePackDetailedStatuses

SYNOPSIS
            get-organization-conformance-pack-detailed-status
          --organization-conformance-pack-name <value>
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --organization-conformance-pack-name (string)
          The name of organization conformance pack for which you want  status
          details for member accounts.

       --filters (structure)
          An OrganizationResourceDetailedStatusFilters object.

          AccountId -> (string)
              The  12-digit account ID of the member account within an organi-
              zation.

          Status -> (string)
              Indicates deployment status for conformance  pack  in  a  member
              account.  When  master  account  calls PutOrganizationConforman-
              cePack action for the first time,  conformance  pack  status  is
              created  in the member account. When master account calls PutOr-
              ganizationConformancePack action for the  second  time,  confor-
              mance  pack status is updated in the member account. Conformance
              pack status is deleted when the master account deletes Organiza-
              tionConformancePack  and disables service access for config-mul-
              tiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com .

              Config sets the state of the conformance pack to:

              o CREATE_SUCCESSFUL when conformance pack has  been  created  in
                the member account.

              o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS  when  conformance pack is being created in
                the member account.

              o CREATE_FAILED when conformance pack creation has failed in the
                member account.

              o DELETE_FAILED when conformance pack deletion has failed in the
                member account.

              o DELETE_IN_PROGRESS when conformance pack is being  deleted  in
                the member account.

              o DELETE_SUCCESSFUL  when  conformance  pack has been deleted in
                the member account.

              o UPDATE_SUCCESSFUL when conformance pack has  been  updated  in
                the member account.

              o UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS  when  conformance pack is being updated in
                the member account.

              o UPDATE_FAILED when conformance pack deletion has failed in the
                member account.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AccountId=string,Status=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AccountId": "string",
            "Status": "CREATE_SUCCESSFUL"|"CREATE_IN_PROGRESS"|"CREATE_FAILED"|"DELETE_SUCCESSFUL"|"DELETE_FAILED"|"DELETE_IN_PROGRESS"|"UPDATE_SUCCESSFUL"|"UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS"|"UPDATE_FAILED"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
