SYNOPSIS
            get-conformance-pack-compliance-details
          --conformance-pack-name <value>
          [--filters <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --conformance-pack-name (string)
          Name of the conformance pack.

       --filters (structure)
          A ConformancePackEvaluationFilters object.

          ConfigRuleNames -> (list)
              Filters the results by Config rule names.

              (string)

          ComplianceType -> (string)
              Filters the results by compliance.

              The allowed values are COMPLIANT and  NON_COMPLIANT  .  INSUFFI-
              CIENT_DATA is not supported.

          ResourceType -> (string)
              Filters   the   results  by  the  resource  type  (for  example,
              "AWS::EC2::Instance" ).

          ResourceIds -> (list)
              Filters the results by resource IDs.

              NOTE:
                 This is valid only when you provide resource type.  If  there
                 is no resource type, you will see an error.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ConfigRuleNames=string,string,ComplianceType=string,ResourceType=string,ResourceIds=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ConfigRuleNames": ["string", ...],
            "ComplianceType": "COMPLIANT"|"NON_COMPLIANT"|"INSUFFICIENT_DATA",
            "ResourceType": "string",
            "ResourceIds": ["string", ...]
          }

       --limit (integer)
          The  maximum  number of evaluation results returned on each page. If
          you do no specify a number, Config uses the default. The default  is
          100.

       --next-token (string)
          The  nextToken string returned in a previous request that you use to
          request the next page of results in a paginated response.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       ConformancePackName -> (string)
          Name of the conformance pack.

       ConformancePackRuleEvaluationResults -> (list)
          Returns a list of ConformancePackEvaluationResult objects.

          (structure)
              The details of a conformance pack  evaluation.  Provides  Config
              rule  and  Amazon Web Services resource type that was evaluated,
              the compliance of the conformance pack, related time stamps, and
              supplementary information.

              ComplianceType -> (string)
                 The  compliance  type.  The  allowed values are COMPLIANT and

              EvaluationResultIdentifier -> (structure)
                 Uniquely identifies an evaluation result.

                 EvaluationResultQualifier -> (structure)
                     Identifies an Config rule used to evaluate an Amazon  Web
                     Services  resource,  and  provides the type and ID of the

                     ConfigRuleName -> (string)
                        The name of the Config rule that was used in the eval-
                        uation.

                 OrderingTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                     The  time  of  the event that triggered the evaluation of
                     your Amazon Web Services resources. The time can indicate
                     when Config delivered a configuration item change notifi-
                     cation, or it can indicate when Config delivered the con-
                     figuration  snapshot,  depending on which event triggered
                     the evaluation.

              ConfigRuleInvokedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time when  Config  rule  evaluated  Amazon  Web  Services

              Annotation -> (string)
                 Supplementary information about how the evaluation determined
                 the compliance.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken string returned in a previous request that you use  to
          request the next page of results in a paginated response.
