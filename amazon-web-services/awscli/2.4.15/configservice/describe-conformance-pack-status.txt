NAME
       describe-conformance-pack-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides one or more conformance packs deployment status.

       NOTE:
          If there are no conformance packs then you will see an empty result.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-conformance-pack-status is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: ConformancePackStatusDetails

SYNOPSIS
            describe-conformance-pack-status
          [--conformance-pack-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --conformance-pack-names (list)
          Comma-separated list of conformance pack names.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ConformancePackStatusDetails -> (list)
          A list of ConformancePackStatusDetail objects.

          (structure)
              Status details of a conformance pack.

              ConformancePackName -> (string)
                 Name of the conformance pack.

              ConformancePackId -> (string)
                 ID of the conformance pack.

              ConformancePackArn -> (string)
                 Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of comformance pack.

              ConformancePackState -> (string)
                 Indicates deployment status of conformance pack.

                 Config sets the state of the conformance pack to:

                 o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS when a conformance pack creation  is  in
                   progress for an account.

                 o CREATE_COMPLETE  when  a conformance pack has been success-
                   fully created in your account.

                 o CREATE_FAILED when a conformance pack  creation  failed  in
                   your account.

                 o DELETE_IN_PROGRESS  when  a conformance pack deletion is in
                   progress.

                 o DELETE_FAILED when a conformance pack  deletion  failed  in
                   your account.

              StackArn -> (string)
                 Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of CloudFormation stack.

              ConformancePackStatusReason -> (string)
                 The reason of conformance pack creation failure.

              LastUpdateRequestedTime -> (timestamp)
                 Last  time  when  conformation  pack  creation and update was
                 requested.

              LastUpdateCompletedTime -> (timestamp)
                 Last time when conformation pack creation and update was suc-
                 cessful.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  nextToken string returned in a previous request that you use to
          request the next page of results in a paginated response.
