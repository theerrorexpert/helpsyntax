NAME
       describe-remediation-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the details of one or more remediation configurations.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-remediation-configurations
          --config-rule-names <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --config-rule-names (list)
          A  list of Config rule names of remediation configurations for which
          you want details.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RemediationConfigurations -> (list)
          Returns a remediation configuration object.

          (structure)
              An object that represents the details about the remediation con-
              figuration that includes the remediation action, parameters, and
              data to execute the action.

              ConfigRuleName -> (string)
                 The name of the Config rule.

              TargetType -> (string)
                 The type of the  target.  Target  executes  remediation.  For
                 example, SSM document.

              TargetId -> (string)
                 Target ID is the name of the public document.

              TargetVersion -> (string)
                 Version  of the target. For example, version of the SSM docu-
                 ment.

                 NOTE:
                     If you make backward incompatible changes to the SSM doc-
                     ument,  you  must  call  PutRemediationConfiguration  API
                     again to ensure the remediations can run.

              Parameters -> (map)
                 An object of the RemediationParameterValue.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     The value is either  a  dynamic  (resource)  value  or  a
                     static value. You must select either a dynamic value or a
                     static value.

                     ResourceValue -> (structure)
                        The value is dynamic and changes at run-time.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value is a resource ID.

                     StaticValue -> (structure)
                        The value is static and does not change at run-time.

                        Values -> (list)
                            A list of values. For  example,  the  ARN  of  the
                            assumed role.

                            (string)

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of a resource.

              Automatic -> (boolean)
                 The remediation is triggered automatically.

              ExecutionControls -> (structure)
                 An ExecutionControls object.

                 SsmControls -> (structure)
                     A SsmControls object.

                     ConcurrentExecutionRatePercentage -> (integer)
                        The  maximum percentage of remediation actions allowed
                        to run in parallel on the non-compliant resources  for
                        that specific rule. You can specify a percentage, such
                        as 10%. The default value is 10.

                     ErrorPercentage -> (integer)
                        The percentage of errors that are allowed  before  SSM
                        stops  running  automations on non-compliant resources
                        for that specific rule. You can specify  a  percentage
                        of  errors,  for example 10%. If you do not specifiy a
                        percentage, the default is 50%. For  example,  if  you
                        set  the  ErrorPercentage  to 40% for 10 non-compliant
                        resources, then SSM stops running the automations when
                        the fifth error is received.

              MaximumAutomaticAttempts -> (integer)
                 The  maximum  number of failed attempts for auto-remediation.
                 If you do not select a number, the default is 5.

                 For example, if you  specify  MaximumAutomaticAttempts  as  5
                 with  RetryAttemptSeconds  as  50  seconds, Config will put a
                 RemediationException on your behalf for the failing  resource
                 after the 5th failed attempt within 50 seconds.

              RetryAttemptSeconds -> (long)
                 Maximum time in seconds that Config runs auto-remediation. If
                 you do not select a number, the default is 60 seconds.

                 For example, if you specify RetryAttemptSeconds as 50 seconds
                 and MaximumAutomaticAttempts as 5, Config will run auto-reme-
                 diations 5 times within 50 seconds before throwing an  excep-
                 tion.

              Arn -> (string)
                 Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of remediation configuration.

              CreatedByService -> (string)
                 Name  of  the  service  that owns the service linked rule, if
                 applicable.
