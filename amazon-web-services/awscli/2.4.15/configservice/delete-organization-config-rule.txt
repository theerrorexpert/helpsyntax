DELETE-ORGANIZATION-CONFIG-RULE()            DELETE-ORGANIZATION-CONFIG-RULE()



NAME
       delete-organization-config-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the  specified organization config rule and all of its evalua-
       tion results from all member accounts in that organization.

       Only a master account and a delegated administrator account can  delete
       an  organization  config  rule.  When calling this API with a delegated
       administrator, you must ensure Organizations ListDelegatedAdministrator
       permissions are added.

       Config  sets  the state of a rule to DELETE_IN_PROGRESS until the dele-
       tion is complete. You cannot update a rule while it is in this state.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-organization-config-rule
          --organization-config-rule-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --organization-config-rule-name (string)
          The name of organization config rule that you want to delete.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
