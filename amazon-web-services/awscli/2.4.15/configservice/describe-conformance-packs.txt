DESCRIBE-CONFORMANCE-PACKS()                      DESCRIBE-CONFORMANCE-PACKS()



NAME
       describe-conformance-packs -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of one or more conformance packs.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-conformance-packs is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: ConformancePackDetails

SYNOPSIS
            describe-conformance-packs
          [--conformance-pack-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --conformance-pack-names (list)
          Comma-separated list of conformance pack names for  which  you  want
          details. If you do not specify any names, Config returns details for
          all your conformance packs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ConformancePackDetails -> (list)
          Returns a list of ConformancePackDetail objects.

          (structure)
              Returns  details  of a conformance pack. A conformance pack is a
              collection of Config rules and remediation actions that  can  be
              easily deployed in an account and a region.

              ConformancePackName -> (string)
                 Name of the conformance pack.

              ConformancePackArn -> (string)
                 Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the conformance pack.

              ConformancePackId -> (string)
                 ID of the conformance pack.

              DeliveryS3Bucket -> (string)
                 The  name of the Amazon S3 bucket where Config stores confor-
                 mance pack templates.

                 NOTE:
                     This field is optional.

              DeliveryS3KeyPrefix -> (string)
                 The prefix for the Amazon S3 bucket.

                 NOTE:
                     This field is optional.

              ConformancePackInputParameters -> (list)
                 A list of ConformancePackInputParameter objects.

                 (structure)
                     Input parameters in the form of key-value pairs  for  the
                     conformance pack, both of which you define. Keys can have
                     a maximum character length of 255 characters, and  values
                     can have a maximum length of 4096 characters.

                     ParameterName -> (string)
                        One part of a key-value pair.

                     ParameterValue -> (string)
                        Another part of the key-value pair.

              LastUpdateRequestedTime -> (timestamp)
                 Last time when conformation pack update was requested.

              CreatedBy -> (string)
                 Amazon  Web  Services  service  that  created the conformance
                 pack.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken string returned in a previous request that you use  to
          request the next page of results in a paginated response.
