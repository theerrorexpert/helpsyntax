GET-DISCOVERED-RESOURCE-COUNTS()              GET-DISCOVERED-RESOURCE-COUNTS()



NAME
       get-discovered-resource-counts -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  resource types, the number of each resource type, and the
       total number of resources that Config is recording in this  region  for
       your Amazon Web Services account.
          Example

       o Config is recording three resource types in the US East (Ohio) Region
         for your account: 25 EC2 instances, 20 IAM users, and 15 S3  buckets.

       o You make a call to the GetDiscoveredResourceCounts action and specify
         that you want all resource types.

       o Config returns the following:

         o The resource types (EC2 instances, IAM users, and S3 buckets).

         o The number of each resource type (25, 20, and 15).

         o The total number of all resources (60).

       The response is paginated. By default, Config lists 100   ResourceCount
       objects  on  each  page.  You  can customize this number with the limit
       parameter. The response includes a nextToken string. To  get  the  next
       page  of  results, run the request again and specify the string for the
       nextToken parameter.

       NOTE:
          If you make a call to the  GetDiscoveredResourceCounts  action,  you
          might not immediately receive resource counts in the following situ-
          ations:

          o You are a new Config customer.

          o You just enabled resource recording.

          It might take a few minutes for Config  to  record  and  count  your
          resources.  Wait  a  few  minutes  and then retry the  GetDiscovere-
          dResourceCounts action.

SYNOPSIS
            get-discovered-resource-counts
          [--resource-types <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-types (list)
          The comma-separated list that specifies the resource types that  you
          want   Config   to   return  (for  example,  "AWS::EC2::Instance"  ,
          "AWS::IAM::User" ).

          If a value for resourceTypes is not specified,  Config  returns  all
          resource  types  that  Config  is  recording  in the region for your
          account.

          NOTE:
              If the configuration recorder is turned off, Config  returns  an
              empty  list  of   ResourceCount  objects.  If  the configuration
              recorder is not recording a specific resource type (for example,
              S3  buckets),  that resource type is not returned in the list of
              ResourceCount objects.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of  ResourceCount objects returned on each  page.
          The default is 100. You cannot specify a number greater than 100. If
          you specify 0, Config uses the default.

       --next-token (string)
          The nextToken string returned on a previous page that you use to get
          the next page of results in a paginated response.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       totalDiscoveredResources -> (long)
          The total number of resources that Config is recording in the region
          for your account. If you specify resource types in the request, Con-
          fig  returns  only  the total number of resources for those resource
          types.
              Example

          o Config is recording three resource types in  the  US  East  (Ohio)
            Region for your account: 25 EC2 instances, 20 IAM users, and 15 S3
            buckets, for a total of 60 resources.

          o You make a call  to  the  GetDiscoveredResourceCounts  action  and
            specify the resource type, "AWS::EC2::Instances" , in the request.

          o Config returns 25 for totalDiscoveredResources .

       resourceCounts -> (list)
          The list of ResourceCount objects. Each object is listed in descend-
          ing order by the number of resources.

          (structure)
              An  object  that  contains  the  resource type and the number of
              resources.

              resourceType -> (string)
                 The resource type (for example, "AWS::EC2::Instance" ).

              count -> (long)
                 The number of resources.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The string that you use in a subsequent request to get the next page
          of results in a paginated response.
