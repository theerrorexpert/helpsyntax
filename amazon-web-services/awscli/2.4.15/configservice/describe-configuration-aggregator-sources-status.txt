DESCRIBE-CONFIGURATION-AGGREDESCRIBE-CONFIGURATION-AGGREGATOR-SOURCES-STATUS()



NAME
       describe-configuration-aggregator-sources-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns status information for sources within an aggregator. The status
       includes information about the last time Config verified  authorization
       between  the  source  account  and  an aggregator account. In case of a
       failure, the status contains the related error code or message.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-configuration-aggregator-sources-status is a paginated  opera-
       tion.  Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire
       data set of results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by  providing  the
       --no-paginate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argu-
       ment on a paginated response, the --query argument  must  extract  data
       from the results of the following query expressions: AggregatedSourceS-
       tatusList

SYNOPSIS
            describe-configuration-aggregator-sources-status
          --configuration-aggregator-name <value>
          [--update-status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --configuration-aggregator-name (string)
          The name of the configuration aggregator.

       --update-status (list)
          Filters the status type.

          o Valid value FAILED indicates errors while moving data.

          o Valid value SUCCEEDED indicates the data was successfully moved.

          o Valid value OUTDATED indicates the data is not the most recent.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            FAILED
            SUCCEEDED
            OUTDATED

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AggregatedSourceStatusList -> (list)
          Returns an AggregatedSourceStatus object.

          (structure)
              The  current  sync  status between the source and the aggregator
              account.

              SourceId -> (string)
                 The source account ID or an organization.

              SourceType -> (string)
                 The source account or an organization.

              AwsRegion -> (string)
                 The region authorized to collect aggregated data.

              LastUpdateStatus -> (string)
                 Filters the last updated status type.

                 o Valid value FAILED indicates errors while moving data.

                 o Valid value SUCCEEDED indicates the data  was  successfully
                   moved.

                 o Valid  value  OUTDATED  indicates  the data is not the most
                   recent.

              LastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time of the last update.

              LastErrorCode -> (string)
                 The error code that Config returned when the  source  account
                 aggregation last failed.

              LastErrorMessage -> (string)
                 The  message  indicating  that the source account aggregation
                 failed due to an error.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken string returned on a previous page that you use to get
          the next page of results in a paginated response.
