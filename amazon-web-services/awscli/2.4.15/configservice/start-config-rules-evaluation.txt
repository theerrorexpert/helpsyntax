START-CONFIG-RULES-EVALUATION()                START-CONFIG-RULES-EVALUATION()



NAME
       start-config-rules-evaluation -

DESCRIPTION
       Runs an on-demand evaluation for the specified Config rules against the
       last known configuration state of the resources. Use StartConfigRulesE-
       valuation  when  you want to test that a rule you updated is working as
       expected. StartConfigRulesEvaluation does not re-record the latest con-
       figuration  state  for your resources. It re-runs an evaluation against
       the last known state of your resources.

       You can specify up to 25 Config rules per request.

       An existing StartConfigRulesEvaluation call  for  the  specified  rules
       must  complete  before you can call the API again. If you chose to have
       Config stream to an Amazon SNS topic, you will receive  a  ConfigRuleE-
       valuationStarted notification when the evaluation starts.

       NOTE:
          You  don't need to call the StartConfigRulesEvaluation API to run an
          evaluation for a new rule. When you create a rule, Config  evaluates
          your resources against the rule automatically.

       The  StartConfigRulesEvaluation  API  is  useful  if  you  want  to run
       on-demand evaluations, such as the following example:

       o You have a custom rule that evaluates your  IAM  resources  every  24
         hours.

       o You  update your Lambda function to add additional conditions to your
         rule.

       o Instead of waiting for the next periodic  evaluation,  you  call  the
         StartConfigRulesEvaluation API.

       o Config invokes your Lambda function and evaluates your IAM resources.

       o Your custom rule will still run periodic evaluations every 24  hours.

SYNOPSIS
            start-config-rules-evaluation
          [--config-rule-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --config-rule-names (list)
          The  list  of names of Config rules that you want to run evaluations
          for.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To run an on-demand evaluation for AWS Config rules

       The following command starts an evaluation for two AWS managed rules:

          aws configservice start-config-rules-evaluation --config-rule-names s3-bucket-versioning-enabled cloudtrail-enabled

OUTPUT
       None
