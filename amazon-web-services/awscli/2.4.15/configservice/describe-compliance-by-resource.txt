NAME
       describe-compliance-by-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Indicates  whether the specified Amazon Web Services resources are com-
       pliant. If a resource is noncompliant, this action returns  the  number
       of Config rules that the resource does not comply with.

       A  resource  is compliant if it complies with all the Config rules that
       evaluate it. It is noncompliant if it does not comply with one or  more
       of these rules.

       If  Config  has  no  current  evaluation  results  for the resource, it
       returns INSUFFICIENT_DATA . This result might indicate one of the  fol-
       lowing conditions about the rules that evaluate the resource:

       o Config has never invoked an evaluation for the rule. To check whether
         it has, use the DescribeConfigRuleEvaluationStatus action to get  the
         LastSuccessfulInvocationTime and LastFailedInvocationTime .

       o The  rule's  Lambda function is failing to send evaluation results to
         Config. Verify that the role that you assigned to your  configuration
         recorder  includes  the config:PutEvaluations permission. If the rule
         is a custom rule, verify that the Lambda execution role includes  the
         config:PutEvaluations permission.

       o The rule's Lambda function has returned NOT_APPLICABLE for all evalu-
         ation results. This can  occur  if  the  resources  were  deleted  or
         removed from the rule's scope.

       describe-compliance-by-resource  is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: ComplianceByResources

SYNOPSIS
            describe-compliance-by-resource
          [--resource-type <value>]
          [--resource-id <value>]
          [--compliance-types <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-type (string)
          The types of Amazon Web Services resources for which you  want  com-
          pliance  information  (for  example,  AWS::EC2::Instance ). For this
          action, you can specify that the resource type is an Amazon Web Ser-
          vices account by specifying AWS::::Account .

       --resource-id (string)
          The  ID  of the Amazon Web Services resource for which you want com-
          pliance information. You can specify only one resource  ID.  If  you
          specify a resource ID, you must also specify a type for ResourceType
          .

       --compliance-types (list)
          Filters the results by compliance.

          The allowed values are COMPLIANT  ,  NON_COMPLIANT  ,  and  INSUFFI-
          CIENT_DATA .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            COMPLIANT
            NON_COMPLIANT
            NOT_APPLICABLE
            INSUFFICIENT_DATA

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get compliance information for your AWS resources

       The following command  returns  compliance  information  for  each  EC2
       instance  that  is recorded by AWS Config and that violates one or more
       rules:

          aws configservice describe-compliance-by-resource --resource-type AWS::EC2::Instance --compliance-types NON_COMPLIANT

       In the output, the value for each CappedCount attribute  indicates  how
       many  rules  the  resource  violates. For example, the following output
       indicates that instance i-1a2b3c4d violates 2 rules.

       Output:

          {
              "ComplianceByResources": [
                  {
                      "ResourceType": "AWS::EC2::Instance",
                      "ResourceId": "i-1a2b3c4d",
                      "Compliance": {
                          "ComplianceContributorCount": {
                              "CappedCount": 2,
                              "CapExceeded": false
                          },
                          "ComplianceType": "NON_COMPLIANT"
                      }
                  },
                  {
                      "ResourceType": "AWS::EC2::Instance",
                      "ResourceId": "i-2a2b3c4d ",
                      "Compliance": {
                          "ComplianceContributorCount": {
                              "CappedCount": 3,
                              "CapExceeded": false
                          },
                          "ComplianceType": "NON_COMPLIANT"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       ComplianceByResources -> (list)
          Indicates whether the specified Amazon Web  Services  resource  com-
          plies with all of the Config rules that evaluate it.

          (structure)
              Indicates whether an Amazon Web Services resource that is evalu-
              ated according to one or  more  Config  rules  is  compliant.  A
              resource  is compliant if it complies with all of the rules that
              evaluate it. A resource is noncompliant if it  does  not  comply
              with one or more of these rules.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The  type of the Amazon Web Services resource that was evalu-
                 ated.

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Amazon Web Services resource  that  was  evalu-
                 ated.

              Compliance -> (structure)
                 Indicates  whether  the Amazon Web Services resource complies
                 with all of the Config rules that evaluated it.

                 ComplianceType -> (string)
                     Indicates whether an Amazon Web Services resource or Con-
                     fig rule is compliant.

                     A  resource  is  compliant if it complies with all of the
                     Config rules that evaluate it. A resource is noncompliant
                     if it does not comply with one or more of these rules.

                     A rule is compliant if all of the resources that the rule
                     evaluates comply with it. A rule is noncompliant  if  any
                     of these resources do not comply.

                     Config returns the INSUFFICIENT_DATA value when no evalu-
                     ation results are available for the Amazon  Web  Services
                     resource or Config rule.

                     For  the  Compliance data type, Config supports only COM-
                     PLIANT , NON_COMPLIANT ,  and  INSUFFICIENT_DATA  values.
                     Config  does not support the NOT_APPLICABLE value for the
                     Compliance data type.

                 ComplianceContributorCount -> (structure)
                     The number of Amazon Web  Services  resources  or  Config
                     rules that cause a result of NON_COMPLIANT , up to a max-
                     imum number.

                     CappedCount -> (integer)
                        The number of Amazon Web Services resources or  Config
                        rules  responsible  for  the current compliance of the
                        item.

                     CapExceeded -> (boolean)
                        Indicates whether the maximum count is reached.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The string that you use in a subsequent request to get the next page
          of results in a paginated response.
