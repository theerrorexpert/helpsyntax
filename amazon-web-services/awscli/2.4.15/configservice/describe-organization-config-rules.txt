NAME
       describe-organization-config-rules -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of organization config rules.

       NOTE:
          When  you  specify the limit and the next token, you receive a pagi-
          nated response. Limit and next token are not applicable if you spec-
          ify  organization config rule names. It is only applicable, when you
          request all the organization config rules.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-organization-config-rules is a paginated  operation.  Multiple
       API  calls  may  be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: OrganizationConfigRules

SYNOPSIS
            describe-organization-config-rules
          [--organization-config-rule-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --organization-config-rule-names (list)
          The  names  of organization config rules for which you want details.
          If you do not specify any names, Config returns details for all your
          organization config rules.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          Returns a list of OrganizationConfigRule objects.

          (structure)
              An organization config rule that has  information  about  config
              rules that Config creates in member accounts.

              OrganizationConfigRuleName -> (string)
                 The name that you assign to organization config rule.

              OrganizationConfigRuleArn -> (string)
                 Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of organization config rule.

              OrganizationManagedRuleMetadata -> (structure)

                 Description -> (string)
                     The  description that you provide for organization config
                     rule.

                 RuleIdentifier -> (string)
                     For organization config managed rules, a predefined iden-
                     tifier from a list. For example, IAM_PASSWORD_POLICY is a
                     managed rule. To reference a managed rule, see Using Con-
                     fig managed rules .

                 InputParameters -> (string)
                     A  string, in JSON format, that is passed to organization
                     config rule Lambda function.

                 MaximumExecutionFrequency -> (string)
                     The maximum frequency with which Config runs  evaluations
                     for  a rule. You are using an Config managed rule that is
                     triggered at a periodic frequency.

                     NOTE:
                        By default, rules with a periodic trigger  are  evalu-
                        ated  every 24 hours. To change the frequency, specify
                        a valid value for the MaximumExecutionFrequency param-
                        eter.

                 ResourceTypesScope -> (list)
                     The  type  of  the  Amazon Web Services resource that was
                     evaluated.

                     uated.

                 TagKeyScope -> (string)
                     One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is
                     a general label that acts like a category for  more  spe-
                     cific tag values.

                 TagValueScope -> (string)
                     The optional part of a key-value pair that make up a tag.
                     A value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

              OrganizationCustomRuleMetadata -> (structure)
                 An OrganizationCustomRuleMetadata object.

                 Description -> (string)
                     The  description that you provide for organization config
                     rule.

                 LambdaFunctionArn -> (string)

                     The type of notification that triggers Config to  run  an
                     evaluation  for  a  rule.  You  can specify the following
                     notification types:

                     o ConfigurationItemChangeNotification - Triggers an eval-
                       uation  when  Config delivers a configuration item as a
                       result of a resource change.

                     o OversizedConfigurationItemChangeNotification - Triggers
                       an evaluation when Config delivers an oversized config-
                       uration item. Config  may  generate  this  notification
                       type  when  a  resource  changes  and  the notification
                       exceeds the maximum size allowed by Amazon SNS.

                     o ScheduledNotification - Triggers a periodic  evaluation
                       at  the  frequency  specified  for MaximumExecutionFre-
                       quency .

                     (string)

                     config rule Lambda function.

                 MaximumExecutionFrequency -> (string)
                     The  maximum frequency with which Config runs evaluations
                     for a rule. Your custom rule  is  triggered  when  Config
                     delivers  the  configuration  snapshot. For more informa-
                     tion, see  ConfigSnapshotDeliveryProperties .

                     NOTE:

                        ated  every 24 hours. To change the frequency, specify
                        a valid value for the MaximumExecutionFrequency param-
                        eter.

                     One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is
                     a general label that acts like a category for  more  spe-
                     cific tag values.

                 TagValueScope -> (string)
                     The optional part of a key-value pair that make up a tag.
                     A value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

              ExcludedAccounts -> (list)
                 A comma-separated list of accounts excluded from organization
                 config rule.
