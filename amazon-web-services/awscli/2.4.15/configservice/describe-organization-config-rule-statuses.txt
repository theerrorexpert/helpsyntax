DESCRIBE-ORGANIZATION-CONFIG-RULE-DESCRIBE-ORGANIZATION-CONFIG-RULE-STATUSES()



NAME
       describe-organization-config-rule-statuses -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  organization  config  rule deployment status for an organiza-
       tion.

       NOTE:
          The status is not considered successful  until  organization  config
          rule  is  successfully  deployed  in all the member accounts with an
          exception of excluded accounts.

          When you specify the limit and the next token, you receive  a  pagi-
          nated response. Limit and next token are not applicable if you spec-
          ify organization config rule names. It is only applicable, when  you
          request all the organization config rules.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-organization-config-rule-statuses  is  a  paginated operation.
       Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the  entire  data
       set  of results. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-pagi-
       nate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on  a
       paginated  response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the
       results of the following query expressions:  OrganizationConfigRuleSta-
       tuses

SYNOPSIS
            describe-organization-config-rule-statuses
          [--organization-config-rule-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --organization-config-rule-names (list)
          The  names  of  organization  config rules for which you want status
          details. If you do not specify any names, Config returns details for
          all your organization Config rules.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       OrganizationConfigRuleStatuses -> (list)
          A list of OrganizationConfigRuleStatus objects.

          (structure)
              Returns the status for an organization config rule in an organi-
              zation.

              OrganizationConfigRuleName -> (string)
                 The name that you assign to organization config rule.

              OrganizationRuleStatus -> (string)
                 Indicates  deployment  status of an organization config rule.
                 When master account  calls  PutOrganizationConfigRule  action
                 for  the first time, config rule status is created in all the
                 member accounts. When master account  calls  PutOrganization-
                 ConfigRule  action for the second time, config rule status is
                 updated in all the member accounts. Additionally, config rule
                 status  is  updated  when one or more member accounts join or
                 leave an organization. Config rule status is deleted when the
                 master account deletes OrganizationConfigRule in all the mem-
                 ber accounts and disables service access for  config-multiac-
                 countsetup.amazonaws.com .

                 Config sets the state of the rule to:

                 o CREATE_SUCCESSFUL when an organization config rule has been
                   successfully created in all the member accounts.

                 o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS when an organization  config  rule  cre-
                   ation is in progress.

                 o CREATE_FAILED  when  an  organization  config rule creation
                   failed in one or more member accounts within that organiza-
                   tion.

                 o DELETE_FAILED  when  an  organization  config rule deletion
                   failed in one or more member accounts within that organiza-
                   tion.

                 o DELETE_IN_PROGRESS  when  an organization config rule dele-
                   tion is in progress.

                 o DELETE_SUCCESSFUL when an organization config rule has been
                   successfully deleted from all the member accounts.

                 o UPDATE_SUCCESSFUL when an organization config rule has been
                   successfully updated in all the member accounts.

                 o UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS when an organization config rule  update
                   is in progress.

                 o UPDATE_FAILED  when  an  organization  config  rule  update
                   failed in one or more member accounts within that organiza-
                   tion.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 An  error code that is returned when organization config rule
                 creation or deletion has failed.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 An error message indicating  that  organization  config  rule
                 creation or deletion failed due to an error.

              LastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp of the last update.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken string returned on a previous page that you use to get
          the next page of results in a paginated response.
