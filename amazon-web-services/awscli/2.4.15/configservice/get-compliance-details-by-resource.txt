NAME
       get-compliance-details-by-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  evaluation  results for the specified Amazon Web Services
       resource. The results indicate which Config rules were used to evaluate
       the  resource,  when  each rule was last used, and whether the resource
       complies with each rule.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-compliance-details-by-resource is a paginated  operation.  Multiple
       API  calls  may  be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: EvaluationResults

SYNOPSIS
            get-compliance-details-by-resource
          --resource-type <value>
          --resource-id <value>
          [--compliance-types <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-type (string)
          The type of the Amazon Web Services resource for which you want com-
          pliance information.

       --resource-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services resource for which you  want  com-
          pliance information.

       --compliance-types (list)
          Filters the results by compliance.

          The  allowed values are COMPLIANT , NON_COMPLIANT , and NOT_APPLICA-
          BLE .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            COMPLIANT
            NON_COMPLIANT
            NOT_APPLICABLE
            INSUFFICIENT_DATA

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the evaluation results for an AWS resource

       The following command returns the evaluation results for each rule with
       which the EC2 instance i-1a2b3c4d does not comply:

          aws configservice get-compliance-details-by-resource --resource-type AWS::EC2::Instance --resource-id i-1a2b3c4d --compliance-types NON_COMPLIANT

OUTPUT
       EvaluationResults -> (list)
          Indicates  whether  the  specified Amazon Web Services resource com-
          plies each Config rule.

          (structure)
              The details of an Config evaluation.  Provides  the  Amazon  Web
              Services  resource  that  was  evaluated,  the compliance of the
              resource, related time stamps, and supplementary information.

              EvaluationResultIdentifier -> (structure)
                 Uniquely identifies the evaluation result.

                 EvaluationResultQualifier -> (structure)
                     Identifies an Config rule used to evaluate an Amazon  Web
                     Services  resource,  and  provides the type and ID of the
                     evaluated resource.

                     ConfigRuleName -> (string)
                        The name of the Config rule that was used in the eval-
                        uation.

                     ResourceType -> (string)
                        The  type  of  Amazon  Web  Services resource that was
                        evaluated.

                     ResourceId -> (string)
                        The ID of the evaluated Amazon Web Services  resource.

                 OrderingTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                     The  time  of  the event that triggered the evaluation of
                     your Amazon Web Services resources. The time can indicate
                     when Config delivered a configuration item change notifi-
                     cation, or it can indicate when Config delivered the con-
                     figuration  snapshot,  depending on which event triggered
                     the evaluation.

              ComplianceType -> (string)
                 Indicates whether the Amazon Web Services  resource  complies
                 with the Config rule that evaluated it.

                 For  the EvaluationResult data type, Config supports only the
                 COMPLIANT , NON_COMPLIANT , and NOT_APPLICABLE values. Config
                 does  not support the INSUFFICIENT_DATA value for the Evalua-
                 tionResult data type.

              ResultRecordedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time when Config recorded the evaluation result.

              ConfigRuleInvokedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the Config rule evaluated the Amazon  Web  Ser-
                 vices resource.

              Annotation -> (string)
                 Supplementary information about how the evaluation determined
                 the compliance.

              ResultToken -> (string)
                 An encrypted token that associates an evaluation with an Con-
                 fig  rule. The token identifies the rule, the Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices resource being evaluated, and the event that  triggered
                 the evaluation.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The string that you use in a subsequent request to get the next page
          of results in a paginated response.
