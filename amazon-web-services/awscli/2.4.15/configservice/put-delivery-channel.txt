PUT-DELIVERY-CHANNEL()                                  PUT-DELIVERY-CHANNEL()



NAME
       put-delivery-channel -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a delivery channel object to deliver configuration information
       to an Amazon S3 bucket and Amazon SNS topic.

       Before you can create a delivery channel, you must create a  configura-
       tion recorder.

       You can use this action to change the Amazon S3 bucket or an Amazon SNS
       topic of the existing delivery channel. To change the Amazon S3  bucket
       or an Amazon SNS topic, call this action and specify the changed values
       for the S3 bucket and the SNS topic. If you specify a  different  value
       for  either  the  S3 bucket or the SNS topic, this action will keep the
       existing value for the parameter that is not changed.

       NOTE:
          You can have only one delivery channel per region in your account.

SYNOPSIS
            put-delivery-channel
          --delivery-channel <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --delivery-channel (structure)
          The configuration delivery channel object that delivers the configu-
          ration  information  to  an  Amazon  S3  bucket and to an Amazon SNS
          topic.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the delivery channel. By default, Config assigns the
              name "default" when creating the delivery channel. To change the
              delivery channel name, you must  use  the  DeleteDeliveryChannel
              action  to  delete  your  current delivery channel, and then you
              must use the PutDeliveryChannel command  to  create  a  delivery
              channel that has the desired name.

          s3BucketName -> (string)
              The  name  of the Amazon S3 bucket to which Config delivers con-
              figuration snapshots and configuration history files.

              If you specify a bucket that belongs to another Amazon Web  Ser-
              vices  account, that bucket must have policies that grant access
              permissions to Config. For more information, see Permissions for
              the Amazon S3 Bucket in the Config Developer Guide.

          s3KeyPrefix -> (string)
              The prefix for the specified Amazon S3 bucket.

          s3KmsKeyArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the Key Management Service
              (KMS ) KMS key (KMS key) used to encrypt  objects  delivered  by
              Config.  Must  belong  to  the same Region as the destination S3
              bucket.

          snsTopicARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic to  which
              Config sends notifications about configuration changes.

              If  you choose a topic from another account, the topic must have
              policies that grant  access  permissions  to  Config.  For  more
              information,  see  Permissions  for  the Amazon SNS Topic in the
              Config Developer Guide.

          configSnapshotDeliveryProperties -> (structure)
              The options for how often Config  delivers  configuration  snap-
              shots to the Amazon S3 bucket.

              deliveryFrequency -> (string)
                 The  frequency with which Config delivers configuration snap-
                 shots.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,s3BucketName=string,s3KeyPrefix=string,s3KmsKeyArn=string,snsTopicARN=string,configSnapshotDeliveryProperties={deliveryFrequency=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "name": "string",
            "s3BucketName": "string",
            "s3KeyPrefix": "string",
            "s3KmsKeyArn": "string",
            "snsTopicARN": "string",
            "configSnapshotDeliveryProperties": {
              "deliveryFrequency": "One_Hour"|"Three_Hours"|"Six_Hours"|"Twelve_Hours"|"TwentyFour_Hours"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a delivery channel

       The following command provides the settings for the delivery channel as
       JSON code:

          aws configservice put-delivery-channel --delivery-channel file://deliveryChannel.json

       The   deliveryChannel.json   file   specifies   the   delivery  channel
       attributes:

          {
              "name": "default",
              "s3BucketName": "config-bucket-123456789012",
              "snsTopicARN": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:config-topic",
              "configSnapshotDeliveryProperties": {
                  "deliveryFrequency": "Twelve_Hours"
              }
          }

       This example sets the following attributes:

       o name - The name of the  delivery  channel.  By  default,  AWS  Config
         assigns the name default to a new delivery channel.

         You  cannot  update  the  delivery  channel  name with the put-deliv-
         ery-channel command. For the steps to change the name,  see  Renaming
         the Delivery Channel.

       o s3BucketName  -  The name of the Amazon S3 bucket to which AWS Config
         delivers configuration snapshots and configuration history files.

         If you specify a bucket that belongs to  another  AWS  account,  that
         bucket  must  have policies that grant access permissions to AWS Con-
         fig. For more information, see Permissions for the Amazon S3  Bucket.

       o snsTopicARN  - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic
         to which AWS Config sends notifications about configuration  changes.

         If you choose a topic from another account, the topic must have poli-
         cies that grant access permissions to AWS Config. For  more  informa-
         tion, see Permissions for the Amazon SNS Topic.

       o configSnapshotDeliveryProperties  -  Contains  the  deliveryFrequency
         attribute, which sets how often  AWS  Config  delivers  configuration
         snapshots  and  how  often it invokes evaluations for periodic Config
         rules.

       If the command succeeds, AWS Config returns no output.  To  verify  the
       settings  of  your delivery channel, run the describe-delivery-channels
       command.

OUTPUT
       None
