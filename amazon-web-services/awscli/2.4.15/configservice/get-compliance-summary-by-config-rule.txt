NAME
       get-compliance-summary-by-config-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the number of Config rules that are compliant and noncompliant,
       up to a maximum of 25 for each.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-compliance-summary-by-config-rule
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the compliance summary for your AWS Config rules

       The following command returns the number of rules  that  are  compliant
       and the number that are noncompliant:

          aws configservice get-compliance-summary-by-config-rule

       In  the  output, the value for each CappedCount attribute indicates how
       many rules are compliant or noncompliant.

       Output:

          {
              "ComplianceSummary": {
                  "NonCompliantResourceCount": {
                      "CappedCount": 3,
                      "CapExceeded": false
                  },
                  "ComplianceSummaryTimestamp": 1452204131.493,
                  "CompliantResourceCount": {
                      "CappedCount": 2,
                      "CapExceeded": false
                  }
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       ComplianceSummary -> (structure)
          The number of Config rules that are compliant and  the  number  that
          are noncompliant, up to a maximum of 25 for each.

          CompliantResourceCount -> (structure)
              The number of Config rules or Amazon Web Services resources that
              are compliant, up to a maximum of  25  for  rules  and  100  for
              resources.

              CappedCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of Amazon Web Services resources or Config rules
                 responsible for the current compliance of the item.

              CapExceeded -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the maximum count is reached.

          NonCompliantResourceCount -> (structure)
              The number of Config rules or Amazon Web Services resources that
              are  noncompliant,  up  to a maximum of 25 for rules and 100 for
              resources.

              CappedCount -> (integer)
                 The number of Amazon Web Services resources or  Config  rules
                 responsible for the current compliance of the item.

              CapExceeded -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the maximum count is reached.

          ComplianceSummaryTimestamp -> (timestamp)
