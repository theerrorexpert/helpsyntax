DESCRIBE-CONFIG-RULE-EVALUATION-STATUSDESCRIBE-CONFIG-RULE-EVALUATION-STATUS()



NAME
       describe-config-rule-evaluation-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  status  information for each of your Config managed rules. The
       status includes information such as the last time  Config  invoked  the
       rule,  the  last time Config failed to invoke the rule, and the related
       error for the last failure.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-config-rule-evaluation-status is a paginated operation. Multi-
       ple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: ConfigRulesEvaluationStatus

SYNOPSIS
            describe-config-rule-evaluation-status
          [--config-rule-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --config-rule-names (list)
          The  name  of  the  Config  managed  rules for which you want status
          information. If you do not specify any names, Config returns  status
          information for all Config managed rules that you use.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get status information for an AWS Config rule

       The following command returns the status information for an AWS  Config
       rule named MyConfigRule:

          aws configservice describe-config-rule-evaluation-status --config-rule-names MyConfigRule

       Output:

          {
              "ConfigRulesEvaluationStatus": [
                  {
                      "ConfigRuleArn": "arn:aws:config:us-east-1:123456789012:config-rule/config-rule-abcdef",
                      "FirstActivatedTime": 1450311703.844,
                      "ConfigRuleId": "config-rule-abcdef",
                      "LastSuccessfulInvocationTime": 1450314643.156,
                      "ConfigRuleName": "MyConfigRule"
                  }
              ]
          }

              LastSuccessfulEvaluationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time that Config last successfully evaluated your Amazon
                 Web Services resources against the rule.

              LastFailedEvaluationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that Config last failed to evaluate your Amazon  Web
                 Services resources against the rule.

              FirstActivatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that you first activated the Config rule.

              LastDeactivatedTime -> (timestamp)

              FirstEvaluationStarted -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether Config has evaluated your resources against
                 the rule at least once.

                 o true -  Config  has  evaluated  your  Amazon  Web  Services
                   resources against the rule at least once.

                 o false - Config has not once finished evaluating your Amazon
                   Web Services resources against the rule.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The string that you use in a subsequent request to get the next page
