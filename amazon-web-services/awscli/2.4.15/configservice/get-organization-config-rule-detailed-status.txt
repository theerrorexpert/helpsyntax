NAME
       get-organization-config-rule-detailed-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  detailed status for each member account within an organization
       for a given organization config rule.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-organization-config-rule-detailed-status is a paginated  operation.
       Multiple  API  calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data
       set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the  --no-pagi-
       nate  argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a
       paginated response, the --query argument must  extract  data  from  the
       results  of  the following query expressions: OrganizationConfigRuleDe-
       tailedStatus

SYNOPSIS
            get-organization-config-rule-detailed-status
          --organization-config-rule-name <value>
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --organization-config-rule-name (string)
          The name of organization config  rule  for  which  you  want  status
          details for member accounts.

       --filters (structure)
          A StatusDetailFilters object.

          AccountId -> (string)
              The  12-digit account ID of the member account within an organi-
              zation.

          MemberAccountRuleStatus -> (string)
              Indicates deployment  status  for  config  rule  in  the  member
              account.  When  master  account  calls PutOrganizationConfigRule
              action for the first time, config rule status is created in  the
              member  account. When master account calls PutOrganizationConfi-
              gRule action for the second time, config rule status is  updated
              in  the  member  account. Config rule status is deleted when the
              master account deletes OrganizationConfigRule and disables  ser-
              vice access for config-multiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com .

              Config sets the state of the rule to:

              o CREATE_SUCCESSFUL  when  config  rule  has been created in the
                member account.

              o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS when config rule is being  created  in  the
                member account.

              o CREATE_FAILED when config rule creation has failed in the mem-
                ber account.

              o DELETE_FAILED when config rule deletion has failed in the mem-
                ber account.

              o DELETE_IN_PROGRESS  when  config  rule is being deleted in the
                member account.

              o DELETE_SUCCESSFUL when config rule has  been  deleted  in  the
                member account.

              o UPDATE_SUCCESSFUL  when  config  rule  has been updated in the
                member account.

              o UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS when config rule is being  updated  in  the
                member account.

              o UPDATE_FAILED when config rule deletion has failed in the mem-
                ber account.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AccountId=string,MemberAccountRuleStatus=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AccountId": "string",
            "MemberAccountRuleStatus": "CREATE_SUCCESSFUL"|"CREATE_IN_PROGRESS"|"CREATE_FAILED"|"DELETE_SUCCESSFUL"|"DELETE_FAILED"|"DELETE_IN_PROGRESS"|"UPDATE_SUCCESSFUL"|"UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS"|"UPDATE_FAILED"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              Organization  config  rule  creation  or deletion status in each
              member account. This includes the name of the rule, the  status,
              error  code and error message when the rule creation or deletion
              failed.

              AccountId -> (string)
                 The 12-digit account ID of a member account.

              ConfigRuleName -> (string)
                 The name of config rule deployed in the member account.

              MemberAccountRuleStatus -> (string)
                 Indicates deployment status for config  rule  in  the  member
                 account.  When master account calls PutOrganizationConfigRule
                 action for the first time, config rule status is  created  in
                 the  member  account.  When master account calls PutOrganiza-
                 tionConfigRule action for the second time, config rule status
                 is  updated  in  the  member  account.  Config rule status is
                 deleted when the master  account  deletes  OrganizationConfi-
                 gRule   and   disables  service  access  for  config-multiac-
                 countsetup.amazonaws.com .

                 Config sets the state of the rule to:

                 o CREATE_SUCCESSFUL when config rule has been created in  the
                   member account.

                 o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS when config rule is being created in the
                   member account.

                 o CREATE_FAILED when config rule creation has failed  in  the
                   member account.

                   member account.

                 o DELETE_SUCCESSFUL  when config rule has been deleted in the
                   member account.

                 o UPDATE_SUCCESSFUL when config rule has been updated in  the
                   member account.

                 o UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS when config rule is being updated in the
                   member account.

                 o UPDATE_FAILED when config rule deletion has failed  in  the
                   member account.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 An  error  code that is returned when config rule creation or
                 deletion failed in the member account.

                 An error message indicating that config rule account creation
                 or deletion has failed due to an error in the member account.

              LastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp of the last status update.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken string returned on a previous page that you use to get
          the next page of results in a paginated response.
