NAME
       get-compliance-details-by-config-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  evaluation  results  for  the  specified Config rule. The
       results indicate which Amazon Web Services resources were evaluated  by
       the  rule,  when  each  resource  was  last evaluated, and whether each
       resource complies with the rule.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-compliance-details-by-config-rule is a paginated operation.  Multi-
       ple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: EvaluationResults

SYNOPSIS
            get-compliance-details-by-config-rule
          --config-rule-name <value>
          [--compliance-types <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --config-rule-name (string)
          The  name  of the Config rule for which you want compliance informa-
          tion.

       --compliance-types (list)
          Filters the results by compliance.

          The allowed values are COMPLIANT , NON_COMPLIANT , and  NOT_APPLICA-
          BLE .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            COMPLIANT
            NON_COMPLIANT
            NOT_APPLICABLE
            INSUFFICIENT_DATA

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the evaluation results for an AWS Config rule

       The following command returns the evaluation results  for  all  of  the
       resources that don't comply with an AWS Config rule named InstanceType-
       sAreT2micro:

          aws configservice get-compliance-details-by-config-rule --config-rule-name InstanceTypesAreT2micro --compliance-types NON_COMPLIANT

OUTPUT
       EvaluationResults -> (list)
          Indicates whether the Amazon Web Services resource complies with the
          specified Config rule.

          (structure)
              The  details  of  an  Config evaluation. Provides the Amazon Web
              Services resource that was  evaluated,  the  compliance  of  the
              resource, related time stamps, and supplementary information.

              EvaluationResultIdentifier -> (structure)
                 Uniquely identifies the evaluation result.

                 EvaluationResultQualifier -> (structure)
                     Identifies  an Config rule used to evaluate an Amazon Web
                     Services resource, and provides the type and  ID  of  the
                     evaluated resource.

                     ConfigRuleName -> (string)
                        The name of the Config rule that was used in the eval-
                        uation.

                     ResourceType -> (string)
                        The type of Amazon  Web  Services  resource  that  was
                        evaluated.

                     ResourceId -> (string)
                        The  ID of the evaluated Amazon Web Services resource.

                 OrderingTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                     The time of the event that triggered  the  evaluation  of
                     your Amazon Web Services resources. The time can indicate
                     when Config delivered a configuration item change notifi-
                     cation, or it can indicate when Config delivered the con-
                     figuration snapshot, depending on which  event  triggered
                     the evaluation.

              ComplianceType -> (string)
                 Indicates  whether  the Amazon Web Services resource complies
                 with the Config rule that evaluated it.

                 For the EvaluationResult data type, Config supports only  the
                 COMPLIANT , NON_COMPLIANT , and NOT_APPLICABLE values. Config
                 does not support the INSUFFICIENT_DATA value for the  Evalua-
                 tionResult data type.

              ResultRecordedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time when Config recorded the evaluation result.

              ConfigRuleInvokedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  when the Config rule evaluated the Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices resource.

              Annotation -> (string)
                 Supplementary information about how the evaluation determined
                 the compliance.

              ResultToken -> (string)
                 An encrypted token that associates an evaluation with an Con-
                 fig rule. The token identifies the rule, the Amazon Web  Ser-
                 vices  resource being evaluated, and the event that triggered
                 the evaluation.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The string that you use in a subsequent request to get the next page
          of results in a paginated response.
