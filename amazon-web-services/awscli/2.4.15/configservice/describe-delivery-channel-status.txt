NAME
       describe-delivery-channel-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  current  status  of  the specified delivery channel. If a
       delivery channel is not specified, this action returns the current sta-
       tus of all delivery channels associated with the account.

       NOTE:
          Currently,  you  can specify only one delivery channel per region in
          your account.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-delivery-channel-status
          [--delivery-channel-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --delivery-channel-names (list)
          A list of delivery channel names.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
