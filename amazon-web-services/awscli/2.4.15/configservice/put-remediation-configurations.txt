PUT-REMEDIATION-CONFIGURATIONS()              PUT-REMEDIATION-CONFIGURATIONS()



NAME
       put-remediation-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  or  updates  the remediation configuration with a specific Config
       rule with the selected target or action. The API creates  the  Remedia-
       tionConfiguration  object  for  the  Config  rule. The Config rule must
       already exist for you to add a remediation  configuration.  The  target
       (SSM document) must exist and have permissions to use the target.

       NOTE:
          If  you  make backward incompatible changes to the SSM document, you
          must call this again to ensure the remediations can run.

          This API does not support adding remediation configurations for ser-
          vice-linked  Config  Rules  such  as  Organization Config rules, the
          rules deployed by conformance packs, and rules  deployed  by  Amazon
          Web Services Security Hub.

SYNOPSIS
            put-remediation-configurations
          --remediation-configurations <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --remediation-configurations (list)
          A list of remediation configuration objects.

          (structure)
              An object that represents the details about the remediation con-
              figuration that includes the remediation action, parameters, and
              data to execute the action.

              ConfigRuleName -> (string)
                 The name of the Config rule.

              TargetType -> (string)
                 The  type  of  the  target.  Target executes remediation. For
                 example, SSM document.

              TargetId -> (string)
                 Target ID is the name of the public document.

              TargetVersion -> (string)
                 Version of the target. For example, version of the SSM  docu-
                 ment.

                 NOTE:
                     If you make backward incompatible changes to the SSM doc-
                     ument,  you  must  call  PutRemediationConfiguration  API
                     again to ensure the remediations can run.

              Parameters -> (map)
                 An object of the RemediationParameterValue.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     The  value  is  either  a  dynamic  (resource) value or a
                     static value. You must select either a dynamic value or a
                     static value.

                     ResourceValue -> (structure)
                        The value is dynamic and changes at run-time.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value is a resource ID.

                     StaticValue -> (structure)
                        The value is static and does not change at run-time.

                        Values -> (list)
                            A  list  of  values.  For  example, the ARN of the
                            assumed role.

                            (string)

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of a resource.

              Automatic -> (boolean)
                 The remediation is triggered automatically.

              ExecutionControls -> (structure)
                 An ExecutionControls object.

                 SsmControls -> (structure)
                     A SsmControls object.

                     ConcurrentExecutionRatePercentage -> (integer)
                        The maximum percentage of remediation actions  allowed
                        to  run in parallel on the non-compliant resources for
                        that specific rule. You can specify a percentage, such
                        as 10%. The default value is 10.

                     ErrorPercentage -> (integer)
                        The  percentage  of errors that are allowed before SSM
                        stops running automations on  non-compliant  resources
                        for  that  specific rule. You can specify a percentage
                        of errors, for example 10%. If you do not  specifiy  a
                        percentage,  the  default  is 50%. For example, if you
                        set the ErrorPercentage to 40%  for  10  non-compliant
                        resources, then SSM stops running the automations when
                        the fifth error is received.

              MaximumAutomaticAttempts -> (integer)
                 The maximum number of failed attempts  for  auto-remediation.
                 If you do not select a number, the default is 5.

                 For  example,  if  you  specify MaximumAutomaticAttempts as 5
                 with RetryAttemptSeconds as 50 seconds,  Config  will  put  a
                 RemediationException  on your behalf for the failing resource
                 after the 5th failed attempt within 50 seconds.

              RetryAttemptSeconds -> (long)
                 Maximum time in seconds that Config runs auto-remediation. If
                 you do not select a number, the default is 60 seconds.

                 For example, if you specify RetryAttemptSeconds as 50 seconds
                 and MaximumAutomaticAttempts as 5, Config will run auto-reme-
                 diations  5 times within 50 seconds before throwing an excep-
                 tion.

              Arn -> (string)
                 Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of remediation configuration.

              CreatedByService -> (string)
                 Name of the service that owns the  service  linked  rule,  if
                 applicable.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                        NOTE:

                            SSM document, you must call PutRemediationConfigu-
                            ration API again to ensure  the  remediations  can
                            run.

                               resources for that specific rule. You can spec-
                               ify a percentage,  such  as  10%.  The  default
                               value is 10.

                        will put a RemediationException on your behalf for the
                        failing resource after the 5th failed  attempt  within
                        50 seconds.

                     RetryAttemptSeconds -> (long)
                        Maximum time in seconds that Config runs auto-remedia-
                        tion. If you do not select a number, the default is 60
                        seconds.

                        seconds and MaximumAutomaticAttempts as 5, Config will
