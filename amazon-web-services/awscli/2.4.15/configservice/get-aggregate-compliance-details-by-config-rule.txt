GET-AGGREGATE-COMPLIANCE-DETAGET-AGGREGATE-COMPLIANCE-DETAILS-BY-CONFIG-RULE()



NAME
       get-aggregate-compliance-details-by-config-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the evaluation results for the specified Config rule for a spe-
       cific resource in a rule. The results indicate which  Amazon  Web  Ser-
       vices resources were evaluated by the rule, when each resource was last
       evaluated, and whether each resource complies with the rule.

       NOTE:
          The results can return an empty result page. But if you have a next-
          Token , the results are displayed on the next page.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-aggregate-compliance-details-by-config-rule  is  a paginated opera-
       tion. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the  entire
       data  set  of  results.  You  can  disable  pagination by providing the
       --no-paginate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argu-
       ment  on  a  paginated response, the --query argument must extract data
       from the results of the following query  expressions:  AggregateEvalua-
       tionResults

SYNOPSIS
            get-aggregate-compliance-details-by-config-rule
          --configuration-aggregator-name <value>
          --config-rule-name <value>
          --account-id <value>
          --aws-region <value>
          [--compliance-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --configuration-aggregator-name (string)
          The name of the configuration aggregator.

       --config-rule-name (string)
          The  name  of the Config rule for which you want compliance informa-
          tion.

       --account-id (string)
          The 12-digit account ID of the source account.

       --aws-region (string)
          The source region from where the data is aggregated.

       --compliance-type (string)
          The resource compliance status.

          NOTE:
              For  the  GetAggregateComplianceDetailsByConfigRuleRequest  data
              type,  Config  supports  only  the COMPLIANT and NON_COMPLIANT .
              Config does not support the NOT_APPLICABLE and INSUFFICIENT_DATA
              values.

          Possible values:

          o COMPLIANT

          o NON_COMPLIANT

          o NOT_APPLICABLE

          o INSUFFICIENT_DATA

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          Returns an AggregateEvaluationResults object.

          (structure)
              The details of an Config evaluation for an account ID and region
              in an aggregator. Provides the Amazon Web Services resource that

                     Services resource, and provides the type and  ID  of  the
                     evaluated resource.

                     ConfigRuleName -> (string)

                        The type of Amazon  Web  Services  resource  that  was

                     The time of the event that triggered  the  evaluation  of
                     your Amazon Web Services resources. The time can indicate
                     when Config delivered a configuration item change notifi-
                     cation, or it can indicate when Config delivered the con-
                     figuration snapshot, depending on which  event  triggered
                     the evaluation.

                 The 12-digit account ID of the source account.

              AwsRegion -> (string)
                 The source region from where the data is aggregated.
