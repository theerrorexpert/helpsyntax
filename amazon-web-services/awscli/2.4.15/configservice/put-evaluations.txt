PUT-EVALUATIONS()                                            PUT-EVALUATIONS()



NAME
       put-evaluations -

DESCRIPTION
       Used  by  an  Lambda  function to deliver evaluation results to Config.
       This action is required in every Lambda function that is invoked by  an
       Config rule.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-evaluations
          [--evaluations <value>]
          --result-token <value>
          [--test-mode | --no-test-mode]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --evaluations (list)
          The  assessments  that the Lambda function performs. Each evaluation
          identifies an Amazon Web Services resource and indicates whether  it
          complies with the Config rule that invokes the Lambda function.

          (structure)
              Identifies an Amazon Web Services resource and indicates whether
              it complies with the Config rule that it was evaluated  against.

              ComplianceResourceType -> (string)
                 The  type of Amazon Web Services resource that was evaluated.

              ComplianceResourceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Amazon Web Services resource  that  was  evalu-
                 ated.

              ComplianceType -> (string)
                 Indicates  whether  the Amazon Web Services resource complies
                 with the Config rule that it was evaluated against.

                 For the Evaluation data type, Config supports only  the  COM-
                 PLIANT  ,  NON_COMPLIANT  , and NOT_APPLICABLE values. Config
                 does not support the INSUFFICIENT_DATA value  for  this  data
                 type.

                 Similarly,  Config  does  not accept INSUFFICIENT_DATA as the
                 value for ComplianceType from a PutEvaluations  request.  For
                 example,  an  Lambda function for a custom Config rule cannot
                 pass an INSUFFICIENT_DATA value to Config.

              Annotation -> (string)
                 Supplementary information about how the evaluation determined
                 the compliance.

              OrderingTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  of  the event in Config that triggered the evalua-
                 tion. For event-based evaluations, the  time  indicates  when
                 Config  created  the  configuration  item  that triggered the
                 evaluation. For periodic evaluations, the time indicates when
                 Config  triggered  the  evaluation  at the frequency that you
                 specified (for example, every 24 hours).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ComplianceResourceType=string,ComplianceResourceId=string,ComplianceType=string,Annotation=string,OrderingTimestamp=timestamp ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ComplianceResourceType": "string",
              "ComplianceResourceId": "string",
              "ComplianceType": "COMPLIANT"|"NON_COMPLIANT"|"NOT_APPLICABLE"|"INSUFFICIENT_DATA",
              "Annotation": "string",
              "OrderingTimestamp": timestamp
            }
            ...
          ]

       --result-token (string)
          An encrypted token that associates  an  evaluation  with  an  Config
          rule.  Identifies  the rule and the event that triggered the evalua-
          tion.

       --test-mode | --no-test-mode (boolean)
          Use this parameter to specify a test run for  PutEvaluations  .  You
          can  verify  whether  your  Lambda  function will deliver evaluation
          results to Config. No updates occur to  your  existing  evaluations,
          and evaluation results are not sent to Config.

          NOTE:
              When  TestMode  is true , PutEvaluations doesn't require a valid
              value for the ResultToken parameter, but  the  value  cannot  be
              null.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FailedEvaluations -> (list)
          Requests that failed because of a client or server error.

          (structure)
              Identifies an Amazon Web Services resource and indicates whether
              it complies with the Config rule that it was evaluated  against.

              ComplianceResourceType -> (string)
                 The  type of Amazon Web Services resource that was evaluated.

              ComplianceResourceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Amazon Web Services resource  that  was  evalu-
                 ated.

              ComplianceType -> (string)
                 Indicates  whether  the Amazon Web Services resource complies
                 with the Config rule that it was evaluated against.

                 For the Evaluation data type, Config supports only  the  COM-
                 PLIANT  ,  NON_COMPLIANT  , and NOT_APPLICABLE values. Config
                 does not support the INSUFFICIENT_DATA value  for  this  data
                 type.

                 Similarly,  Config  does  not accept INSUFFICIENT_DATA as the
                 value for ComplianceType from a PutEvaluations  request.  For
                 example,  an  Lambda function for a custom Config rule cannot
                 pass an INSUFFICIENT_DATA value to Config.

              Annotation -> (string)
                 Supplementary information about how the evaluation determined
                 the compliance.

              OrderingTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  of  the event in Config that triggered the evalua-
                 tion. For event-based evaluations, the  time  indicates  when
                 Config  created  the  configuration  item  that triggered the
                 evaluation. For periodic evaluations, the time indicates when
                 Config  triggered  the  evaluation  at the frequency that you
                 specified (for example, every 24 hours).
