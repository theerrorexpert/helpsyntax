SYNOPSIS
            put-aggregation-authorization
          --authorized-account-id <value>
          --authorized-aws-region <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --authorized-account-id (string)
          The 12-digit account ID of the account authorized to aggregate data.

       --authorized-aws-region (string)
          The region authorized to collect aggregated data.

       --tags (list)
          An array of tag object.

          (structure)
              The  tags  for  the  resource.  The metadata that you apply to a
              resource to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag con-
              sists  of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.
              Tag keys can have a maximum character length of 128  characters,
              and tag values can have a maximum length of 256 characters.

              Key -> (string)
                 One  part  of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  optional  part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AggregationAuthorization -> (structure)
          Returns an AggregationAuthorization object.

          AggregationAuthorizationArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the aggregation object.

          AuthorizedAccountId -> (string)
              The 12-digit account ID of the account authorized  to  aggregate
              data.

          AuthorizedAwsRegion -> (string)
              The region authorized to collect aggregated data.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              The time stamp when the aggregation authorization was created.
