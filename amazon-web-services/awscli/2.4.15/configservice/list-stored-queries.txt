LIST-STORED-QUERIES()                                    LIST-STORED-QUERIES()



NAME
       list-stored-queries -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the stored queries for a single Amazon Web Services account and a
       single Amazon Web Services Region. The default is 100.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-stored-queries
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          The nextToken string returned in a previous request that you use  to
          request the next page of results in a paginated response.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to be returned with a single call.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       StoredQueryMetadata -> (list)
          A list of StoredQueryMetadata objects.

          (structure)
              Returns details of a specific query.

              QueryId -> (string)
                 The ID of the query.

              QueryArn -> (string)
                 Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the  query.  For  example,
                 arn:partition:ser-
                 vice:region:account-id:resource-type/resource-name/resource-id.

              QueryName -> (string)
                 The name of the query.

              Description -> (string)
                 A unique description for the query.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the previous paginated request didn't return all of the remaining
          results, the response object's NextToken parameter value is set to a
          token. To retrieve the next set of results, call this  action  again
          and  assign  that token to the request object's NextToken parameter.
          If there are no remaining results, the  previous  response  object's
          NextToken parameter is set to null .
