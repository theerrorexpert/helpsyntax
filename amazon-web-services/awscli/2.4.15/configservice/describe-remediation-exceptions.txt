NAME
       describe-remediation-exceptions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  details of one or more remediation exceptions. A detailed
       view of a remediation exception for a set of resources that includes an
       explanation  of  an  exception  and the time when the exception will be
       deleted. When you specify the limit and the next token, you  receive  a
       paginated response.

       NOTE:
          Config  generates a remediation exception when a problem occurs exe-
          cuting a remediation action  to  a  specific  resource.  Remediation
          exceptions blocks auto-remediation until the exception is cleared.

          When  you  specify the limit and the next token, you receive a pagi-
          nated response.

          Limit and next token are not applicable if you request resources  in
          batch. It is only applicable, when you request all resources.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-remediation-exceptions
          --config-rule-name <value>
          [--resource-keys <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --config-rule-name (string)
          The name of the Config rule.

       --resource-keys (list)
          An  exception  list  of resource exception keys to be processed with
          the current request. Config adds exception for  each  resource  key.
          For example, Config adds 3 exceptions for 3 resource keys.

          (structure)
              The  details  that  identify a resource within Config, including
              the resource type and resource ID.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of a resource.

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the resource (for example., sg-xxxxxx).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ResourceType=string,ResourceId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ResourceType": "string",
              "ResourceId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of  RemediationExceptionResourceKey  returned  on
          each  page.  The  default  is  25. If you specify 0, Config uses the
          default.

       --next-token (string)
          The nextToken string returned in a previous request that you use  to
          request the next page of results in a paginated response.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RemediationExceptions -> (list)
          Returns a list of remediation exception objects.

          (structure)
              An  object  that  represents  the  details about the remediation
              exception. The details include the rule name, an explanation  of
              an  exception,  the time when the exception will be deleted, the
              resource ID, and resource type.

              ConfigRuleName -> (string)
                 The name of the Config rule.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of a resource.

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the resource (for example., sg-xxxxxx).

              Message -> (string)
                 An explanation of an remediation exception.

              ExpirationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the remediation exception will be deleted.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken string returned in a previous request that you use  to
          request the next page of results in a paginated response.
