NAME
       describe-retention-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  details  of  one or more retention configurations. If the
       retention configuration name is not specified, this action returns  the
       details for all the retention configurations for that account.

       NOTE:
          Currently,  Config  supports  only  one  retention configuration per
          region in your account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-retention-configurations is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple
       API  calls  may  be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: RetentionConfigurations

SYNOPSIS
            describe-retention-configurations
          [--retention-configuration-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --retention-configuration-names (list)
          A  list  of  names  of  retention  configurations for which you want
          details. If you do not specify a name, Config  returns  details  for
          all the retention configurations for that account.

          NOTE:
              Currently,  Config supports only one retention configuration per
              region in your account.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RetentionConfigurations -> (list)
          Returns a retention configuration object.

          (structure)
              An object with the name of the retention configuration  and  the
              retention  period  in  days. The object stores the configuration
              for data retention in Config.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the retention configuration object.

              RetentionPeriodInDays -> (integer)
                 Number of days Config stores your historical information.

                 NOTE:
                     Currently, only applicable to the configuration item his-
                     tory.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken string returned on a previous page that you use to get
          the next page of results in a paginated response.
