DESCRIBE-CONFIG-RULES()                                DESCRIBE-CONFIG-RULES()



NAME
       describe-config-rules -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns details about your Config rules.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-config-rules  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: ConfigRules

SYNOPSIS
            describe-config-rules
          [--config-rule-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --config-rule-names (list)
          The names of the Config rules for which you want details. If you  do
          not specify any names, Config returns details for all your rules.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get details for an AWS Config rule

       The  following  command  returns  details  for an AWS Config rule named
       InstanceTypesAreT2micro:

          aws configservice describe-config-rules --config-rule-names InstanceTypesAreT2micro

OUTPUT
       ConfigRules -> (list)
          The details about your Config rules.

          (structure)
              An Config rule represents an Lambda function that you create for
              a  custom  rule  or  a predefined function for an Config managed
              rule. The  function  evaluates  configuration  items  to  assess
              whether  your  Amazon  Web  Services  resources comply with your
              desired  configurations.  This  function  can  run  when  Config
              detects  a  configuration  change  to  an  Amazon  Web  Services
              resource and at a periodic frequency that you choose (for  exam-
              ple, every 24 hours).

              NOTE:
                 You  can  use the Amazon Web Services CLI and Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices SDKs if you want to create a rule that triggers evalua-
                 tions  for your resources when Config delivers the configura-
                 tion snapshot. For more information,  see   ConfigSnapshotDe-
                 liveryProperties .

              For  more  information  about developing and using Config rules,
              see Evaluating Amazon Web Services resource Configurations  with
              Config in the Config Developer Guide .

              ConfigRuleName -> (string)
                 The  name  that  you  assign  to the Config rule. The name is
                 required if you are adding a new rule.

              ConfigRuleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Config rule.

              ConfigRuleId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Config rule.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description that you provide for the Config rule.

              Scope -> (structure)
                 Defines which resources can trigger  an  evaluation  for  the
                 rule.  The  scope  can  include one or more resource types, a
                 combination of one resource type and one resource  ID,  or  a
                 combination  of  a tag key and value. Specify a scope to con-
                 strain the resources that can trigger an evaluation  for  the
                 rule.  If  you  do not specify a scope, evaluations are trig-
                 gered when any resource in the recording group changes.

                 NOTE:
                     The scope can be empty.

                 ComplianceResourceTypes -> (list)
                     The resource types of  only  those  Amazon  Web  Services
                     resources  that you want to trigger an evaluation for the
                     rule. You can only specify one type if you also specify a
                     resource ID for ComplianceResourceId .

                     (string)

                 TagKey -> (string)
                     The tag key that is applied to only those Amazon Web Ser-
                     vices resources that you want to  trigger  an  evaluation
                     for the rule.

                 TagValue -> (string)
                     The  tag  value applied to only those Amazon Web Services
                     resources that you want to trigger an evaluation for  the
                     rule. If you specify a value for TagValue , you must also
                     specify a value for TagKey .

                 ComplianceResourceId -> (string)
                     The ID of the only Amazon Web Services resource that  you
                     want  to trigger an evaluation for the rule. If you spec-
                     ify a resource ID, you must specify one resource type for
                     ComplianceResourceTypes .

              Source -> (structure)
                 Provides  the  rule  owner (Amazon Web Services or customer),
                 the rule identifier, and the  notifications  that  cause  the
                 function to evaluate your Amazon Web Services resources.

                 Owner -> (string)
                     Indicates  whether  Amazon  Web  Services or the customer
                     owns and manages the Config rule.

                 SourceIdentifier -> (string)
                     For Config managed rules, a predefined identifier from  a
                     list. For example, IAM_PASSWORD_POLICY is a managed rule.
                     To reference a managed rule,  see  Using  Config  managed
                     rules .

                     For  custom  rules, the identifier is the Amazon Resource
                     Name  (ARN)  of  the  rule's  Lambda  function,  such  as
                     arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:123456789012:function:cus-
                     tom_rule_name .

                 SourceDetails -> (list)
                     Provides the source and type of  the  event  that  causes
                     Config to evaluate your Amazon Web Services resources.

                     (structure)
                        Provides the source and the message types that trigger
                        Config to evaluate your Amazon Web Services  resources
                        against  a  rule.  It also provides the frequency with
                        which you want Config to run evaluations for the  rule
                        if  the  trigger type is periodic. You can specify the
                        parameter values  for  SourceDetail  only  for  custom
                        rules.

                        EventSource -> (string)
                            The  source  of  the  event, such as an Amazon Web
                            Services service, that triggers Config to evaluate
                            your Amazon Web Services resources.

                        MessageType -> (string)
                            The  type  of notification that triggers Config to
                            run an evaluation for a rule. You can specify  the
                            following notification types:

                            o ConfigurationItemChangeNotification  -  Triggers
                              an evaluation when Config delivers a  configura-
                              tion item as a result of a resource change.

                            o OversizedConfigurationItemChangeNotification   -
                              Triggers an evaluation when Config  delivers  an
                              oversized  configuration item. Config may gener-
                              ate  this  notification  type  when  a  resource
                              changes and the notification exceeds the maximum
                              size allowed by Amazon SNS.

                            o ScheduledNotification  -  Triggers  a   periodic
                              evaluation  at the frequency specified for Maxi-
                              mumExecutionFrequency .

                            o ConfigurationSnapshotDeliveryCompleted  -  Trig-
                              gers  a periodic evaluation when Config delivers
                              a configuration snapshot.

                            If you want your custom rule to  be  triggered  by
                            configuration  changes,  specify  two SourceDetail
                            objects, one for  ConfigurationItemChangeNotifica-
                            tion   and   one  for  OversizedConfigurationItem-
                            ChangeNotification .

                        MaximumExecutionFrequency -> (string)
                            The frequency at which  you  want  Config  to  run
                            evaluations  for  a  custom  rule  with a periodic
                            trigger. If you specify a value for  MaximumExecu-
                            tionFrequency  ,  then  MessageType  must  use the
                            ScheduledNotification value.

                            NOTE:
                               By default, rules with a periodic  trigger  are
                               evaluated  every  24  hours. To change the fre-
                               quency, specify a valid  value  for  the  Maxi-
                               mumExecutionFrequency parameter.

                               Based  on  the  valid  value you choose, Config
                               runs evaluations once for each valid value. For
                               example,  if  you  choose  Three_Hours , Config
                               runs evaluations once  every  three  hours.  In
                               this case, Three_Hours is the frequency of this
                               rule.

              InputParameters -> (string)
                 A string, in JSON format, that is passed to the  Config  rule
                 Lambda function.

              MaximumExecutionFrequency -> (string)
                 The  maximum frequency with which Config runs evaluations for
                 a rule. You can specify a value for MaximumExecutionFrequency
                 when:

                 o You are using an Config managed rule that is triggered at a
                   periodic frequency.

                 o Your custom rule is triggered when Config delivers the con-
                   figuration snapshot. For more information, see  ConfigSnap-
                   shotDeliveryProperties .

                 NOTE:
                     By default, rules with a periodic trigger  are  evaluated
                     every  24 hours. To change the frequency, specify a valid
                     value for the MaximumExecutionFrequency parameter.

              ConfigRuleState -> (string)
                 Indicates whether the Config rule is active or  is  currently
                 being  deleted by Config. It can also indicate the evaluation
                 status for the Config rule.

                 Config sets the state of the rule to  EVALUATING  temporarily
                 after you use the StartConfigRulesEvaluation request to eval-
                 uate your resources against the Config rule.

                 Config sets the state of the rule to DELETING_RESULTS  tempo-
                 rarily  after  you use the DeleteEvaluationResults request to
                 delete the current evaluation results for the Config rule.

                 Config temporarily sets the state of a rule to DELETING after
                 you  use  the  DeleteConfigRule  request  to delete the rule.
                 After Config deletes the rule, the rule and all of its evalu-
                 ations are erased and are no longer available.

              CreatedBy -> (string)
                 Service  principal name of the service that created the rule.

                 NOTE:
                     The field is populated only if the service linked rule is
                     created  by  a  service. The field is empty if you create
                     your own rule.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The string that you use in a subsequent request to get the next page
          of results in a paginated response.
