          Enables automatic upgrades to new minor versions for brokers, as new

              Required. The unique ID that Amazon MQ generates for the config-
              uration.

          Revision -> (integer)
              The revision number of the configuration.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Id=string,Revision=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Id": "string",
            "Revision": integer
          }

       --engine-version (string)
          The  broker engine version. For a list of supported engine versions,
          see Supported engines .

       --host-instance-type (string)
          The broker's host instance type to upgrade to. For a  list  of  sup-
          ported instance types, see Broker instance types .

       --ldap-server-metadata (structure)
          Optional.  The  metadata of the LDAP server used to authenticate and
          authorize connections to the broker. Does not apply to RabbitMQ bro-
          kers.

          Hosts -> (list)
              Specifies  the location of the LDAP server such as AWS Directory
              Service for  Microsoft  Active  Directory  .  Optional  failover
              server.

              (string)

          RoleBase -> (string)
              The  distinguished name of the node in the directory information
              tree (DIT) to search for roles or groups. For example, ou=group,
              ou=corp, dc=corp, dc=example, dc=com.

          RoleName -> (string)
              Specifies  the  LDAP  attribute  that  identifies the group name
              attribute in the  object  returned  from  the  group  membership
              query.

          RoleSearchMatching -> (string)
              The  LDAP  search filter used to find roles within the roleBase.
              The distinguished name of the user matched by userSearchMatching
              is  substituted  into  the {0} placeholder in the search filter.
              The client's username is substituted into the  {1}  placeholder.
              For  example,  if you set this option to (member=uid={1})for the
              user janedoe, the  search  filter  becomes  (member=uid=janedoe)
              after string substitution. It matches all role entries that have
              a member  attribute  equal  to  uid=janedoe  under  the  subtree
              selected by the roleBase.

          RoleSearchSubtree -> (boolean)
              The  directory  search scope for the role. If set to true, scope
              is to search the entire subtree.

          ServiceAccountPassword -> (string)
              Service account password. A service account  is  an  account  in
              your  LDAP  server that has access to initiate a connection. For
              example, cn=admin,dc=corp, dc=example, dc=com.

          ServiceAccountUsername -> (string)
              Service account username. A service account  is  an  account  in
              your  LDAP  server that has access to initiate a connection. For
              example, cn=admin,dc=corp, dc=example, dc=com.

          UserBase -> (string)
              Select a particular subtree of the  directory  information  tree
              (DIT)  to search for user entries. The subtree is specified by a
              DN, which specifies the base node of the subtree.  For  example,
              by setting this option to ou=Users,ou=corp, dc=corp, dc=example,
              dc=com, the search for user entries is restricted to the subtree
              beneath ou=Users, ou=corp, dc=corp, dc=example, dc=com.

          UserRoleName -> (string)
              Specifies the name of the LDAP attribute for the user group mem-
              bership.

          UserSearchMatching -> (string)
              The LDAP search filter used to find users within  the  userBase.
              The client's username is substituted into the {0} placeholder in
              the search filter.  For  example,  if  this  option  is  set  to
              (uid={0})  and the received username is janedoe, the search fil-
              ter becomes (uid=janedoe) after  string  substitution.  It  will
              result  in matching an entry like uid=janedoe, ou=Users,ou=corp,
              dc=corp, dc=example, dc=com.

          UserSearchSubtree -> (boolean)
              The directory search scope for the user. If set to  true,  scope
              is to search the entire subtree.

              RabbitMQ brokers.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "DayOfWeek": "MONDAY"|"TUESDAY"|"WEDNESDAY"|"THURSDAY"|"FRIDAY"|"SATURDAY"|"SUNDAY",
            "TimeOfDay": "string",
            "TimeZone": "string"
          }

       --security-groups (list)
          The list of security groups (1 minimum, 5 maximum)  that  authorizes
          connections to brokers.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
