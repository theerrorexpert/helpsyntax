NAME
       create-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  DAX  cluster.  All  nodes  in  the cluster run the same DAX
       caching software.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The cluster identifier. This parameter  is  stored  as  a  lowercase
          string.
              Constraints:

          o A  name  must  contain  from  1  to  20 alphanumeric characters or
            hyphens.

          o The first character must be a letter.

          o A name cannot  end  with  a  hyphen  or  contain  two  consecutive
            hyphens.

       --node-type (string)
          The compute and memory capacity of the nodes in the cluster.

       --description (string)
          A description of the cluster.

       --replication-factor (integer)
          The  number  of  nodes in the DAX cluster. A replication factor of 1
          will create a single-node cluster, without any  read  replicas.  For
          additional  fault  tolerance, you can create a multiple node cluster
          with one or more read replicas. To do this, set ReplicationFactor to
          a  number  between 3 (one primary and two read replicas) and 10 (one
          primary and nine read replicas). If the AvailabilityZones  parameter
          is provided, its length must equal the ReplicationFactor .

          NOTE:
              AWS  recommends  that  you  have  at least two read replicas per
              cluster.

       --availability-zones (list)
          The Availability Zones (AZs) in which the cluster nodes will  reside
          after  the  cluster  has  been  created or updated. If provided, the
          length of this list must equal the ReplicationFactor  parameter.  If
          you omit this parameter, DAX will spread the nodes across Availabil-
          ity Zones for the highest availability.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --subnet-group-name (string)
          The name of the subnet group to be used for the replication group.

          WARNING:
              DAX clusters can only run in an Amazon VPC environment.  All  of
              the subnets that you specify in a subnet group must exist in the
              same VPC.

       --security-group-ids (list)
          A list of security group IDs to be assigned to each node in the  DAX
          cluster. (Each of the security group ID is system-generated.)

          If  this  parameter  is  not  specified, DAX assigns the default VPC
          security group to each node.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --preferred-maintenance-window (string)
          Specifies the weekly time range during which maintenance on the  DAX
          cluster  is  performed.  It  is  specified  as a range in the format
          ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi (24H Clock  UTC).  The  minimum  maintenance
          window is a 60 minute period. Valid values for ddd are:

          o sun

          o mon

          o tue

          o wed

          o thu

          o fri

          o sat

          Example: sun:05:00-sun:09:00

          NOTE:
              If  you  don't  specify  a preferred maintenance window when you
              create or modify a cache cluster, DAX assigns a 60-minute  main-
              tenance window on a randomly selected day of the week.

       --notification-topic-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of the Amazon SNS topic to which
          notifications will be sent.

          NOTE:
              The Amazon SNS topic owner must  be  same  as  the  DAX  cluster
              owner.

       --iam-role-arn (string)
          A  valid  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies an IAM role. At
          runtime, DAX will assume this role and use the role's permissions to
          access DynamoDB on your behalf.

       --parameter-group-name (string)
          The parameter group to be associated with the DAX cluster.

       --tags (list)
          A set of tags to associate with the DAX cluster.

          (structure)
              A  description  of a tag. Every tag is a key-value pair. You can
              add up to 50 tags to a single DAX cluster.

              AWS-assigned tag names and values are automatically assigned the
              aws:  prefix,  which  the  user  cannot assign. AWS-assigned tag
              names do not count towards the tag limit  of  50.  User-assigned
              tag names have the prefix user: .

              You cannot backdate the application of a tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 The  key  for the tag. Tag keys are case sensitive. Every DAX
                 cluster can only have one tag with the same key. If  you  try
                 to  add  an  existing  tag (same key), the existing tag value
                 will be updated to the new value.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag. Tag values are case-sensitive  and  can
                 be null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --sse-specification (structure)
          Represents the settings used to enable server-side encryption on the
          cluster.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether server-side encryption is  enabled  (true)  or
              disabled (false) on the cluster.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Enabled=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Enabled": true|false
          }

       --cluster-endpoint-encryption-type (string)
          The type of encryption the cluster's endpoint should support. Values
          are:

          o NONE for no encryption

          o TLS for Transport Layer Security

          Possible values:

          o NONE

          o TLS

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

              automatically within the maintenance window.

          NotificationConfiguration -> (structure)
              Describes a notification topic and its status. Notification top-

              A  valid Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies an IAM role.
              At runtime, DAX will assume this role and use the role's permis-
              sions to access DynamoDB on your behalf.
