NAME
       update-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  the  settings  for  a DAX cluster. You can use this action to
       change one or more cluster configuration parameters by  specifying  the
       parameters and the new values.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-cluster
          --cluster-name <value>
          [--description <value>]
          [--preferred-maintenance-window <value>]
          [--notification-topic-arn <value>]
          [--notification-topic-status <value>]
          [--parameter-group-name <value>]
          [--security-group-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The name of the DAX cluster to be modified.

       --description (string)
          A description of the changes being made to the cluster.

       --preferred-maintenance-window (string)
          A  range  of  time  when maintenance of DAX cluster software will be
          performed. For example: sun:01:00-sun:09:00  .  Cluster  maintenance
          normally  takes less than 30 minutes, and is performed automatically
          within the maintenance window.

       --notification-topic-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the topic.

       --notification-topic-status (string)
          The current state of the topic. A value of active means that notifi-
          cations  will  be  sent to the topic. A value of inactive means that
          notifications will not be sent to the topic.

       --parameter-group-name (string)
          The name of a parameter group for this cluster.

       --security-group-ids (list)
          A list of user-specified security group IDs to be assigned  to  each
          node  in  the  DAX  cluster. If this parameter is not specified, DAX
          assigns the default VPC security group to each node.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
