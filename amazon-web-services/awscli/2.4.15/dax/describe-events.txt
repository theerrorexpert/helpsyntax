DESCRIBE-EVENTS()                                            DESCRIBE-EVENTS()



NAME
       describe-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  events  related  to DAX clusters and parameter groups. You can
       obtain events specific to a particular DAX cluster or  parameter  group
       by providing the name as a parameter.

       By  default,  only  the  events  occurring within the last 24 hours are
       returned; however, you can retrieve up to 14 days' worth of  events  if
       necessary.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-events  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Events

SYNOPSIS
            describe-events
          [--source-name <value>]
          [--source-type <value>]
          [--start-time <value>]
          [--end-time <value>]
          [--duration <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-name (string)
          The identifier  of  the  event  source  for  which  events  will  be
          returned.  If  not  specified,  then all sources are included in the
          response.

       --source-type (string)
          The event source to retrieve events for. If no value  is  specified,
          all events are returned.

          Possible values:

          o CLUSTER

          o PARAMETER_GROUP

          o SUBNET_GROUP

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The beginning of the time interval to retrieve events for, specified
          in ISO 8601 format.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end of the time interval for which to retrieve events, specified
          in ISO 8601 format.

       --duration (integer)
          The number of minutes' worth of events to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          Provides an identifier to allow retrieval of paginated results.

       Events -> (list)
          An array of events. Each element in the array represents one  event.

          (structure)
              Represents  a  single occurrence of something interesting within
              the system. Some examples of events are creating a DAX  cluster,
              adding or removing a node, or rebooting a node.

              SourceName -> (string)
                 The  source  of the event. For example, if the event occurred
                 at the node level, the source would be the node ID.

              SourceType -> (string)
                 Specifies the origin of this event - a cluster,  a  parameter
                 group, a node ID, etc.

              Message -> (string)
                 A user-defined message associated with the event.

              Date -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the event occurred.
