NAME
       logs -

DESCRIPTION
       You  can  use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access your
       log files from EC2 instances, CloudTrail, and other  sources.  You  can
       then  retrieve  the  associated log data from CloudWatch Logs using the
       CloudWatch console, CloudWatch Logs commands in the Amazon Web Services
       CLI, CloudWatch Logs API, or CloudWatch Logs SDK.

       You can use CloudWatch Logs to:

       o Monitor logs from EC2 instances in real-time : You can use CloudWatch
         Logs to monitor applications and systems using log data. For example,
         CloudWatch  Logs  can  track  the number of errors that occur in your
         application logs and send you a notification  whenever  the  rate  of
         errors  exceeds  a  threshold  that you specify. CloudWatch Logs uses
         your log data for monitoring so no code  changes  are  required.  For
         example,  you can monitor application logs for specific literal terms
         (such as "NullReferenceException") or count the number of occurrences
         of a literal term at a particular position in log data (such as "404"
         status codes in an Apache access log). When the term you are  search-
         ing  for  is  found, CloudWatch Logs reports the data to a CloudWatch
         metric that you specify.

       o Monitor CloudTrail logged events : You can create  alarms  in  Cloud-
         Watch  and  receive  notifications of particular API activity as cap-
         tured by CloudTrail. You can use the notification  to  perform  trou-
         bleshooting.

       o Archive log data : You can use CloudWatch Logs to store your log data
         in highly durable storage. You can change the log  retention  setting
         so  that  any  log  events  older than this setting are automatically
         deleted. The CloudWatch Logs agent makes it easy to quickly send both
         rotated  and non-rotated log data off of a host and into the log ser-
         vice. You can then access the raw log data when you need it.
