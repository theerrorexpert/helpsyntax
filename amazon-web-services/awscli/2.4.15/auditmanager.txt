DESCRIPTION
       Welcome  to the Audit Manager API reference. This guide is for develop-
       ers who need detailed information about the Audit  Manager  API  opera-
       tions, data types, and errors.

       Audit  Manager is a service that provides automated evidence collection
       so that you can continually audit your Amazon Web Services  usage.  You
       can  use  it to assess the effectiveness of your controls, manage risk,
       and simplify compliance.

       Audit Manager provides prebuilt frameworks that structure and  automate
       assessments  for a given compliance standard. Frameworks include a pre-
       built collection of controls with descriptions and testing  procedures.
       These  controls are grouped according to the requirements of the speci-
       fied compliance standard or regulation. You can also  customize  frame-
       works  and  controls  to support internal audits with specific require-
       ments.
