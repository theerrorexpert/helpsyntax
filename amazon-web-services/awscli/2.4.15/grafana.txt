DESCRIPTION
       Amazon Managed Grafana is a fully managed and secure data visualization
       service that you can use to instantly query, correlate,  and  visualize
       operational  metrics,  logs,  and  traces from multiple sources. Amazon
       Managed Grafana makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale Grafana,  a
       widely  deployed data visualization tool that is popular for its exten-
       sible data support.

       With Amazon Managed Grafana,  you  create  logically  isolated  Grafana
       servers  called  workspaces  .  In  a workspace, you can create Grafana
       dashboards and visualizations to analyze your metrics, logs, and traces
       without having to build, package, or deploy any hardware to run Grafana
       servers.
