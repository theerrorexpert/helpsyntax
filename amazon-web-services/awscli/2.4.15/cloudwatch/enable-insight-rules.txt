DESCRIPTION
       Enables  the  specified  Contributor  Insights  rules.  When  rules are
       enabled, they immediately begin analyzing log data.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            enable-insight-rules
          --rule-names <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rule-names (list)
          An array of the rule names to enable. If you need to  find  out  the
          names of your rules, use DescribeInsightRules .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Failures -> (list)
          An  array  listing  the  rules that could not be enabled. You cannot
          disable or enable built-in rules.

          (structure)
              This array is empty if the API operation was successful for  all
              the  rules  specified in the request. If the operation could not
              process one of the rules, the following  data  is  returned  for
              each of those rules.

              FailureResource -> (string)
                 The specified rule that could not be deleted.

              ExceptionType -> (string)
                 The type of error.

              FailureCode -> (string)
                 The code of the error.

              FailureDescription -> (string)
                 A description of the error.
