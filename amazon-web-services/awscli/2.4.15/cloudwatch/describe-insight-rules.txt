DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of all the Contributor Insights rules in your account.

       For  more information about Contributor Insights, see Using Contributor
       Insights to Analyze High-Cardinality Data .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-insight-rules
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          Include this value, if it was returned by the previous operation, to
          get the next set of rules.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  results to return in one operation. If you
          omit this parameter, the default of 500 is used.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If this parameter is present, it is a token that marks the start  of
          the next batch of returned results.

       InsightRules -> (list)
          The rules returned by the operation.

          (structure)
              This   structure  contains  the  definition  for  a  Contributor
              Insights rule. For more information about this  rule,  see`Using
              Constributor   Insights  to  analyze  high-cardinality  data  <-
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitor-
              ing/ContributorInsights.html>`__  in  the Amazon CloudWatch User
              Guide .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the rule.

              State -> (string)
                 Indicates whether the rule is enabled or disabled.

              Schema -> (string)
                 For rules that you create, this is  always  {"Name":  "Cloud-
                 WatchLogRule",  "Version":  1}  .  For managed rules, this is
                 {"Name": "ServiceLogRule", "Version": 1}

              Definition -> (string)
                 The definition of the rule, as a JSON object. The  definition
                 contains  the keywords used to define contributors, the value
                 to aggregate on if this rule  returns  a  sum  instead  of  a
                 count,  and the filters. For details on the valid syntax, see
                 Contributor Insights Rule Syntax .
