LIST-DASHBOARDS()                                            LIST-DASHBOARDS()



NAME
       list-dashboards -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of the dashboards for your account. If you include Dash-
       boardNamePrefix , only those dashboards with names  starting  with  the
       prefix  are  listed.  Otherwise,  all  dashboards  in  your account are
       listed.
          ListDashboards returns up to 1000 results on one page. If there  are
          more  than  1000  dashboards,  you can call ListDashboards again and
          include the value you received for NextToken in the first  call,  to
          receive the next 1000 results.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-dashboards  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: DashboardEntries

SYNOPSIS
            list-dashboards
          [--dashboard-name-prefix <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dashboard-name-prefix (string)
          If you specify this parameter, only the dashboards with names start-
          ing with the specified string are listed. The maximum length is 255,
          and valid characters are A-Z, a-z, 0-9, ".", "-", and "_".

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DashboardEntries -> (list)
          The list of matching dashboards.

          (structure)
              Represents a specific dashboard.

              DashboardName -> (string)
                 The name of the dashboard.

              DashboardArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dashboard.

              LastModified -> (timestamp)
                 The time stamp of  when  the  dashboard  was  last  modified,
                 either  by an API call or through the console. This number is
                 expressed as the number of milliseconds  since  Jan  1,  1970
                 00:00:00 UTC.

              Size -> (long)
                 The size of the dashboard, in bytes.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token  that  marks  the  start  of  the  next batch of returned
