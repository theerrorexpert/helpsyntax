NAME
       describe-anomaly-detectors -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  anomaly  detection  models  that  you  have created in your
       account. For single metric anomaly detectors, you can list all  of  the
       models  in  your  account or filter the results to only the models that
       are related to a certain namespace, metric name, or  metric  dimension.
       For  metric  math  anomaly  detectors, you can list them by adding MET-
       RIC_MATH to the AnomalyDetectorTypes array. This will return all metric
       math anomaly detectors in your account.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-anomaly-detectors
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--namespace <value>]
          [--metric-name <value>]
          [--dimensions <value>]
          [--anomaly-detector-types <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          Use the token returned by the previous operation to request the next
          page of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return in one operation. The  maxi-
          mum value that you can specify is 100.

          To  retrieve  the  remaining  results,  make  another  call with the
          returned NextToken value.

       --namespace (string)
          Limits the results to only the anomaly  detection  models  that  are
          associated with the specified namespace.

       --metric-name (string)
          Limits  the  results  to  only the anomaly detection models that are
          associated with the specified metric name.  If  there  are  multiple
          metrics  with  this  name  in different namespaces that have anomaly
          detection models, they're all returned.

       --dimensions (list)
          Limits the results to only the anomaly  detection  models  that  are
          associated with the specified metric dimensions. If there are multi-
          ple metrics that have these dimensions and  have  anomaly  detection
          models associated, they're all returned.

          (structure)
              A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of
              a metric. You can assign  up  to  10  dimensions  to  a  metric.
              Because  dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a met-
              ric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to  one  of  your
              metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name of the dimension. Dimension names must contain only
                 ASCII characters and must include at least one non-whitespace
                 character.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value  of  the  dimension. Dimension values must contain
                 only  ASCII  characters  and  must  include  at   least   one
                 non-whitespace character.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --anomaly-detector-types (list)
          The  anomaly detector types to request when using DescribeAnomalyDe-
          tectorsInput . If empty, defaults to SINGLE_METRIC .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            SINGLE_METRIC
            METRIC_MATH

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AnomalyDetectors -> (list)
          The list of anomaly detection models returned by the operation.

          (structure)
              An anomaly detection model associated with a  particular  Cloud-
              Watch  metric, statistic, or metric math expression. You can use
              the model to display a band of expected, normal values when  the
              metric is graphed.

              Namespace -> (string)
                 The  namespace  of  the  metric  associated  with the anomaly
                 detection model.

              MetricName -> (string)
                 The name of the metric associated with the anomaly  detection
                 model.

              Dimensions -> (list)
                 The  metric  dimensions associated with the anomaly detection
                 model.

                 (structure)
                     A dimension is a name/value pair  that  is  part  of  the
                     identity  of a metric. You can assign up to 10 dimensions
                     to a metric. Because dimensions are part  of  the  unique
                     identifier  for  a  metric,  whenever  you  add  a unique
                     name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are  creating
                     a new variation of that metric.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The  name  of the dimension. Dimension names must con-
                        tain only ASCII characters and must include  at  least
                        one non-whitespace character.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the dimension. Dimension values must con-
                        tain only ASCII characters and must include  at  least
                        one non-whitespace character.

              Stat -> (string)
                 The statistic associated with the anomaly detection model.

              Configuration -> (structure)
                 The  configuration  specifies  details  about how the anomaly
                 detection model is to be trained, including  time  ranges  to
                 exclude from use for training the model, and the time zone to
                 use for the metric.

                 ExcludedTimeRanges -> (list)
                     An array of time ranges to  exclude  from  use  when  the
                     anomaly detection model is trained. Use this to make sure
                     that events that could cause unusual values for the  met-
                     ric,  such  as  deployments,  aren't used when CloudWatch
                     creates the model.

                     (structure)
                        Specifies one range of days or times to  exclude  from
                        use for training an anomaly detection model.

                        StartTime -> (timestamp)
                            The start time of the range to exclude. The format
                            is   yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss    .    For    example,
                            2019-07-01T23:59:59 .

                        EndTime -> (timestamp)
                            The  end  time of the range to exclude. The format
                            is   yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss    .    For    example,
                            2019-07-01T23:59:59 .

                 MetricTimezone -> (string)
                     The  time  zone  to use for the metric. This is useful to
                     enable the model to automatically  account  for  daylight
                     savings  time  changes if the metric is sensitive to such
                     time changes.

                     To specify a time zone, use the name of the time zone  as
                     specified  in the standard tz database. For more informa-
                     tion, see tz database .

              StateValue -> (string)
                 The current status of the anomaly  detector's  training.  The
                 possible    values   are   TRAINED   |   PENDING_TRAINING   |
                 TRAINED_INSUFFICIENT_DATA

              SingleMetricAnomalyDetector -> (structure)
                 The CloudWatch metric and statistic for this  anomaly  detec-
                 tor.

                 Namespace -> (string)
                     The  namespace of the metric to create the anomaly detec-
                     tion model for.

                 MetricName -> (string)
                     The name of the metric to create  the  anomaly  detection
                     model for.

                 Dimensions -> (list)
                     The  metric  dimensions  to  create the anomaly detection
                     model for.

                     (structure)
                        A dimension is a name/value pair that is part  of  the
                        identity  of  a metric. You can assign up to 10 dimen-
                        sions to a metric. Because dimensions are part of  the
                        unique  identifier  for  a  metric, whenever you add a
                        unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are
                        creating a new variation of that metric.

                        Name -> (string)
                            The  name  of  the dimension. Dimension names must
                            contain only ASCII characters and must include  at
                            least one non-whitespace character.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  value of the dimension. Dimension values must
                            contain only ASCII characters and must include  at
                            least one non-whitespace character.

                 Stat -> (string)
                     The statistic to use for the metric and anomaly detection
                     model.

              MetricMathAnomalyDetector -> (structure)
                 The CloudWatch metric math expression for this anomaly detec-
                 tor.

                 MetricDataQueries -> (list)
                     An array of metric data query structures that enables you
                     to create an anomaly detector based on the  result  of  a
                     metric  math  expression.  Each item in MetricDataQueries
                     gets a metric or performs a math expression. One item  in
                     MetricDataQueries  is  the  expression  that provides the
                     time series that the anomaly detector uses as input. Des-
                     ignate  the  expression by setting ReturnData to True for
                     this object in the array. For all other  expressions  and
                     metrics, set ReturnData to False . The designated expres-
                     sion must return a single time series.

                     (structure)
                        This structure is used in both GetMetricData and  Put-
                        MetricAlarm  .  The supported use of this structure is
                        different for those two operations.

                        When used in GetMetricData , it indicates  the  metric
                        data to return, and whether this call is just retriev-
                        ing a batch set of data for one metric, or is perform-
                        ing a math expression on metric data. A single GetMet-
                        ricData call can include  up  to  500  MetricDataQuery
                        structures.

                        When used in PutMetricAlarm , it enables you to create
                        an alarm based on a metric math expression. Each  Met-
                        ricDataQuery in the array specifies either a metric to
                        retrieve, or a math  expression  to  be  performed  on
                        retrieved  metrics.  A  single PutMetricAlarm call can
                        include up to 20  MetricDataQuery  structures  in  the
                        array.  The  20  structures  can include as many as 10
                        structures that  contain  a  MetricStat  parameter  to
                        retrieve  a  metric, and as many as 10 structures that
                        contain the Expression parameter  to  perform  a  math
                        expression.  Of  those Expression structures, one must
                        have True as the value for ReturnData . The result  of
                        this expression is the value the alarm watches.

                        Any expression used in a PutMetricAlarm operation must
                        return a single time series. For more information, see
                        Metric  Math Syntax and Functions in the Amazon Cloud-
                        Watch User Guide .

                        Some of the parameters of  this  structure  also  have
                        different uses whether you are using this structure in
                        a GetMetricData operation or a  PutMetricAlarm  opera-
                        tion. These differences are explained in the following
                        parameter list.

                        Id -> (string)
                            A short name  used  to  tie  this  object  to  the
                            results  in the response. This name must be unique
                            within a single call to GetMetricData . If you are
                            performing  math  expressions on this set of data,
                            this name represents that data and can serve as  a
                            variable in the mathematical expression. The valid
                            characters are letters, numbers,  and  underscore.
                            The first character must be a lowercase letter.

                        MetricStat -> (structure)
                            The  metric to be returned, along with statistics,
                            period, and units. Use this parameter only if this
                            object is retrieving a metric and not performing a
                            math expression on returned data.

                            Within one MetricDataQuery object, you must  spec-
                            ify  either Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                            Metric -> (structure)
                               The metric  to  return,  including  the  metric
                               name, namespace, and dimensions.

                               Namespace -> (string)
                                   The namespace of the metric.

                               MetricName -> (string)
                                   The  name of the metric. This is a required
                                   field.

                               Dimensions -> (list)
                                   The dimensions for the metric.

                                   (structure)
                                      A dimension is a name/value pair that is
                                      part  of  the  identity of a metric. You
                                      can assign up to 10 dimensions to a met-
                                      ric.  Because dimensions are part of the
                                      unique identifier for a metric, whenever
                                      you  add a unique name/value pair to one
                                      of your metrics, you are creating a  new
                                      variation of that metric.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the dimension. Dimension
                                          names must contain only ASCII  char-
                                          acters and must include at least one
                                          non-whitespace character.

                                      Value -> (string)
                                          The value of the  dimension.  Dimen-
                                          sion  values must contain only ASCII
                                          characters and must include at least
                                          one non-whitespace character.

                            Period -> (integer)
                               The  granularity,  in  seconds, of the returned
                               data points. For metrics with  regular  resolu-
                               tion,  a  period  can be as short as one minute
                               (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60.  For
                               high-resolution  metrics  that are collected at
                               intervals of less than one minute,  the  period
                               can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60.
                               High-resolution  metrics  are   those   metrics
                               stored  by a PutMetricData call that includes a
                               StorageResolution of 1 second.

                               If the StartTime  parameter  specifies  a  time
                               stamp  that  is  greater  than 3 hours ago, you
                               must specify the period as follows or  no  data
                               points in that time range is returned:

                               o Start  time between 3 hours and 15 days ago -
                                 Use a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute).

                               o Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a
                                 multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes).

                               o Start  time  greater than 63 days ago - Use a
                                 multiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour).

                            Stat -> (string)
                               The statistic to return.  It  can  include  any
                               CloudWatch statistic or extended statistic.

                            Unit -> (string)
                               When  you  are  using  a  Put  operation,  this
                               defines what unit you want to use when  storing
                               the metric.

                               In  a  Get operation, if you omit Unit then all
                               data  that  was  collected  with  any  unit  is
                               returned,  along  with  the corresponding units
                               that were specified when the data was  reported
                               to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the oper-
                               ation returns only data that was collected with
                               that unit specified. If you specify a unit that
                               does not match the data collected, the  results
                               of  the operation are null. CloudWatch does not
                               perform unit conversions.

                        Expression -> (string)
                            The  math  expression  to  be  performed  on   the
                            returned data, if this object is performing a math
                            expression. This expression can use the Id of  the
                            other  metrics  to refer to those metrics, and can
                            also use the Id of other expressions  to  use  the
                            result  of those expressions. For more information
                            about metric math  expressions,  see  Metric  Math
                            Syntax and Functions in the Amazon CloudWatch User
                            Guide .

                            Within each MetricDataQuery object, you must spec-
                            ify  either Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                        Label -> (string)
                            A human-readable label for this metric or  expres-
                            sion.  This  is  especially  useful  if this is an
                            expression, so that you know what the value repre-
                            sents.  If  the metric or expression is shown in a
                            CloudWatch dashboard widget, the label  is  shown.
                            If   Label  is  omitted,  CloudWatch  generates  a
                            default.

                            You can put dynamic expressions into a  label,  so
                            that it is more descriptive. For more information,
                            see Using Dynamic Labels .

                        ReturnData -> (boolean)
                            When used in GetMetricData , this option indicates
                            whether to return the timestamps and raw data val-
                            ues of this metric. If  you  are  performing  this
                            call  just  to do math expressions and do not also
                            need the raw data returned, you can specify  False
                            . If you omit this, the default of True is used.

                            When used in PutMetricAlarm , specify True for the
                            one expression result to use as the alarm. For all
                            other  metrics and expressions in the same PutMet-
                            ricAlarm operation, specify ReturnData as False.

                        Period -> (integer)
                            The granularity, in seconds, of the returned  data
                            points.  For  metrics  with  regular resolution, a
                            period can be as short as one minute (60  seconds)
                            and  must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution
                            metrics that are collected at  intervals  of  less
                            than  one  minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30,
                            60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics
                            are those metrics stored by a PutMetricData opera-
                            tion that includes a StorageResolution of 1 second
                            .

                        AccountId -> (string)
                            The  ID  of  the  account  where  the  metrics are
                            located, if this is a cross-account alarm.

                            Use this field only for PutMetricAlarm operations.
                            It is not used in GetMetricData operations.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that you can use in a subsequent operation to retrieve the
          next set of results.
