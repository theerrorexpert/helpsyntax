DESCRIBE-ALARMS()                                            DESCRIBE-ALARMS()



NAME
       describe-alarms -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the specified alarms. You can filter the results by specify-
       ing a prefix for the alarm name, the alarm state, or a prefix  for  any
       action.

       To  use  this  operation and return information about composite alarms,
       you must be signed on  with  the  cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms  permission
       that  is  scoped  to  *  . You can't return information about composite
       alarms if your  cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms  permission  has  a  narrower
       scope.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-alarms  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: MetricAlarms, CompositeAlarms

SYNOPSIS
            describe-alarms
          [--alarm-names <value>]
          [--alarm-name-prefix <value>]
          [--alarm-types <value>]
          [--children-of-alarm-name <value>]
          [--parents-of-alarm-name <value>]
          [--state-value <value>]
          [--action-prefix <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --alarm-names (list)
          The names of the alarms to retrieve information about.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --alarm-name-prefix (string)
          An alarm name prefix. If you specify  this  parameter,  you  receive
          information  about  all  alarms that have names that start with this
          prefix.

          If this parameter is specified, you cannot specify AlarmNames .

       --alarm-types (list)
          Use this parameter to specify whether  you  want  the  operation  to
          return  metric  alarms or composite alarms. If you omit this parame-
          ter, only metric alarms are returned.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            CompositeAlarm
            MetricAlarm

       --children-of-alarm-name (string)
          If you use this parameter and specify the name of a composite alarm,
          the operation returns information about the "children" alarms of the
          alarm you specify. These are the metric alarms and composite  alarms
          referenced  in  the  AlarmRule field of the composite alarm that you
          specify in ChildrenOfAlarmName .  Information  about  the  composite
          alarm that you name in ChildrenOfAlarmName is not returned.

          If  you  specify  ChildrenOfAlarmName , you cannot specify any other
          parameters in the request except for MaxRecords and NextToken  .  If
          you do so, you receive a validation error.

          NOTE:
              Only  the  Alarm  Name  ,  ARN  ,  StateValue (OK/ALARM/INSUFFI-
              CIENT_DATA), and StateUpdatedTimestamp information are  returned
              by  this  operation when you use this parameter. To get complete
              information about these alarms, perform  another  DescribeAlarms
              operation  and  specify the parent alarm names in the AlarmNames
              parameter.

       --parents-of-alarm-name (string)
          If you use this parameter and specify the name of a metric  or  com-
          posite  alarm,  the operation returns information about the "parent"
          alarms of the alarm you specify. These are the composite alarms that
          have  AlarmRule  parameters  that  reference the alarm named in Par-
          entsOfAlarmName . Information about the alarm that  you  specify  in
          ParentsOfAlarmName is not returned.

          If  you  specify  ParentsOfAlarmName  , you cannot specify any other
          parameters in the request except for MaxRecords and NextToken  .  If
          you do so, you receive a validation error.

          NOTE:
              Only  the Alarm Name and ARN are returned by this operation when
              you use this parameter. To get complete information about  these
              alarms, perform another DescribeAlarms operation and specify the
              parent alarm names in the AlarmNames parameter.

       --state-value (string)
          Specify this parameter to receive information only about alarms that
          are currently in the state that you specify.

          Possible values:

          o OK

          o ALARM

          o INSUFFICIENT_DATA

       --action-prefix (string)
          Use  this  parameter  to filter the results of the operation to only
          those alarms that use a certain alarm action. For example, you could
          specify the ARN of an SNS topic to find all alarms that send notifi-
          cations to that topic.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              Namespace -> (string)
                 The namespace of the metric associated with the alarm.

              Statistic -> (string)
                 The statistic for the metric associated with the alarm, other
                 than  percentile.  For  percentile  statistics, use Extended-

              ExtendedStatistic -> (string)
                 The percentile statistic for the metric associated  with  the
                 alarm. Specify a value between p0.0 and p100.

              Dimensions -> (list)
                 The dimensions for the metric associated with the alarm.

                 (structure)
                     A  dimension  is  a  name/value  pair that is part of the
                     identity of a metric. You can assign up to 10  dimensions
                     to  a  metric.  Because dimensions are part of the unique
                     identifier for  a  metric,  whenever  you  add  a  unique
                     name/value  pair to one of your metrics, you are creating
                     a new variation of that metric.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the dimension. Dimension names  must  con-
                        tain  only  ASCII characters and must include at least
                        one non-whitespace character.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the dimension. Dimension values must con-
                        tain  only  ASCII characters and must include at least
                        one non-whitespace character.

              Period -> (integer)
                 The period, in seconds, over which the statistic is  applied.

              Unit -> (string)
                 The unit of the metric associated with the alarm.

              EvaluationPeriods -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  periods  over  which data is compared to the
                 specified threshold.

              DatapointsToAlarm -> (integer)
                 The number of data points that must be breaching  to  trigger
                 the alarm.

              Threshold -> (double)
                 The value to compare with the specified statistic.

              ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                 The  arithmetic operation to use when comparing the specified
                 statistic and threshold. The  specified  statistic  value  is
                 used as the first operand.

              TreatMissingData -> (string)
                 Sets how this alarm is to handle missing data points. If this
                 parameter is omitted, the  default  behavior  of  missing  is
                 used.

              EvaluateLowSampleCountPercentile -> (string)
                 Used  only  for  alarms based on percentiles. If ignore , the
                 alarm state does not change during periods with too few  data
                 points  to  be statistically significant. If evaluate or this
                 parameter is not used, the alarm is always evaluated and pos-
                 sibly changes state no matter how many data points are avail-
                 able.

              Metrics -> (list)
                 An array of MetricDataQuery  structures,  used  in  an  alarm
                 based  on  a  metric  math  expression. Each structure either
                 retrieves a metric or performs a math expression. One item in
                 the  Metrics  array  is  the  math  expression that the alarm
                 watches. This expression by designated by  having  ReturnData
                 set to true.

                 (structure)
                     This  structure is used in both GetMetricData and PutMet-
                     ricAlarm . The supported use of this structure is differ-
                     ent for those two operations.

                     When used in GetMetricData , it indicates the metric data
                     to return, and whether this call  is  just  retrieving  a
                     batch set of data for one metric, or is performing a math
                     expression on metric data. A  single  GetMetricData  call
                     can include up to 500 MetricDataQuery structures.

                     When used in PutMetricAlarm , it enables you to create an
                     alarm based on a metric math expression. Each MetricData-
                     Query in the array specifies either a metric to retrieve,
                     or a math expression to be performed  on  retrieved  met-
                     rics.  A  single PutMetricAlarm call can include up to 20
                     MetricDataQuery structures in the array.  The  20  struc-
                     tures can include as many as 10 structures that contain a
                     MetricStat parameter to retrieve a metric, and as many as
                     10  structures  that  contain the Expression parameter to
                     perform a math expression.  Of  those  Expression  struc-
                     tures,  one  must have True as the value for ReturnData .
                     The result of this expression  is  the  value  the  alarm
                     watches.

                     Any  expression  used  in a PutMetricAlarm operation must
                     return a single time series. For  more  information,  see
                     Metric Math Syntax and Functions in the Amazon CloudWatch
                     User Guide .

                     Some of the parameters of this structure also  have  dif-
                     ferent  uses  whether  you  are using this structure in a
                     GetMetricData operation or  a  PutMetricAlarm  operation.
                     These  differences are explained in the following parame-
                     ter list.

                     Id -> (string)
                        A short name used to tie this object to the results in
                        the response. This name must be unique within a single
                        call to GetMetricData . If  you  are  performing  math
                        expressions  on this set of data, this name represents
                        that data and can serve as a variable in the mathemat-
                        ical  expression.  The  valid  characters are letters,
                        numbers, and underscore. The first character must be a
                        lowercase letter.

                     MetricStat -> (structure)
                        The  metric  to  be  returned,  along with statistics,
                        period, and units. Use this  parameter  only  if  this
                        object  is  retrieving  a  metric and not performing a
                        math expression on returned data.

                        Within one MetricDataQuery object,  you  must  specify
                        either Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                        Metric -> (structure)
                            The  metric  to return, including the metric name,
                            namespace, and dimensions.

                            Namespace -> (string)
                               The namespace of the metric.

                            MetricName -> (string)
                               The name of the  metric.  This  is  a  required
                               field.

                            Dimensions -> (list)
                               The dimensions for the metric.

                               (structure)
                                   A  dimension  is  a name/value pair that is
                                   part of the identity of a metric.  You  can
                                   assign  up  to  10  dimensions to a metric.
                                   Because dimensions are part of  the  unique
                                   identifier for a metric, whenever you add a
                                   unique name/value pair to one of your  met-
                                   rics,  you  are creating a new variation of
                                   that metric.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name  of  the  dimension.  Dimension
                                      names must contain only ASCII characters
                                      and must include at least one non-white-
                                      space character.

                                   Value -> (string)
                                      The  value  of  the dimension. Dimension
                                      values must contain only  ASCII  charac-
                                      ters  and  must  include  at  least  one
                                      non-whitespace character.

                        Period -> (integer)
                            The granularity, in seconds, of the returned  data
                            points.  For  metrics  with  regular resolution, a
                            period can be as short as one minute (60  seconds)
                            and  must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution
                            metrics that are collected at  intervals  of  less
                            than  one  minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30,
                            60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics
                            are  those  metrics stored by a PutMetricData call
                            that includes a StorageResolution of 1 second.

                            If the StartTime parameter specifies a time  stamp
                            that is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify
                            the period as follows or no data  points  in  that
                            time range is returned:

                            o Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use
                              a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute).

                            o Start time between 15 and 63 days ago  -  Use  a
                              multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes).

                            o Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a mul-
                              tiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour).

                        Stat -> (string)
                            The statistic to return. It can include any Cloud-
                            Watch statistic or extended statistic.

                        Unit -> (string)
                            When  you  are using a Put operation, this defines
                            what unit you want to use when storing the metric.

                            In a Get operation, if you omit Unit then all data
                            that was collected  with  any  unit  is  returned,
                            along with the corresponding units that were spec-
                            ified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If
                            you  specify  a  unit,  the operation returns only
                            data that was collected with that unit  specified.
                            If you specify a unit that does not match the data
                            collected, the results of the operation are  null.
                            CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions.

                     Expression -> (string)
                        The  math  expression  to be performed on the returned
                        data, if this object is performing a math  expression.
                        This expression can use the Id of the other metrics to
                        refer to those metrics, and can also  use  the  Id  of
                        other  expressions  to use the result of those expres-
                        sions. For more information about metric math  expres-
                        sions,  see  Metric  Math  Syntax and Functions in the
                        Amazon CloudWatch User Guide .

                        Within each MetricDataQuery object, you  must  specify
                        either Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                     Label -> (string)
                        A  human-readable label for this metric or expression.
                        This is especially useful if this is an expression, so
                        that you know what the value represents. If the metric
                        or expression is shown in a CloudWatch dashboard  wid-
                        get,  the  label is shown. If Label is omitted, Cloud-
                        Watch generates a default.

                        You can put dynamic expressions into a label, so  that
                        it  is  more  descriptive.  For  more information, see
                        Using Dynamic Labels .

                     ReturnData -> (boolean)
                        When used in GetMetricData  ,  this  option  indicates
                        whether  to  return the timestamps and raw data values
                        of this metric. If you are performing this  call  just
                        to  do  math  expressions and do not also need the raw
                        data returned, you can specify False  .  If  you  omit
                        this, the default of True is used.

                        When used in PutMetricAlarm , specify True for the one
                        expression result to use as the alarm. For  all  other
                        metrics  and  expressions  in  the same PutMetricAlarm
                        operation, specify ReturnData as False.

                     Period -> (integer)
                        The granularity, in  seconds,  of  the  returned  data
                        points.  For metrics with regular resolution, a period
                        can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be
                        a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are
                        collected at intervals of less than  one  minute,  the
                        period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60.
                        High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by  a
                        PutMetricData operation that includes a StorageResolu-
                        tion of 1 second .

                     AccountId -> (string)
                        The ID of the account where the metrics  are  located,
                        if this is a cross-account alarm.

                        Use  this field only for PutMetricAlarm operations. It
                        is not used in GetMetricData operations.

              ThresholdMetricId -> (string)
                 In an alarm based on an anomaly detection model, this is  the
                 ID of the ANOMALY_DETECTION_BAND function used as the thresh-
                 old for the alarm.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token that marks  the  start  of  the  next  batch  of  returned
          results.



                                                             DESCRIBE-ALARMS()
