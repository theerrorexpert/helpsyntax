GET-METRIC-WIDGET-IMAGE()                            GET-METRIC-WIDGET-IMAGE()



NAME
       get-metric-widget-image -

DESCRIPTION
       You  can  use the GetMetricWidgetImage API to retrieve a snapshot graph
       of one or more Amazon CloudWatch metrics as a  bitmap  image.  You  can
       then  embed  this  image  into your services and products, such as wiki
       pages, reports, and documents. You could  also  retrieve  images  regu-
       larly, such as every minute, and create your own custom live dashboard.

       The graph you retrieve can include all  CloudWatch  metric  graph  fea-
       tures, including metric math and horizontal and vertical annotations.

       There  is a limit of 20 transactions per second for this API. Each Get-
       MetricWidgetImage action has the following limits:

       o As many as 100 metrics in the graph.

       o Up to 100 KB uncompressed payload.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-metric-widget-image
          --metric-widget <value>
          [--output-format <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --metric-widget (string)
          A JSON string that defines the bitmap graph  to  be  retrieved.  The
          string  includes  the  metrics  to include in the graph, statistics,
          annotations, title, axis limits, and so on. You can include only one
          MetricWidget parameter in each GetMetricWidgetImage call.

          For   more   information   about  the  syntax  of  MetricWidget  see
          GetMetricWidgetImage: Metric Widget Structure and Syntax .

          If any metric on the graph could not load  all  the  requested  data
          points, an orange triangle with an exclamation point appears next to
          the graph legend.

       --output-format (string)
          The format of the resulting image. Only PNG images are supported.

          The default is png . If you specify png , the API  returns  an  HTTP
          response  with  the content-type set to text/xml . The image data is
          in a MetricWidgetImage field. For example:
              <GetMetricWidgetImageResponse xmlns=<URLstring>>

              <GetMetricWidgetImageResult>

              <MetricWidgetImage>

              iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAlgAAAGQEAYAAAAip...

              </MetricWidgetImage>

              </GetMetricWidgetImageResult>

              <ResponseMetadata>

              <RequestId>6f0d4192-4d42-11e8-82c1-f539a07e0e3b</RequestId>

              </ResponseMetadata>

              </GetMetricWidgetImageResponse>

          The image/png setting is intended only for custom HTTP requests. For
          most  use  cases,  and all actions using an Amazon Web Services SDK,
          you should use png . If you specify image/png ,  the  HTTP  response
          has  a  content-type set to image/png , and the body of the response
          is a PNG image.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       MetricWidgetImage -> (blob)
          The image of the graph, in the output format specified.  The  output
          is base64-encoded.
