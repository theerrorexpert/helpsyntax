PUT-DASHBOARD()                                                PUT-DASHBOARD()



NAME
       put-dashboard -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a dashboard if it does not already exist, or updates an exist-
       ing dashboard. If you update  a  dashboard,  the  entire  contents  are
       replaced with what you specify here.

       All dashboards in your account are global, not region-specific.

       A  simple  way  to  create a dashboard using PutDashboard is to copy an
       existing dashboard. To copy an existing dashboard  using  the  console,
       you can load the dashboard and then use the View/edit source command in
       the Actions menu to display the JSON block for that dashboard.  Another
       way  to copy a dashboard is to use GetDashboard , and then use the data
       returned within DashboardBody as the template  for  the  new  dashboard
       when you call PutDashboard .

       When  you  create a dashboard with PutDashboard , a good practice is to
       add a text widget at the top of the dashboard with a message  that  the
       dashboard  was  created by script and should not be changed in the con-
       sole. This message could also point console users to  the  location  of
       the  DashboardBody script or the CloudFormation template used to create
       the dashboard.

SYNOPSIS
            put-dashboard
          --dashboard-name <value>
          --dashboard-body <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dashboard-name (string)
          The name of the dashboard. If a dashboard  with  this  name  already
          exists,  this  call  modifies  that dashboard, replacing its current
          contents. Otherwise, a new dashboard is created. The maximum  length
          is  255,  and valid characters are A-Z, a-z, 0-9, "-", and "_". This
          parameter is required.

       --dashboard-body (string)
          The detailed information about the dashboard in JSON format, includ-
          ing the widgets to include and their location on the dashboard. This
          parameter is required.

          For more information about the syntax, see Dashboard Body  Structure
          and Syntax .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DashboardValidationMessages -> (list)
          If the input for PutDashboard was correct and the dashboard was suc-
          cessfully created or modified, this result is empty.

          If this result includes only warning messages, then  the  input  was
          valid  enough  for the dashboard to be created or modified, but some
          elements of the dashboard might not render.

          If this result includes error messages, the input was not valid  and
          the operation failed.

          (structure)
              An error or warning for the operation.

              DataPath -> (string)
                 The data path related to the message.

              Message -> (string)
                 A message describing the error or warning.
