GET-EXPERIMENT()                                              GET-EXPERIMENT()



NAME
       get-experiment -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  details  about  one experiment. You must already know the
       experiment name. To retrieve a list of experiments in your account, use
       ListExperiments .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-experiment
          --experiment <value>
          --project <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --experiment (string)
          The name of the experiment that you want to see the details of.

       --project (string)
          The name or ARN of the project that contains the experiment.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          metricGoals -> (list)
              An array of structures that defines the  metrics  used  for  the

              is the goal.

              (structure)
                 A structure that tells Evidently whether higher or lower val-
                 ues are desired for a metric that is used in an experiment.

                 desiredChange -> (string)
                     INCREASE  means that a variation with a higher number for
                     this metric is performing better.

                     DECREASE means that a variation with a lower  number  for
                     this metric is performing better.

                 metricDefinition -> (structure)
                     A structure that contains details about the metric.

                     entityIdKey -> (string)
                        The  entity,  such  as a user or session, that does an
                        action that causes a metric value to be recorded.

                     eventPattern -> (string)
                        The EventBridge event pattern  that  defines  how  the
                        metric is recorded.

                        For more information about EventBridge event patterns,
                        see Amazon EventBridge event patterns .

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of the metric.

                     unitLabel -> (string)
                        The label for the units that the metric is  measuring.

                     valueKey -> (string)
                        The value that is tracked to produce the metric.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the experiment.

          onlineAbDefinition -> (structure)
              A  structure  that contains the configuration of which variation
              to use as the "control" version. The "control" version  is  used
              for comparison with other variations. This structure also speci-
              fies how much experiment traffic is allocated to each variation.

              controlTreatmentName -> (string)
                 The  name of the variation that is the default variation that
                 the other variations are compared to.

              treatmentWeights -> (map)
                 A set of key-value pairs. The keys are variation  names,  and
                 the  values  are  the  portion  of  experiment  traffic to be
                 assigned to that variation. The traffic portion is  specified
                 in  thousandths of a percent, so 20,000 for a variation would
                 allocate 20% of the experiment traffic to that variation.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (long)

          project -> (string)
              The name or ARN of the project that contains this experiment.

          randomizationSalt -> (string)
              This value is used when Evidently assigns a particular user ses-
              sion  to  the  experiment. It helps create a randomization ID to
              determine which variation the user session is served. This  ran-
              domization  ID  is a combination of the entity ID and randomiza-
              tionSalt .

          samplingRate -> (long)
              In thousandths of a percent, the amount of the  available  audi-
              ence  that  is allocated to this experiment. The available audi-
              ence is the total audience minus  the  audience  that  you  have
              allocated to overrides or current launches of this feature.

              This  is  represented in thousandths of a percent, so a value of
              10,000 is 10% of the available audience.

          schedule -> (structure)
              A structure that contains the time and date that Evidently  com-
              pleted the analysis of the experiment.

              analysisCompleteTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  and  date that Evidently completed the analysis of
                 the experiment.

          status -> (string)
              The current state of the experiment.

          statusReason -> (string)
              If the experiment was stopped,  this  is  the  string  that  was
              entered by the person who stopped the experiment, to explain why
              it was stopped.

          tags -> (map)
              The list of tag keys and values associated with this experiment.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          treatments -> (list)
              An  array  of structures that describe the configuration of each
              feature variation used in the experiment.

              (structure)
                 A structure that defines one treatment in  an  experiment.  A
                 treatment  is a variation of the feature that you are includ-
                 ing in the experiment.

                 description -> (string)
                     The description of the treatment.

                 featureVariations -> (map)
                     The feature variation used for this treatment. This is  a
                     key-value  pair.  The  key  is  the feature name, and the
                     value is the variation name.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of this treatment.

          type -> (string)
              The type of this  experiment.  Currently,  this  value  must  be
              aws.experiment.onlineab .
