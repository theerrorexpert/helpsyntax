LIST-FEATURES()                                                LIST-FEATURES()



NAME
       list-features -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  configuration  details about all the features in the specified
       project.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-features is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: features

SYNOPSIS
            list-features
          --project <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --project (string)
          The name or ARN of the project to return the feature list from.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       features -> (list)
          An array of structures that contain the configuration details of the
          features in the specified project.

          (structure)
              This  structure contains information about one Evidently feature
              in your account.

              arn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the feature.

              createdTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the feature is created.

              defaultVariation -> (string)
                 The name of the variation that is used as the default  varia-
                 tion.  The  default  variation is served to users who are not
                 allocated to any ongoing launches or experiments of this fea-
                 ture.

              evaluationRules -> (list)
                 An array of structures that define

                 (structure)
                     A structure that contains the information about an evalu-
                     ation rule for this feature, if it is used in a launch or
                     experiment.

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of the experiment or launch.

                     type -> (string)
                        This value is aws.evidently.splits if this is an eval-
                        uation  rule  for  a  launch,  and  it   is   aws.evi-
                        dently.onlineab  if  this is an evaluation rule for an
                        experiment.

              evaluationStrategy -> (string)
                 If this value is ALL_RULES , the traffic allocation specified
                 by any ongoing launches or experiments is being used. If this
                 is DEFAULT_VARIATION , the default variation is being  served
                 to all users.

              lastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the feature was most recently updated.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the feature.

              project -> (string)
                 The name or ARN of the project that contains the feature.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  token  to  use in a subsequent ListFeatures operation to return
          the next set of results.
