UPDATE-PROJECT-DATA-DELIVERY()                  UPDATE-PROJECT-DATA-DELIVERY()



NAME
       update-project-data-delivery -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the data storage options for this project. If you store evalua-
       tion events, you an keep them and analyze them  on  your  own.  If  you
       choose  not  to  store  evaluation events, Evidently deletes them after
       using them to produce metrics and other experiment results that you can
       view.

       You  can't  specify  both  cloudWatchLogs and s3Destination in the same
       operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-project-data-delivery
          [--cloud-watch-logs <value>]
          --project <value>
          [--s3-destination <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cloud-watch-logs (structure)
          A structure containing the CloudWatch Logs log group where you  want
          to store evaluation events.

          logGroup -> (string)
              The  name  of  the log group where the project stores evaluation
              events.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          logGroup=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "logGroup": "string"
          }

       --project (string)
          The name or ARN of the project that you  want  to  modify  the  data
          storage options for.

       --s3-destination (structure)
          A  structure  containing  the S3 bucket name and bucket prefix where
          you want to store evaluation events.

          bucket -> (string)
              The name of the bucket  in  which  Evidently  stores  evaluation
              events.

          prefix -> (string)
              The bucket prefix in which Evidently stores evaluation events.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          bucket=string,prefix=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "bucket": "string",
            "prefix": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              cloudWatchLogs -> (structure)
                 If the project stores evaluation events in  CloudWatch  Logs,
                 this structure stores the log group name.
