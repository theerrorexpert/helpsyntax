OPTIONS
       --base-stat (string)
          The  statistic  used  to calculate experiment results. Currently the
          only valid value is mean , which uses the mean of the collected val-
          ues as the statistic.

          Possible values:

          o Mean

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The date and time that the experiment ended, if it is completed.

       --experiment (string)
          The name of the experiment to retrieve the results of.

       --metric-names (list)
          The names of the experiment metrics that you want to see the results
          of.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --period (long)
          In seconds, the amount of time to aggregate results together.

       --project (string)
          The name or ARN of the project that contains the experiment that you
          want to see the results of.

       --report-names (list)
          The  names  of  the  report  types  that you want to see. Currently,
          BayesianInference is the only valid value.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            BayesianInference

       --result-stats (list)
          The statistics that you want to see in the returned results.

          o PValue specifies to use p-values for the  results.  A  p-value  is
            used in hypothesis testing to measure how often you are willing to
            make a mistake in rejecting the null hypothesis. A  general  prac-
            tice is to reject the null hypothesis and declare that the results
            are statistically significant when the p-value is less than  0.05.

          o ConfidenceInterval   specifies   a  confidence  interval  for  the
            results. The confidence interval represents the  range  of  values
            for  the  chosen metric that is likely to contain the true differ-
            ence between the baseStat of a variation and  the  baseline.  Evi-
            dently returns the 95% confidence interval.

          o TreatmentEffect  is  the  difference in the statistic specified by
            the baseStat parameter between  each  variation  and  the  default
            variation.

          o BaseStat  returns  the statistical values collected for the metric
            for each variation. The statistic uses the same  statistic  speci-
            fied  in  the baseStat parameter. Therefore, if baseStat is mean ,
            this returns the mean of the values collected for each  variation.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            BaseStat
            TreatmentEffect
            ConfidenceInterval
            PValue

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The date and time that the experiment started.

       --treatment-names (list)
          The  names  of  the  experiment  treatments that you want to see the
          results for.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
