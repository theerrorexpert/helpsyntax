LIST-EXPERIMENTS()                                          LIST-EXPERIMENTS()



NAME
       list-experiments -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  configuration  details about all the experiments in the speci-
       fied project.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-experiments is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: experiments

SYNOPSIS
            list-experiments
          --project <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --project (string)
          The name or ARN of the project to return the experiment list from.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 An array of structures that defines the metrics used for  the

                     iment.

                     desiredChange -> (string)
                        INCREASE means that a variation with a  higher  number
                        for this metric is performing better.

                            an  action  that  causes  a  metric  value  to  be
                            recorded.

                        eventPattern -> (string)
                            The EventBridge event pattern that defines how the
                            metric is recorded.

                            For  more information about EventBridge event pat-
                            terns, see Amazon EventBridge event patterns .

                        name -> (string)

                        unitLabel -> (string)
                            The label for the units that the metric is measur-
                            ing.

                        valueKey -> (string)

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the experiment.

              onlineAbDefinition -> (structure)
                 A  structure  that contains the configuration of which varia-
                 tion to use as the "control" version. The  "control"  version
                 is  used for comparison with other variations. This structure
                 also specifies how much experiment traffic  is  allocated  to
                 each variation.

                 controlTreatmentName -> (string)
                     The  name  of the variation that is the default variation
                     that the other variations are compared to.

                 treatmentWeights -> (map)
                     A set of key-value pairs. The keys are  variation  names,
                     and  the  values are the portion of experiment traffic to
                     be assigned to that variation.  The  traffic  portion  is
                     specified  in  thousandths  of a percent, so 20,000 for a
                     variation would allocate 20% of the experiment traffic to
                     that variation.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (long)

              project -> (string)
                 The name or ARN of the project that contains this experiment.

              randomizationSalt -> (string)
                 This value is used when Evidently assigns a  particular  user
                 session to the experiment. It helps create a randomization ID
                 to determine which variation the user session is served. This
                 randomization  ID  is a combination of the entity ID and ran-
                 domizationSalt .

              samplingRate -> (long)
                 In thousandths of a percent,  the  amount  of  the  available
                 audience  that is allocated to this experiment. The available
                 audience is the total audience minus the  audience  that  you
                 have  allocated to overrides or current launches of this fea-
                 ture.

                 This is represented in thousandths of a percent, so  a  value
                 of 10,000 is 10% of the available audience.

              schedule -> (structure)
                 A  structure  that  contains the time and date that Evidently
                 completed the analysis of the experiment.

                 analysisCompleteTime -> (timestamp)
                     The time and date that Evidently completed  the  analysis
                     of the experiment.

              status -> (string)
                 The current state of the experiment.

              statusReason -> (string)
                 If  the  experiment  was stopped, this is the string that was
                 entered by the person who stopped the experiment, to  explain
                 why it was stopped.

              tags -> (map)
                 The  list of tag keys and values associated with this experi-
                 ment.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              treatments -> (list)
                 An array of structures that  describe  the  configuration  of
                 each feature variation used in the experiment.

                 (structure)
                     A  structure that defines one treatment in an experiment.
                     A treatment is a variation of the feature  that  you  are
                     including in the experiment.

                     description -> (string)
                        The description of the treatment.

                     featureVariations -> (map)
                        The feature variation used for this treatment. This is
                        a key-value pair. The key is the feature name, and the
                        value is the variation name.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (string)

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of this treatment.

              type -> (string)
                 The  type  of  this experiment. Currently, this value must be
                 aws.experiment.onlineab .

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token to use in a subsequent ListExperiments operation to return
          the next set of results.
