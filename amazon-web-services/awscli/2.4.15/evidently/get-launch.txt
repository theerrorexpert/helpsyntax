GET-LAUNCH()                                                      GET-LAUNCH()



NAME
       get-launch -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the details about one launch. You must already know the launch
       name. To retrieve a list of launches in your account, use  ListLaunches
       .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-launch
          --launch <value>
          --project <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --launch (string)
          The name of the launch that you want to see the details of.

       --project (string)
          The name or ARN of the project that contains the launch.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     A structure that defines the metric.

                        The entity, such as a user or session,  that  does  an

                        The  EventBridge  event  pattern  that defines how the
                        metric is recorded.

              This value is used when Evidently assigns a particular user ses-
              sion  to the launch, to help create a randomization ID to deter-
              mine which variation the user session is served. This randomiza-
              tion  ID is a combination of the entity ID and randomizationSalt
              .

          scheduledSplitsDefinition -> (structure)
              An array of structures that define the traffic  allocation  per-

              launch.

              steps -> (list)
                 An array of structures that  define  the  traffic  allocation
                 percentages  among the feature variations during each step of

                 (structure)
                     This structure defines the traffic allocation percentages
                     among the feature variations during one step of a launch,

                        variations  during one step of a launch. This is a set
                        of key-value pairs. The keys are variation names.  The
                        values represent the percentage of traffic to allocate
                        to that variation during this step.

              If  the  launch was stopped, this is the string that was entered
              by the person who stopped the launch,  to  explain  why  it  was
              stopped.
