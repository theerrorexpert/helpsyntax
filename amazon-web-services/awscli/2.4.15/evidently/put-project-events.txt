PUT-PROJECT-EVENTS()                                      PUT-PROJECT-EVENTS()



NAME
       put-project-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Sends  performance  events  to  Evidently.  These events can be used to
       evaluate a launch or an experiment.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-project-events
          --events <value>
          --project <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --events (list)
          An array of event structures that contain the performance data  that
          is being sent to Evidently.

          (structure)
              A  structure  that contains the information about one evaluation
              event or custom event sent to Evidently. This is a JSON payload.
              If  this  event  specifies a pre-defined event type, the payload
              must follow the defined event schema.

              data -> (string)
                 The event data.

              timestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp of the event.

              type -> (string)
                 aws.evidently.evaluation specifies an evaluation event, which
                 determines which feature variation that a user sees. aws.evi-
                 dently.custom specifies a custom event, which generates  met-
                 rics from user actions such as clicks and checkouts.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          data=string,timestamp=timestamp,type=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "data": "string",
              "timestamp": timestamp,
              "type": "aws.evidently.evaluation"|"aws.evidently.custom"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --project (string)
          The name or ARN of the project to write the events to.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       eventResults -> (list)
          A  structure  that contains Evidently's response to the sent events,
          including an event ID and error codes, if any.

          (structure)
              A structure that  contains  Evidently's  response  to  the  sent
              events, including an event ID and error codes, if any.

              errorCode -> (string)
                 If  the  PutProjectEvents  operation  has an error, the error
                 code is returned here.

              errorMessage -> (string)
                 If the PutProjectEvents operation has  an  error,  the  error
                 message is returned here.

              eventId -> (string)
                 A unique ID assigned to this PutProjectEvents operation.

       failedEventCount -> (integer)
          The number of events in the operation that could not be used by Evi-
          dently.
