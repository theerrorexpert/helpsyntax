          An optional description of the experiment.

       --experiment (string)
          The name of the experiment to update.

       --metric-goals (list)
          An array of structures that defines the metrics used for the experi-
          ment,  and  whether  a  higher or lower value for each metric is the
          goal.

          (structure)
              Use this structure to tell Evidently  whether  higher  or  lower
              values are desired for a metric that is used in an experiment.

              desiredChange -> (string)
                 INCREASE means that a variation with a higher number for this
                 metric is performing better.

                 DECREASE means that a variation with a lower number for  this
                 metric is performing better.

              metricDefinition -> (structure)
                 A structure that contains details about the metric.

                 entityIdKey -> (string)
                     The  entity,  such  as  a  user  or session, that does an
                     action that causes a metric  value  to  be  recorded.  An
                     example is userDetails.userID .

                 eventPattern -> (string)
                     The EventBridge event pattern that defines how the metric
                     is recorded.

                     For more information about  EventBridge  event  patterns,
                     see Amazon EventBridge event patterns .

                     The value that is tracked to produce the metric.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          desiredChange=string,metricDefinition={entityIdKey=string,eventPattern=string,name=string,unitLabel=string,valueKey=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "desiredChange": "INCREASE"|"DECREASE",
              "metricDefinition": {
                "entityIdKey": "string",
                "eventPattern": "string",
                "name": "string",
                "unitLabel": "string",
                "valueKey": "string"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --online-ab-config (structure)
          A structure that contains the configuration of which variation o use
          as the "control" version. The "control" version is used for compari-
          son  with  other  variations. This structure also specifies how much
          experiment traffic is allocated to each variation.

          controlTreatmentName -> (string)
              The name of the variation that is to be  the  default  variation
              that the other variations are compared to.

          treatmentWeights -> (map)
              A  set of key-value pairs. The keys are variation names, and the
              values are the portion of experiment traffic to be  assigned  to
              that  variation. Specify the traffic portion in thousandths of a
              percent, so 20,000 for a variation would  allocate  20%  of  the
              experiment traffic to that variation.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (long)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          controlTreatmentName=string,treatmentWeights={KeyName1=long,KeyName2=long}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "controlTreatmentName": "string",
            "treatmentWeights": {"string": long
              ...}
          }

       --project (string)
          The name or ARN of the project that contains the experiment that you
          want to update.

       --randomization-salt (string)
          When Evidently assigns a particular user session to  an  experiment,
          it must use a randomization ID to determine which variation the user
          session is served. This randomization ID is  a  combination  of  the
          entity  ID  and  randomizationSalt . If you omit randomizationSalt ,
          Evidently uses the experiment name as the randomizationSalt .

       --sampling-rate (long)
          The portion of the available audience that you want to  allocate  to
          this experiment, in thousandths of a percent. The available audience
          is the total audience minus the audience that you have allocated  to
          overrides or current launches of this feature.

          This  is represented in thousandths of a percent. For example, spec-
          ify 20,000 to allocate 20% of the available audience.

       --treatments (list)
          An array of structures that define the variations  being  tested  in
          the experiment.

          (structure)
              A  structure  that  defines  one  treatment  in an experiment. A
              treatment is a variation of the feature that you  are  including
              in the experiment.

              description -> (string)
                 A description for this treatment.

              feature -> (string)
                 The feature that this experiment is testing.

              name -> (string)
                 A name for this treatment.

              variation -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  variation to use as this treatment in the
                 experiment.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          description=string,feature=string,name=string,variation=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "description": "string",
              "feature": "string",
              "name": "string",
              "variation": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     INCREASE means that a variation with a higher number  for
                     this metric is performing better.

                     DECREASE  means  that a variation with a lower number for

                     valueKey -> (string)
                        The value that is tracked to produce the metric.

          name -> (string)

          onlineAbDefinition -> (structure)
              A structure that contains the configuration of  which  variation
              to  use  as the "control" version. The "control" version is used
              for comparison with other variations. This structure also speci-
              fies how much experiment traffic is allocated to each variation.

              controlTreatmentName -> (string)
                 The name of the variation that is the default variation  that
                 the other variations are compared to.

              treatmentWeights -> (map)
                 A  set  of key-value pairs. The keys are variation names, and
                 the values are  the  portion  of  experiment  traffic  to  be
                 assigned  to that variation. The traffic portion is specified
                 in thousandths of a percent, so 20,000 for a variation  would
                 allocate 20% of the experiment traffic to that variation.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (long)

          project -> (string)
              The name or ARN of the project that contains this experiment.

          randomizationSalt -> (string)
              This value is used when Evidently assigns a particular user ses-
              sion to the experiment. It helps create a  randomization  ID  to
              determine  which variation the user session is served. This ran-
              domization ID is a combination of the entity ID  and  randomiza-
              tionSalt .

          samplingRate -> (long)
              In  thousandths  of a percent, the amount of the available audi-
              ence that is allocated to this experiment. The  available  audi-
              ence  is  the  total  audience  minus the audience that you have
              allocated to overrides or current launches of this feature.

              This is represented in thousandths of a percent, so a  value  of
              10,000 is 10% of the available audience.

          schedule -> (structure)
              A  structure that contains the time and date that Evidently com-
              pleted the analysis of the experiment.

              entered by the person who stopped the experiment, to explain why
              it was stopped.

          tags -> (map)
              The list of tag keys and values associated with this experiment.

          treatments -> (list)
              An array of structures that describe the configuration  of  each
              feature variation used in the experiment.

              (structure)
                 A  structure  that  defines one treatment in an experiment. A
                 treatment is a variation of the feature that you are  includ-
                 ing in the experiment.

                 description -> (string)

                 featureVariations -> (map)
                     The  feature variation used for this treatment. This is a
                     key-value pair. The key is  the  feature  name,  and  the
                     value is the variation name.

                     key -> (string)
