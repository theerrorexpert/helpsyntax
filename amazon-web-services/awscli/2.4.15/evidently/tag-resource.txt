TAG-RESOURCE()                                                  TAG-RESOURCE()



NAME
       tag-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Assigns  one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified CloudWatch
       Evidently resource. Projects, features, launches, and  experiments  can
       be tagged.

       Tags  can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also
       use them to scope user permissions by granting  a  user  permission  to
       access or change only resources with certain tag values.

       Tags  don't  have  any  semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are
       interpreted strictly as strings of characters.

       You can use the TagResource action with a  resource  that  already  has
       tags.  If  you  specify  a  new  tag  key for the resource, this tag is
       appended to the list of tags associated with the alarm. If you  specify
       a  tag  key  that  is already associated with the resource, the new tag
       value that you specify replaces the previous value for that tag.

       You can associate as many as 50 tags with a resource.

SYNOPSIS
            tag-resource
          --resource-arn <value>
          --tags <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The ARN of the CloudWatch Evidently resource that you're adding tags
          to.

       --tags (map)
          The list of key-value pairs to associate with the resource.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
