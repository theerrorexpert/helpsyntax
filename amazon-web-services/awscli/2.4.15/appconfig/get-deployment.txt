NAME
       get-deployment -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information about a configuration deployment.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-deployment
          --application-id <value>
          --environment-id <value>
          --deployment-number <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The  ID  of the application that includes the deployment you want to
          get.

       --environment-id (string)
          The ID of the environment that includes the deployment you  want  to
          get.

       --deployment-number (integer)
          The sequence number of the deployment.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve deployment details

       The following get-deployment example lists details of the deployment to
       the application in the specified environment and deployment.

          aws appconfig get-deployment \
              --application-id 339ohji \
              --environment-id 54j1r29 \
              --deployment-number 1

       Output:
