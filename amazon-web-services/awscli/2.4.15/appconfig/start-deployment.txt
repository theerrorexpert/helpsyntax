DESCRIPTION

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-deployment
          --application-id <value>
          --environment-id <value>
          --deployment-strategy-id <value>
          --configuration-profile-id <value>
          --configuration-version <value>
          [--description <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The application ID.

       --environment-id (string)
          The environment ID.

       --deployment-strategy-id (string)
          The deployment strategy ID.

       --configuration-profile-id (string)
          The configuration profile ID.

       --configuration-version (string)
          The configuration version to deploy.

       --description (string)
          A description of the deployment.

       --tags (map)
          Metadata to assign to the deployment. Tags help organize and catego-
          rize your AppConfig resources. Each tag consists of  a  key  and  an
          optional value, both of which you define.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To start a configuration deployment

       The  following  start-deployment  example  starts  a  deployment to the
       application using the specified environment, deployment  strategy,  and
       configuration profile.

          aws appconfig start-deployment \
              --application-id 339ohji \
              --environment-id 54j1r29 \
              --deployment-strategy-id 1225qzk \
              --configuration-profile-id ur8hx2f \
              --configuration-version 1

       Output:
