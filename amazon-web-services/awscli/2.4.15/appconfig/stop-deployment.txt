STOP-DEPLOYMENT()                                            STOP-DEPLOYMENT()



NAME
       stop-deployment -

DESCRIPTION
       Stops a deployment. This API action works only on deployments that have
       a status of DEPLOYING . This action moves the deployment to a status of
       ROLLED_BACK .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            stop-deployment
          --application-id <value>
          --environment-id <value>
          --deployment-number <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The application ID.

       --environment-id (string)
          The environment ID.

       --deployment-number (integer)
          The sequence number of the deployment.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To stop configuration deployment

       The following stop-deployment example stops the deployment of an appli-
       cation configuration to the specified environment.

          aws appconfig stop-deployment \
              --application-id 339ohji \
              --environment-id 54j1r29 \
              --deployment-number 2

       Output:

          {
              "DeploymentNumber": 0,
              "DeploymentDurationInMinutes": 0,
              "GrowthFactor": 0.0,
              "FinalBakeTimeInMinutes": 0,
              "PercentageComplete": 0.0
          }

       AppConfig User Guide.

OUTPUT
       ApplicationId -> (string)
          The ID of the application that was deployed.

       EnvironmentId -> (string)
          The ID of the environment that was deployed.

       DeploymentStrategyId -> (string)
          The ID of the deployment strategy that was deployed.

       ConfigurationProfileId -> (string)
          The ID of the configuration profile that was deployed.

       DeploymentNumber -> (integer)
          The sequence number of the deployment.

       ConfigurationName -> (string)
          The name of the configuration.

       ConfigurationLocationUri -> (string)
          Information about the source location of the configuration.

       ConfigurationVersion -> (string)
          The configuration version that was deployed.

       Description -> (string)
          The description of the deployment.

       DeploymentDurationInMinutes -> (integer)
          Total amount of time the deployment lasted.

       GrowthType -> (string)
          The algorithm used to define how percentage grew over time.

       GrowthFactor -> (float)
          The percentage of targets to receive a deployed configuration during
          each interval.

       FinalBakeTimeInMinutes -> (integer)
          The amount of time that AppConfig monitored for alarms  before  con-
          sidering  the  deployment  to be complete and no longer eligible for
          automatic rollback.

       State -> (string)
          The state of the deployment.

       EventLog -> (list)
          A list containing all events  related  to  a  deployment.  The  most
          recent events are displayed first.

          (structure)
              An object that describes a deployment event.

              EventType -> (string)
                 The  type of deployment event. Deployment event types include
                 the start, stop, or completion of a deployment; a  percentage
                 update;  the start or stop of a bake period; and the start or
                 completion of a rollback.

              TriggeredBy -> (string)
                 The entity that triggered the deployment event. Events can be
                 triggered  by  a user, AppConfig, an Amazon CloudWatch alarm,
                 or an internal error.

              Description -> (string)
                 A description of the deployment event. Descriptions  include,
                 but are not limited to, the user account or the Amazon Cloud-
                 Watch alarm ARN that initiated a rollback, the percentage  of
                 hosts  that  received  the  deployment,  or in the case of an
                 internal error, a recommendation to attempt a new deployment.

              OccurredAt -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the event occurred.

       PercentageComplete -> (float)
          The percentage of targets for which the deployment is available.

       StartedAt -> (timestamp)
          The time the deployment started.

       CompletedAt -> (timestamp)
          The time the deployment completed.
