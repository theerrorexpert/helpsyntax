GET-ENVIRONMENT()                                            GET-ENVIRONMENT()



NAME
       get-environment -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information about an environment. An environment is a logical
       deployment group of AppConfig applications, such as applications  in  a
       Production  environment or in an EU_Region environment. Each configura-
       tion deployment targets an environment. You can enable one or more Ama-
       zon CloudWatch alarms for an environment. If an alarm is triggered dur-
       ing a deployment, AppConfig roles back the configuration.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-environment
          --application-id <value>
          --environment-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The ID of the application that includes the environment you want  to
          get.

       --environment-id (string)
          The ID of the environment that you want to get.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve environment details

       The  following get-environment example returns the details and state of
       the specified environment.

          aws appconfig get-environment \
              --application-id 339ohji \
              --environment-id 54j1r29

       Output:

          {
              "ApplicationId": "339ohji",
              "Id": "54j1r29",
              "Name": "Example-Environment",
              "State": "ReadyForDeployment"
          }

       For more information, see Step 2: Creating an environment  in  the  AWS
       AppConfig User Guide.

OUTPUT
       ApplicationId -> (string)
