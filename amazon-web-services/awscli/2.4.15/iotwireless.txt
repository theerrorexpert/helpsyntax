NAME
       iotwireless -

DESCRIPTION
       AWS  IoT  Wireless provides bi-directional communication between inter-
       net-connected wireless devices and  the  AWS  Cloud.  To  onboard  both
       LoRaWAN  and  Sidewalk  devices  to  AWS IoT, use the IoT Wireless API.
       These wireless devices use the Low Power Wide Area  Networking  (LPWAN)
       communication protocol to communicate with AWS IoT.

       Using  the API, you can perform create, read, update, and delete opera-
       tions for your wireless devices, gateways, destinations, and  profiles.
       After  onboarding  your  devices, you can use the API operations to set
       log levels and monitor your devices with CloudWatch.

       You can also use the API operations  to  create  multicast  groups  and
       schedule  a multicast session for sending a downlink message to devices
       in the group. By using Firmware Updates Over-The-Air (FUOTA) API opera-
       tions, you can create a FUOTA task and schedule a session to update the
       firmware of individual devices or an entire group of devices in a  mul-
       ticast group.
