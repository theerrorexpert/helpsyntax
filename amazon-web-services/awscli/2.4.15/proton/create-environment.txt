CREATE-ENVIRONMENT()                                      CREATE-ENVIRONMENT()



NAME
       create-environment -

DESCRIPTION
       Deploy  a  new  environment.  An  Proton environment is created from an
       environment template that defines infrastructure and resources that can
       be shared across services.
          You can provision environments using the following methods:

       o Standard  provisioning:  Proton  makes direct calls to provision your
         resources.

       o Pull request provisioning: Proton makes pull requests on your reposi-
         tory to provide compiled infrastructure as code (IaC) files that your
         IaC engine uses to provision resources.

       For more information, see the Environments in the Proton  Administrator
       Guide.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          A  description of the environment that's being created and deployed.

       --environment-account-connection-id (string)
          The ID of the environment account connection  that  you  provide  if
          you're  provisioning your environment infrastructure resources to an
          environment account. You must include either the environmentAccount-
          ConnectionId  or  protonServiceRoleArn  parameter and value and omit
          the provisioningRepository parameter and values. For  more  informa-
          tion,  see Environment account connections in the Proton Administra-
          tor guide .

       --name (string)
          The name of the environment.

       --proton-service-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the  Proton  service  role  that
          allows  Proton  to  make calls to other services on your behalf. You
          must include either the environmentAccountConnectionId or protonSer-
          viceRoleArn  parameter and value and omit the provisioningRepository
          parameter when you use standard provisioning.

       --provisioning-repository (structure)
          The repository that you provide with pull request  provisioning.  If
          you provide this parameter, you must omit the environmentAccountCon-
          nectionId and protonServiceRoleArn parameters.

          WARNING:
              Provisioning by pull request is currently in feature preview and
              is  only  usable with Terraform based Proton Templates. To learn
              more about Amazon Web Services Feature Preview terms , see  sec-
              tion 2 on Beta and Previews.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          branch=string,name=string,provider=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "branch": "string",
            "name": "string",
            "provider": "GITHUB"|"GITHUB_ENTERPRISE"|"BITBUCKET"
          }

       --spec (string)
          A link to a YAML formatted spec file that provides inputs as defined
          in the environment template bundle schema file.  For  more  informa-
          tion, see Environments in the Proton Administrator Guide .

       --tags (list)
          Create  tags  for your environment. For more information, see Proton
          resources and tagging in the Proton Administrator  Guide  or  Proton
          User Guide .

          (structure)
              A description of a resource tag.

              key -> (string)
                 The key of the resource tag.

              value -> (string)
                 The value of the resource tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --template-major-version (string)
          The major version of the environment template.

       --template-minor-version (string)
          The minor version of the environment template.

       --template-name (string)

          Environment Templates in the Proton Administrator Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
