       line.  For  more  information, see Services in the Proton Administrator
       Guide and Services in the Proton User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --branch-name (string)
          The name of the code repository branch that holds  the  code  that's
          deployed  in  Proton.  Don't  include this parameter if your service
          template doesn't include a service pipeline.

       --description (string)
          A description of the Proton service.

       --name (string)
          The service name.

       --repository-connection-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  repository  connection.  For
          more  information,  see  Set  up repository connection in the Proton
          Administrator Guide and Setting up with Proton in  the  Proton  User
          Guide  .  Don't  include  this  parameter  if  your service template
          doesn't include a service pipeline.

       --repository-id (string)
          The ID of the code repository. Don't include this parameter if  your
          service template doesn't include a service pipeline.

       --spec (string)
          A link to a spec file that provides inputs as defined in the service
          template bundle schema file. The spec file is in YAML  format.  Dont
          include  pipeline inputs in the spec if your service template doesnt
          include a service pipeline. For more information, see Create a  ser-
          vice  in  the Proton Administrator Guide and Create a service in the
          Proton User Guide .

       --tags (list)
          Create tags for your  service.  For  more  information,  see  Proton
          resources  and  tagging  in the Proton Administrator Guide or Proton
          User Guide .

          (structure)
              A description of a resource tag.

              key -> (string)
                 The key of the resource tag.

              value -> (string)
                 The value of the resource tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --template-major-version (string)
          The major version of the service template that was  used  to  create
          the service.

       --template-minor-version (string)
          The  minor  version  of the service template that was used to create
          the service.

       --template-name (string)
          The name of the service template that's used to create the  service.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a service

       The  following  create-service example creates a service with a service
       pipeline.

          aws proton create-service \
              --name "MySimpleService" \
              --template-name "fargate-service" \
              --template-major-version "1" \
              --branch-name "mainline" \
              --repository-connection-arn "arn:aws:codestar-connections:region-id:account-id:connection/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111" \
              --repository-id "myorg/myapp" \
              --spec file://spec.yaml

       Contents of spec.yaml:

          proton: ServiceSpec

          pipeline:
              my_sample_pipeline_required_input: "hello"

                      my_sample_service_instance_required_input: "hi"
                      my_sample_service_instance_optional_input: "ho"

       Output:

          {
              "service": {
                  "arn": "arn:aws:proton:region-id:123456789012:service/MySimpleService",
