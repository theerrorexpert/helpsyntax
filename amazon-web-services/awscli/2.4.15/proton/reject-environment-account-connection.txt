NAME
       reject-environment-account-connection -

DESCRIPTION
       In  a management account, reject an environment account connection from
       another environment account.

       After you reject an environment account connection request, you wont be
       able to accept or use the rejected environment account connection.

       You  cant reject an environment account connection that is connected to
       an environment.

       For more information, see Environment account connections in the Proton
       Administrator guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            reject-environment-account-connection
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The ID of the environment account connection to reject.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
