NAME
       update-service-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Update a service instance.

       There  are  four  modes for updating a service instance as described in
       the following. The deploymentType field defines the mode.
          NONE

       In this mode, a deployment doesn't occur. Only the  requested  metadata
       parameters are updated.
          CURRENT_VERSION

       In this mode, the service instance is deployed and updated with the new
       spec that you provide. Only  requested  parameters  are  updated.  Dont
       include  minor  or  major  version parameters when you use this deploy-
       ment-type .
          MINOR_VERSION

       In this mode, the service instance is deployed  and  updated  with  the
       published, recommended (latest) minor version of the current major ver-
       sion in use, by default. You can also specify a different minor version
       of the current major version in use.
          MAJOR_VERSION

       In  this  mode,  the  service instance is deployed and updated with the
       published, recommended (latest) major and minor version of the  current
       template,  by  default.  You can also specify a different major version
       that is higher than the major  version  in  use  and  a  minor  version
       (optional).

OPTIONS
       --deployment-type (string)
          The deployment type.

          There are four modes for updating a service instance as described in
          the following. The deploymentType field defines the mode.
              NONE

          In this mode, a deployment doesn't occur. Only the  requested  meta-
          data parameters are updated.
              CURRENT_VERSION

          In  this mode, the service instance is deployed and updated with the
          new spec that you provide. Only requested  parameters  are  updated.
          Dont  include  minor  or  major version parameters when you use this
          deployment-type .
              MINOR_VERSION

          In this mode, the service instance is deployed and updated with  the
          published,  recommended  (latest) minor version of the current major
          version in use, by default. You can also specify a  different  minor
          version of the current major version in use.
              MAJOR_VERSION

          In  this mode, the service instance is deployed and updated with the
          published, recommended (latest) major and minor version of the  cur-
          rent  template,  by  default. You can also specify a different major
          version that is higher than the major version in  use  and  a  minor
          version (optional).

          Possible values:

          o NONE

          o CURRENT_VERSION

          o MINOR_VERSION

          o MAJOR_VERSION

       --name (string)
          The name of the service instance to update.

       --service-name (string)
          The name of the service that the service instance belongs to.

       --spec (string)
          The  formatted  specification  that  defines  the  service  instance
          update.

       --template-major-version (string)
          The major version of the service template to update.

       --template-minor-version (string)
          The minor version of the service template to update.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update a service instance to a new minor version

       The  following  update-service-instance  example  updates   a   service
       instance to a new minor version of its service template that adds a new
       instance named "my-other-instance" with a new required input.

          aws proton update-service-instance \
              --service-name "simple-svc" \
              --spec "file://service-spec.yaml " \
              --template-major-version "1" \
              --template-minor-version "1" \
              --deployment-type "MINOR_VERSION" \
              --name "instance-one"

       Contents of service-spec.yaml:

          proton: ServiceSpec
          pipeline:
              my_sample_pipeline_optional_input: "abc"
              my_sample_pipeline_required_input: "123"
          instances:
              - name: "instance-one"
                  environment: "simple-env"
                  spec:
                      my_sample_service_instance_optional_input: "def"
                      my_sample_service_instance_required_input: "456"
              - name: "my-other-instance"
                  environment: "simple-env"
                  spec:
                      my_sample_service_instance_required_input: "789"

       Output:
