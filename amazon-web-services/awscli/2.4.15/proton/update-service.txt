NAME
       update-service -

DESCRIPTION
       Edit  a  service  description  or  use a spec to add and delete service
       instances.

       NOTE:
          Existing service instances and the service pipeline can't be  edited
          using this API. They can only be deleted.

       Use the description parameter to modify the description.

       Edit the spec parameter to add or delete instances.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-service
          [--description <value>]
          --name <value>
          [--spec <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          The edited service description.

       --name (string)
          The name of the service to edit.

       --spec (string)
          Lists  the  service  instances  to  add  and  the  existing  service
          instances to remain. Omit the existing service instances  to  delete
          from the list. Don't include edits to the existing service instances
          or pipeline. For more information, see Edit a service in the  Proton
          Administrator Guide or the Proton User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update a service

       The following update-service example edits a service description.

          aws proton update-service \
              --name "MySimpleService" \
              --description "Edit by updating description"

       Output:

          {
              "service": {
