NAME
       update-service-pipeline -

DESCRIPTION
       Update the service pipeline.

       There  are  four  modes for updating a service pipeline as described in
       the following. The deploymentType field defines the mode.
          NONE

       In this mode, a deployment doesn't occur. Only the  requested  metadata
       parameters are updated.
          CURRENT_VERSION

       In this mode, the service pipeline is deployed and updated with the new
       spec that you provide. Only  requested  parameters  are  updated.  Dont
       include  minor  or  major  version parameters when you use this deploy-
       ment-type .
          MINOR_VERSION

       In this mode, the service pipeline is deployed  and  updated  with  the
       published, recommended (latest) minor version of the current major ver-
       sion in use, by default. You can also specify a different minor version
       of the current major version in use.
          MAJOR_VERSION

       In  this  mode,  the  service pipeline is deployed and updated with the
       published, recommended (latest) major and minor version of the  current
       template  by  default.  You  can also specify a different major version
       that is higher than the major  version  in  use  and  a  minor  version
       (optional).

OPTIONS
       --deployment-type (string)
          The deployment type.

          There are four modes for updating a service pipeline as described in
          the following. The deploymentType field defines the mode.
              NONE

          In this mode, a deployment doesn't occur. Only the  requested  meta-
          data parameters are updated.
              CURRENT_VERSION

          In  this mode, the service pipeline is deployed and updated with the
          new spec that you provide. Only requested  parameters  are  updated.
          Dont  include  minor  or  major version parameters when you use this
          deployment-type .
              MINOR_VERSION

          In this mode, the service pipeline is deployed and updated with  the
          published,  recommended  (latest) minor version of the current major
          version in use, by default. You can also specify a  different  minor
          version of the current major version in use.
              MAJOR_VERSION

          In  this mode, the service pipeline is deployed and updated with the
          published, recommended (latest) major and minor version of the  cur-
          rent  template,  by  default. You can also specify a different major
          version that is higher than the major version in  use  and  a  minor
          version (optional).

          Possible values:

          o NONE

          o CURRENT_VERSION

          o MINOR_VERSION

          o MAJOR_VERSION

       --service-name (string)
          The name of the service to that the pipeline is associated with.

       --spec (string)
          The spec for the service pipeline to update.

       --template-major-version (string)
          The  major  version  of the service template that was used to create
          the service that the pipeline is associated with.

       --template-minor-version (string)
          The minor version of the service template that was  used  to  create
          the service that the pipeline is associated with.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update a service pipeline

       The  following  update-service-pipeline example updates a service pipe-
       line to a new minor version of its service template.

          aws proton update-service-pipeline \
              --service-name "simple-svc" \
              --spec "file://service-spec.yaml" \
              --template-major-version "1" \
              --template-minor-version "1" \
              --deployment-type "MINOR_VERSION"

       Output:

          {
              "pipeline": {
