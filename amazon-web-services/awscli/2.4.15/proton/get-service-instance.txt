GET-SERVICE-INSTANCE()                                  GET-SERVICE-INSTANCE()



NAME
       get-service-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Get  detail  data  for  a  service  instance.  A service instance is an
       instantiation of service template, which is running in a specific envi-
       ronment.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-service-instance
          --name <value>
          --service-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The  name of a service instance that you want to get the detail data
          for.

       --service-name (string)
          The name of the service that the service instance belongs to.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get service instance details

       The following get-service-instance example gets detail data for a  ser-
       vice instance.

          aws proton get-service-instance \
              --name "instance-one" \
              --service-name "simple-svc"

       Output:

          {
              "serviceInstance": {
