LIST-RECIPES()                                                  LIST-RECIPES()



NAME
       list-recipes -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all of the DataBrew recipes that are defined.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-recipes is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: Recipes

SYNOPSIS
            list-recipes
          [--recipe-version <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --recipe-version (string)
          Return only those recipes with a version identifier of  LATEST_WORK-
          ING  or  LATEST_PUBLISHED . If RecipeVersion is omitted, ListRecipes
          returns all of the LATEST_PUBLISHED recipe versions.

          Valid values: LATEST_WORKING | LATEST_PUBLISHED

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              Steps -> (list)
                 A list of steps that are defined by the recipe.

                 (structure)
                     Represents  a  single  step  from a DataBrew recipe to be
                     performed.

                     Action -> (structure)
                        The particular action to be performed  in  the  recipe
                        step.

                        Operation -> (string)
                            The  name of a valid DataBrew transformation to be

                     ConditionExpressions -> (list)
                        One or more conditions that must be met for the recipe
                        step to succeed.

                        NOTE:
                            All of the conditions in the array must be met. In
                            other words, all of the conditions  must  be  com-
                            bined using a logical AND operation.

                        (structure)
                            Represents  an individual condition that evaluates
                            to true or false.

                            Conditions  are  used  with  recipe  actions.  The
                            action  is  only performed for column values where
                            the condition evaluates to true.

                            If a recipe requires more than one condition, then
                            the  recipe must specify multiple ConditionExpres-
                            sion elements. Each condition is  applied  to  the
                            rows  in a dataset first, before the recipe action
                            is performed.

                            Condition -> (string)
                               A specific  condition  to  apply  to  a  recipe
                               action. For more information, see Recipe struc-
                               ture in the Glue DataBrew Developer Guide .

                            Value -> (string)
                               A value that the condition must evaluate to for
                               the condition to succeed.

                            TargetColumn -> (string)
                               A column to apply this condition to.

              Tags -> (map)
                 Metadata tags that have been applied to the recipe.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              RecipeVersion -> (string)
                 The identifier for the version for the recipe. Must be one of
                 the following:

                 o Numeric version (X.Y ) - X and Y stand for major and  minor
                   version  numbers.  The  maximum length of each is 6 digits,
                   and neither can be  negative  values.  Both  X  and  Y  are
                   required, and "0.0" isn't a valid version.

                 o LATEST_WORKING - the most recent valid version being devel-
                   oped in a DataBrew project.

                 o LATEST_PUBLISHED - the most recent published version.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token that you can use in a subsequent call to retrieve  the  next
          set of results.



                                                                LIST-RECIPES()
