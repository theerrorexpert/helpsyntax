SYNOPSIS
            update-recipe
          [--description <value>]
          --name <value>
          [--steps <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          A description of the recipe.

       --name (string)
          The name of the recipe to be updated.

       --steps (list)
          One or more steps to be performed by the recipe. Each step  consists
          of  an action, and the conditions under which the action should suc-
          ceed.

          (structure)
              Represents a single step from a DataBrew recipe to be performed.

              Action -> (structure)
                 The particular action to be performed in the recipe step.

                 Operation -> (string)
                     The  name  of  a valid DataBrew transformation to be per-
                     formed on the data.

                 Parameters -> (map)
                     Contextual parameters for the transformation.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

              ConditionExpressions -> (list)
                 One or more conditions that must be met for the  recipe  step
                 to succeed.

                 NOTE:
                     All  of the conditions in the array must be met. In other
                     words, all of the conditions must  be  combined  using  a
                     logical AND operation.

                 (structure)
                     Represents an individual condition that evaluates to true
                     or false.

                     Conditions are used with recipe actions.  The  action  is
                     only  performed  for  column  values  where the condition
                     evaluates to true.

                     If a recipe requires more than one  condition,  then  the
                     recipe  must  specify  multiple  ConditionExpression ele-
                     ments. Each condition is applied to the rows in a dataset
                     first, before the recipe action is performed.

                     Condition -> (string)
                        A  specific condition to apply to a recipe action. For
                        more information, see Recipe  structure  in  the  Glue
                        DataBrew Developer Guide .

                     Value -> (string)
                        A  value  that  the condition must evaluate to for the
                        condition to succeed.

                     TargetColumn -> (string)
                        A column to apply this condition to.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Action={Operation=string,Parameters={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string}},ConditionExpressions=[{Condition=string,Value=string,TargetColumn=string},{Condition=string,Value=string,TargetColumn=string}] ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Action": {
                "Operation": "string",
                "Parameters": {"string": "string"
                  ...}
              },
              "ConditionExpressions": [
                {
                  "Condition": "string",
                  "Value": "string",
                  "TargetColumn": "string"
                }
                ...
              ]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Name -> (string)
          The name of the recipe that was updated.
