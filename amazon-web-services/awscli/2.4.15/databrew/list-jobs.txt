LIST-JOBS()                                                        LIST-JOBS()



NAME
       list-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all of the DataBrew jobs that are defined.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in
       order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagi-
       nation  by  providing  the --no-paginate argument.  When using --output
       text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: Jobs

SYNOPSIS
            list-jobs
          [--dataset-name <value>]
          [--project-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dataset-name (string)
          The name of a dataset. Using this parameter indicates to return only
          those jobs that act on the specified dataset.

       --project-name (string)
          The name of a project. Using this parameter indicates to return only
          those jobs that are associated with the specified project.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     o FULL_DATASET  -  The  profile  job is run on the entire
                       dataset.

                     o CUSTOM_ROWS - The profile job is run on the  number  of
                       rows specified in the Size parameter.

                 Size -> (long)
                     The Size parameter is only required when the mode is CUS-
                     TOM_ROWS. The profile job is run on the specified  number
                     of rows. The maximum value for size is Long.MAX_VALUE.

                     Long.MAX_VALUE = 9223372036854775807

                     the  Rulesets  and Validation Mode to be used in the pro-
                     file job. When ValidationConfiguration is null, the  pro-
                     file job will run without data quality validation.

                        selected  ruleset  should  be  the  same as the Amazon
                        Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset that is  associated
                        with the profile job.

                     ValidationMode -> (string)
