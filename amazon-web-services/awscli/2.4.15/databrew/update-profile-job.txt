OPTIONS
       --configuration (structure)
          Configuration  for  profile jobs. Used to select columns, do evalua-
          tions, and override default parameters of evaluations. When configu-
          ration is null, the profile job will run with default settings.

          DatasetStatisticsConfiguration -> (structure)
              Configuration for inter-column evaluations. Configuration can be
              used to select evaluations and override  parameters  of  evalua-
              tions. When configuration is undefined, the profile job will run
              all supported inter-column evaluations.

              IncludedStatistics -> (list)
                 List of included evaluations. When the list is undefined, all
                 supported evaluations will be included.

                 (string)

              Overrides -> (list)
                 List of overrides for evaluations.

                 (structure)
                     Override of a particular evaluation for a profile job.

                     Statistic -> (string)
                        The name of an evaluation

                     Parameters -> (map)

          ProfileColumns -> (list)
              List of column selectors. ProfileColumns can be used  to  select
              columns  from the dataset. When ProfileColumns is undefined, the
              profile job will profile all supported columns.

              (structure)
                 Selector of a column from a dataset for profile job  configu-
                 ration. One selector includes either a column name or a regu-
                 lar expression.

                 Regex -> (string)
                     A regular  expression  for  selecting  a  column  from  a

          ColumnStatisticsConfigurations -> (list)
              List  of configurations for column evaluations. ColumnStatistic-
              sConfigurations are used  to  select  evaluations  and  override
              parameters  of  evaluations for particular columns. When Column-
              StatisticsConfigurations is undefined, the profile job will pro-
              file all supported columns and run all supported evaluations.

              (structure)
                 Configuration  for  column  evaluations  for  a  profile job.
                 ColumnStatisticsConfiguration can be used to  select  evalua-
                 tions  and  override parameters of evaluations for particular
                 columns.

          is not provided for profile jobs, the default value  will  be  used.
          The  default  value  is CUSTOM_ROWS for the mode parameter and 20000
          for the size parameter.

          Mode -> (string)

              one of the following:

              o FULL_DATASET - The profile job is run on the entire dataset.

              o CUSTOM_ROWS - The profile job is run on  the  number  of  rows
                specified in the Size parameter.

          Size -> (long)
              The  Size  parameter  is  only  required  when  the mode is CUS-
              TOM_ROWS. The profile job is run  on  the  specified  number  of

            "Size": long
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
