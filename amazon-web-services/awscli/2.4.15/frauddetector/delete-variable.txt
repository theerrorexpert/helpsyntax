DELETE-VARIABLE()                                            DELETE-VARIABLE()



NAME
       delete-variable -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a variable.

       You can't delete variables that are included in an event type in Amazon
       Fraud Detector.

       Amazon Fraud Detector automatically deletes model output variables  and
       SageMaker  model  output variables when you delete the model. You can't
       delete these variables manually.

       When you delete a variable, Amazon Fraud Detector  permanently  deletes
       that  variable  and the data is no longer stored in Amazon Fraud Detec-
       tor.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-variable
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the variable to delete.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
