GET-OUTCOMES()                                                  GET-OUTCOMES()



NAME
       get-outcomes -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  one  or  more outcomes. This is a paginated API. If you provide a
       null maxResults , this actions retrieves a maximum of 100  records  per
       page.  If  you  provide a maxResults , the value must be between 50 and
       100. To get the next page results, provide the  pagination  token  from
       the  GetOutcomesResult as part of your request. A null pagination token
       fetches the records from the beginning.

SYNOPSIS
            get-outcomes
          [--name <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the outcome or outcomes to get.

       --next-token (string)
          The next page token for the request.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of objects to return for the request.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
