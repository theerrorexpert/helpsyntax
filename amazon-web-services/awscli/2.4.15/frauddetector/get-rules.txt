GET-RULES()                                                        GET-RULES()



NAME
       get-rules -

DESCRIPTION
       Get  all rules for a detector (paginated) if ruleId and ruleVersion are
       not specified. Gets all rules  for  the  detector  and  the  ruleId  if
       present  (paginated).  Gets  a specific rule if both the ruleId and the
       ruleVersion are specified.

       This is a paginated API. Providing null maxResults results in  retriev-
       ing  maximum  of  100  records  per page. If you provide maxResults the
       value must be between 50 and 100. To get the next page result,  a  pro-
       vide  a  pagination  token from GetRulesResult as part of your request.
       Null pagination token fetches the records from the beginning.

SYNOPSIS
            get-rules
          [--rule-id <value>]
          --detector-id <value>
          [--rule-version <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rule-id (string)
          The rule ID.

       --detector-id (string)
          The detector ID.

       --rule-version (string)
          The rule version.

       --next-token (string)
          The next page token.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of rules to return for the request.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
