SYNOPSIS
            get-event-prediction-metadata
          --event-id <value>
          --event-type-name <value>
          --detector-id <value>
          --detector-version-id <value>
          --prediction-timestamp <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --event-id (string)
          The event ID.

       --event-type-name (string)
          The  event  type associated with the detector specified for the pre-
          diction.

       --detector-id (string)
          The detector ID.

       --detector-version-id (string)
          The detector version ID.

       --prediction-timestamp (string)
          The timestamp that defines when the prediction was generated.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
