LIST-EVENT-PREDICTIONS()                              LIST-EVENT-PREDICTIONS()



NAME
       list-event-predictions -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a  list of past predictions. The list can be filtered by detector
       ID, detector version ID, event ID, event type, or by specifying a  time
       period.  If  filter  is  not  specified,  the most recent prediction is
       returned.

       For example, the following filter lists all past  predictions  for  xyz
       event type - { "eventType":{ "value": "xyz" } }

       This is a paginated API. If you provide a null maxResults , this action
       will retrieve a maximum of 10 records per page. If you provide a maxRe-
       sults  ,  the  value  must  be between 50 and 100. To get the next page
       results, provide the nextToken  from  the  response  as  part  of  your
       request. A null nextToken fetches the records from the beginning.

OPTIONS
       --event-id (structure)
          The event ID.

          value -> (string)
              A  statement containing a resource property and a value to spec-
              ify filter condition.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          value=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "value": "string"
          }

       --event-type (structure)
          The event type associated with the detector.

          value -> (string)
              A statement containing a resource property and a value to  spec-
              ify filter condition.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          value=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "value": "string"
          }

       --detector-id (structure)
          The detector ID.

          value -> (string)
              A  statement containing a resource property and a value to spec-
              ify filter condition.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          value=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "value": "string"
          }

       --detector-version-id (structure)
          The detector version ID.

          value -> (string)
              A statement containing a resource property and a value to  spec-
              ify filter condition.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          value=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "value": "string"
          }

       --prediction-time-range (structure)
          The time period for when the predictions were generated.

          startTime -> (string)
              The  start time of the time period for when the predictions were
              generated.

          endTime -> (string)
              The end time of the time period for when  the  predictions  were
              generated.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          startTime=string,endTime=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "startTime": "string",
            "endTime": "string"
          }

       --next-token (string)
          Identifies the next page of results to return. Use the token to make
          the call again to retrieve the next page. Keep all  other  arguments
          unchanged. Each pagination token expires after 24 hours.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of predictions to return for the request.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              eventId -> (string)
                 The event ID.

              eventTypeName -> (string)
                 The event type.

              eventTimestamp -> (string)
                 The timestamp of the event.

              predictionTimestamp -> (string)
