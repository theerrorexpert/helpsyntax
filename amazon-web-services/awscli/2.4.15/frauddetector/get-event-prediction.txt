NAME
       get-event-prediction -

DESCRIPTION
       Evaluates  an  event against a detector version. If a version ID is not
       provided, the detectors (ACTIVE ) version is used.

OPTIONS
       --detector-id (string)
          The detector ID.

       --detector-version-id (string)
          The detector version ID.

       --event-id (string)
          The unique ID used to identify the event.

       --event-type-name (string)
          The event type associated with the detector specified for  the  pre-
          diction.

       --entities (list)
          The entity type (associated with the detector's event type) and spe-
          cific entity ID representing who performed the event. If  an  entity
          id is not available, use "UNKNOWN."

          (structure)
              The entity details.

              entityType -> (string)
                 The entity type.

              entityId -> (string)
                 The entity ID. If you do not know the entityId , you can pass
                 unknown , which is areserved string literal.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          entityType=string,entityId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "entityType": "string",
              "entityId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --event-timestamp (string)
          Timestamp that defines when the event under evaluation occurred. The
          timestamp must be specified using ISO 8601 standard in UTC.

       --event-variables (map)
          Names  of  the  event  type's  variables you defined in Amazon Fraud
          Detector to represent data elements and their  corresponding  values
          for the event you are sending for evaluation.

          WARNING:
              You must provide at least one eventVariable

          To  ensure  most accurate fraud prediction and to simplify your data
          preparation, Amazon Fraud Detector will replace  all  missing  vari-
          ables or values as follows:
              For Amazon Fraud Detector trained models:

          If  a null value is provided explicitly for a variable or if a vari-
          able is missing, model will replace the null value  or  the  missing
          variable  (no  variable  name in the eventVariables map) with calcu-
          lated default mean/medians for numeric variables  and  with  special
          values for categorical variables.
              For imported SageMaker models:

          If a null value is provided explicitly for a variable, the model and
          rules will use null as the value. If a variable is not provided  (no
          variable  name  in the eventVariables map), model and rules will use
          the default value that is provided for the variable.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --external-model-endpoint-data-blobs (map)
          The Amazon SageMaker model endpoint input data blobs.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              A pre-formed Amazon SageMaker model input  you  can  include  if
              your  detector  version  includes  an  imported Amazon SageMaker
              model endpoint with pass-through input configuration.

              byteBuffer -> (blob)
                 The byte buffer of the Amazon SageMaker model endpoint  input
                 data blob.

              contentType -> (string)
                 The content type of the Amazon SageMaker model endpoint input
                 data blob.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=byteBuffer=blob,contentType=string,KeyName2=byteBuffer=blob,contentType=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": {
                "byteBuffer": blob,
                "contentType": "string"
              }
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       modelScores -> (list)
          The model scores.  Amazon  Fraud  Detector  generates  model  scores
          between 0 and 1000, where 0 is low fraud risk and 1000 is high fraud
          risk. Model scores are directly related to the false  positive  rate
          (FPR).  For  example, a score of 600 corresponds to an estimated 10%
          false positive rate whereas a score of 900 corresponds to  an  esti-
          mated 2% false positive rate.
