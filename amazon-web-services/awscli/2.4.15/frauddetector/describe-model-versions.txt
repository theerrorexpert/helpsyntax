NAME
       describe-model-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  all of the model versions for the specified model type or for the
       specified model type and model ID. You can also get details for a  sin-
       gle, specified model version.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-model-versions
          [--model-id <value>]
          [--model-version-number <value>]
          [--model-type <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --model-id (string)
          The model ID.

       --model-version-number (string)
          The model version number.

       --model-type (string)
          The model type.

          Possible values:

          o ONLINE_FRAUD_INSIGHTS

          o TRANSACTION_FRAUD_INSIGHTS

       --next-token (string)
          The next token from the previous results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       modelVersionDetails -> (list)
          The model version details.

              The details of the model version.

              modelId -> (string)
                 The model ID.

              modelType -> (string)
                 The model type.

              modelVersionNumber -> (string)
                 The model version number.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the model version.

              trainingDataSource -> (string)
                 The model version training data source.

              trainingDataSchema -> (structure)
                 The training data schema.

                 modelVariables -> (list)
                     The training data schema variables.

                     (string)

                 labelSchema -> (structure)
                     The label schema.

                     labelMapper -> (map)
                        The  label  mapper maps the Amazon Fraud Detector sup-
                        ported model classification labels (FRAUD , LEGIT ) to
                        the  appropriate  event  type  labels. For example, if
                        "FRAUD " and "LEGIT " are Amazon Fraud  Detector  sup-
                        ported labels, this mapper could be: {"FRAUD" => ["0"]
                        , "LEGIT" => ["1"]} or {"FRAUD" => ["false"] , "LEGIT"
                        =>  ["true"]}  or  {"FRAUD"  =>  ["fraud",  "abuse"] ,
                        "LEGIT" => ["legit", "safe"]} . The value part of  the
                        mapper  is a list, because you may have multiple label
                        variants from your event  type  for  a  single  Amazon
                        Fraud Detector label.

                        all possible model score thresholds. A model  with  no
                        predictive  power has an AUC of 0.5, whereas a perfect

                               old of 500 means any model score 500  or  above
                               is labeled as fraud.
