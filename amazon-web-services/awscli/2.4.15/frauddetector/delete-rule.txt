DELETE-RULE()                                                    DELETE-RULE()



NAME
       delete-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the  rule. You cannot delete a rule if it is used by an ACTIVE
       or INACTIVE detector version.

       When you delete a rule, Amazon Fraud Detector permanently deletes  that
       rule and the data is no longer stored in Amazon Fraud Detector.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-rule
          --rule <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rule (structure)
          A rule.

          detectorId -> (string)
              The detector for which the rule is associated.

          ruleId -> (string)
              The rule ID.

          ruleVersion -> (string)
              The rule version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          detectorId=string,ruleId=string,ruleVersion=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "detectorId": "string",
            "ruleId": "string",
            "ruleVersion": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
