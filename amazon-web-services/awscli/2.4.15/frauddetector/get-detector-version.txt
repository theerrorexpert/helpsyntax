GET-DETECTOR-VERSION()                                  GET-DETECTOR-VERSION()



NAME
       get-detector-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a particular detector version.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-detector-version
          --detector-id <value>
          --detector-version-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --detector-id (string)
          The detector ID.

       --detector-version-id (string)
          The detector version ID.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       detectorId -> (string)
          The detector ID.

       detectorVersionId -> (string)
          The detector version ID.

       description -> (string)
          The detector version description.

       externalModelEndpoints -> (list)
          The  Amazon  SageMaker model endpoints included in the detector ver-
          sion.

          (string)

       modelVersions -> (list)
          The model versions included in the detector version.

          (structure)
              The model version.

              modelId -> (string)
                 The model ID.

              modelType -> (string)
                 The model type.

              modelVersionNumber -> (string)
                 The model version number.

              arn -> (string)
                 The model version ARN.

       rules -> (list)
          The rules included in the detector version.

          (structure)
              A rule.

              detectorId -> (string)
                 The detector for which the rule is associated.

              ruleId -> (string)
                 The rule ID.

              ruleVersion -> (string)
                 The rule version.

       status -> (string)
          The status of the detector version.

       lastUpdatedTime -> (string)
          The timestamp when the detector version was last updated.

       createdTime -> (string)
          The timestamp when the detector version was created.

       ruleExecutionMode -> (string)
          The execution mode of the rule in the dectector
              FIRST_MATCHED indicates that  Amazon  Fraud  Detector  evaluates
              rules sequentially, first to last, stopping at the first matched
              rule. Amazon Fraud dectector then provides the outcomes for that
              single rule.

              ALL_MATCHED  indicates  that Amazon Fraud Detector evaluates all
              rules and returns the outcomes for all matched  rules.  You  can
              define  and  edit  the  rule mode at the detector version level,
              when it is in draft status.

       arn -> (string)
          The detector version ARN.
