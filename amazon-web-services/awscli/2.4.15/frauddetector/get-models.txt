GET-MODELS()                                                      GET-MODELS()



NAME
       get-models -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  one  or  more models. Gets all models for the Amazon Web Services
       account if no model type and no model id provided. Gets all models  for
       the  Amazon  Web  Services account and model type, if the model type is
       specified but model id is not provided. Gets a specific model if (model
       type, model id) tuple is specified.

       This is a paginated API. If you provide a null maxResults , this action
       retrieves a maximum of 10 records per page. If you provide a maxResults
       ,  the  value  must  be between 1 and 10. To get the next page results,
       provide the pagination token from the response as part of your request.
       A null pagination token fetches the records from the beginning.

SYNOPSIS
            get-models
          [--model-id <value>]
          [--model-type <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --model-id (string)
          The model ID.

       --model-type (string)
          The model type.

          Possible values:

          o ONLINE_FRAUD_INSIGHTS

          o TRANSACTION_FRAUD_INSIGHTS

       --next-token (string)
          The next token for the subsequent request.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of objects to return for the request.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
