GET-BATCH-PREDICTION-JOBS()                        GET-BATCH-PREDICTION-JOBS()



NAME
       get-batch-prediction-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  all  batch prediction jobs or a specific job if you specify a job
       ID. This is a paginated API. If you provide  a  null  maxResults,  this
       action  retrieves  a  maximum  of 50 records per page. If you provide a
       maxResults, the value must be between 1 and 50. To get  the  next  page
       results,  provide  the pagination token from the GetBatchPredictionJob-
       sResponse as part of your request. A null pagination token fetches  the
       records from the beginning.

SYNOPSIS
            get-batch-prediction-jobs
          [--job-id <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The batch prediction job for which to get the details.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of objects to return for the request.

       --next-token (string)
          The next token from the previous request.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
