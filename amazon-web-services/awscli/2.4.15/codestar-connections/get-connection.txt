GET-CONNECTION()                                              GET-CONNECTION()



NAME
       get-connection -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  connection  ARN  and  details  such as status, owner, and
       provider type.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-connection
          --connection-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --connection-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a connection.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about a connection

       The following get-connection example shows details about a  connection.

          aws codestar-connections get-connection \
              --connection-arn arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-east-1:123456789012:connection/aEXAMPLE-8aad-4d5d-8878-dfcab0bc441f

       Output:

          {
              "Connection": {
                  "ConnectionName": "MyConnection",
                  "ConnectionArn": "arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-east-1:123456789012:connection/aEXAMPLE-8aad-4d5d-8878-dfcab0bc441f",
                  "ProviderType": "Bitbucket",
                  "OwnerAccountId": "123456789012",
                  "ConnectionStatus": "AVAILABLE"
              }
          }

       For  more  information,  see  View  connection details in the Developer
       Tools console User Guide.

OUTPUT
       Connection -> (structure)
          The connection details, such as status, owner, and provider type.

          ConnectionName -> (string)
              The name of the connection. Connection names must be  unique  in
              an AWS user account.

          ConnectionArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the connection. The ARN is
              used as the connection reference when the connection  is  shared
              between AWS services.

              NOTE:
                 The ARN is never reused if the connection is deleted.

          ProviderType -> (string)
              The  name  of  the external provider where your third-party code
              repository is configured.

          OwnerAccountId -> (string)
              The identifier of the external provider where  your  third-party
              code  repository  is  configured.  For  Bitbucket,  this  is the
              account ID of the owner of the Bitbucket repository.

          ConnectionStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the connection.

          HostArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the host associated  with  the
              connection.
