CREATE-HOST()                                                    CREATE-HOST()



NAME
       create-host -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates   a   resource  that  represents  the  infrastructure  where  a
       third-party provider is installed. The host is  used  when  you  create
       connections  to  an installed third-party provider type, such as GitHub
       Enterprise Server. You create one host  for  all  connections  to  that
       provider.

       NOTE:
          A  host  created  through the CLI or the SDK is in PENDING status by
          default. You can make its status AVAILABLE by setting up the host in
          the console.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-host
          --name <value>
          --provider-type <value>
          --provider-endpoint <value>
          [--vpc-configuration <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The  name  of the host to be created. The name must be unique in the
          calling AWS account.

       --provider-type (string)
          The name of the installed provider to be associated with  your  con-
          nection.  The host resource represents the infrastructure where your
          provider type is installed. The valid provider type is GitHub Enter-
          prise Server.

          Possible values:

          o Bitbucket

          o GitHub

          o GitHubEnterpriseServer

       --provider-endpoint (string)
          The  endpoint  of  the  infrastructure to be represented by the host
          after it is created.

       --vpc-configuration (structure)
          The VPC configuration to be provisioned for the host. A VPC must  be
          configured and the infrastructure to be represented by the host must
          already be connected to the VPC.

          VpcId -> (string)
              The ID of the Amazon VPC connected to the  infrastructure  where
              your provider type is installed.

          SubnetIds -> (list)
              The  ID  of the subnet or subnets associated with the Amazon VPC
              connected to the infrastructure  where  your  provider  type  is
              installed.

              (string)

          SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
              The  ID of the security group or security groups associated with
              the Amazon  VPC  connected  to  the  infrastructure  where  your
              provider type is installed.

              (string)

          TlsCertificate -> (string)
              The  value  of  the  Transport  Layer Security (TLS) certificate
              associated with the infrastructure where your provider  type  is
              installed.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          VpcId=string,SubnetIds=string,string,SecurityGroupIds=string,string,TlsCertificate=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "VpcId": "string",
            "SubnetIds": ["string", ...],
            "SecurityGroupIds": ["string", ...],
            "TlsCertificate": "string"
          }

       --tags (list) (structure)
          A tag is a key-value pair that is used to manage the resource.

          This tag is available for use by AWS services that support tags.

          Key -> (string)
              The tag's key.

          Value -> (string)
              The tag's value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a host

       The following create-host example shows how to create a host  to repre-
       sent  the  endpoint  for  the  infrastructure  where  your  third-party
       provider   is   installed.  This  example  creates  a  host  where  the
       third-party installed provider is GitHub Enterprise Server.

       A host created through the AWS CLI is in  Pending  status  by  default.
       After you create a host with the CLI, use the console or the CLI to set
       up the host to make its status Available.

          aws codestar-connections create-host \
              --name MyHost \
              --provider-type GitHubEnterpriseServer \
              --provider-endpoint "https://my-instance.dev"

       Output:

          {
              "HostArn": "arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-east-1:123456789012:host/My-Host-28aef605"
          }

       For more information, see Create a host (CLI) in  the  Developer  Tools
       console User Guide.

OUTPUT
       HostArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the host to be created.

       Tags -> (list)
          (structure)
              A tag is a key-value pair that is used to manage the resource.

              This tag is available for use by AWS services that support tags.

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag's key.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag's value.
