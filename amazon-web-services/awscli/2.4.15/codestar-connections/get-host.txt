GET-HOST()                                                          GET-HOST()



NAME
       get-host -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  host  ARN and details such as status, provider type, end-
       point, and, if applicable, the VPC configuration.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-host
          --host-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --host-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the requested host.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about a host

       The following get-host example shows details about a host:

          aws codestar-connections get-host \
              --host-arn arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-east-1:123456789012:host/MyHost-28aef605

       Output:

          {
              "Name": "MyHost",
              "Status": "AVAILABLE",
              "ProviderType": "GitHubEnterpriseServer",
              "ProviderEndpoint": "https://test-instance-1.dev/"
          }
