CREATE-CONNECTION()                                        CREATE-CONNECTION()



NAME
       create-connection -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a connection that can then be given to other AWS services like
       CodePipeline so that it can access third-party code  repositories.  The
       connection  is in pending status until the third-party connection hand-
       shake is completed from the console.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-connection
          [--provider-type <value>]
          --connection-name <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--host-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --provider-type (string)
          The name of the external provider where your third-party code repos-
          itory is configured.

          Possible values:

          o Bitbucket

          o GitHub

          o GitHubEnterpriseServer

       --connection-name (string)
          The name of the connection to be created. The name must be unique in
          the calling AWS account.

       --tags (list)
          The key-value pair to use when tagging the resource.

          (structure)
              A tag is a key-value pair that is used to manage the resource.

              This tag is available for use by AWS services that support tags.

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag's key.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag's value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --host-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the host associated with the con-
          nection to be created.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a connection

       The following create-connection example shows how to create  a  connec-
       tion  to  a  third-party  repository. This example creates a connection
       where the third-party provider is Bitbucket.

       A connection created through the AWS CLI or AWS  CloudFormation  is  in
       Pending  status  by default. After you create a connection with the CLI
       or AWS CloudFormation, use the console to edit the connection  to  make
       its status Available.

          aws codestar-connections create-connection \
              --provider-type Bitbucket \
              --connection-name MyConnection

       Output:

          {
              "ConnectionArn": "arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-east-1:123456789012:connection/aEXAMPLE-8aad-4d5d-8878-dfcab0bc441f"
          }

       For  more  information,  see Create a connection in the Developer Tools
       console User Guide.

OUTPUT
       ConnectionArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the connection to be created.  The
          ARN  is  used  as  the  connection  reference when the connection is
          shared between AWS services.

          NOTE:
              The ARN is never reused if the connection is deleted.

       Tags -> (list)
          Specifies the tags applied to the resource.

          (structure)
              A tag is a key-value pair that is used to manage the resource.

              This tag is available for use by AWS services that support tags.

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag's key.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag's value.
