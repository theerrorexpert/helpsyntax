NAME
       describe-scheduled-actions -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the Application Auto Scaling scheduled actions for the speci-
       fied service namespace.

       You can filter the results using the ResourceId ,  ScalableDimension  ,
       and ScheduledActionNames parameters.

       For  more  information,  see  Scheduled  scaling and Managing scheduled
       scaling in the Application Auto Scaling User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-scheduled-actions is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: ScheduledActions

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ScheduledActions -> (list)
          Information about the scheduled actions.

          (structure)
              Represents a scheduled action.

              ScheduledActionName -> (string)
                 The name of the scheduled action.

              ScheduledActionARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the scheduled action.

              ServiceNamespace -> (string)
                 The namespace of the Amazon Web Services  service  that  pro-
                 vides the resource, or a custom-resource .

              Schedule -> (string)
                 The  schedule for this action. The following formats are sup-
                 ported:

                 o At expressions - "at(*yyyy* -*mm* -*dd* T*hh* :*mm* :*ss* )
                   "

                 o Rate expressions - "rate(*value*  *unit* ) "

                 o Cron expressions - "cron(*fields* ) "

                 At  expressions  are  useful  for  one-time  schedules.  Cron
                 expressions are useful for scheduled actions that run period-
                 ically at a specified date and time, and rate expressions are
                 useful for scheduled actions that run at a regular  interval.

                 At  and cron expressions use Universal Coordinated Time (UTC)
                 by default.

                 The cron format consists of six  fields  separated  by  white
                 spaces:     [Minutes]    [Hours]    [Day_of_Month]    [Month]
                 [Day_of_Week] [Year].

                 For rate expressions, value is a positive integer and unit is
                 minute | minutes | hour | hours | day | days .

                 For  more  information  and  examples,  see Example scheduled
                 actions for Application Auto Scaling in the Application  Auto
                 Scaling User Guide .

                 scheduled action, when the scheduled action  uses  an  at  or
                 cron expression.

                 The  identifier  of  the resource associated with the scaling
                 policy. This string consists of the resource type and  unique

                 o ECS  service  - The resource type is service and the unique
                   identifier is the cluster name and service  name.  Example:

                   This parameter must specify the OutputValue from the Cloud-

              StartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and time that the action is scheduled to begin, in
                 UTC.

              EndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the action is  scheduled  to  end,  in
                 UTC.

              ScalableTargetAction -> (structure)
                 The new minimum and maximum capacity. You can set both values
                 or just one. At the scheduled time, if the  current  capacity
                 is  below  the  minimum  capacity,  Application  Auto Scaling
                 scales out to the minimum capacity. If the  current  capacity
                 is  above  the  maximum  capacity,  Application  Auto Scaling
                 scales in to the maximum capacity.

                 MinCapacity -> (integer)
                     The minimum capacity.

                     For certain resources, the minimum value  allowed  is  0.
                     This includes Lambda provisioned concurrency, Spot Fleet,
                     ECS services, Aurora DB clusters, EMR clusters, and  cus-
                     tom resources. For all other resources, the minimum value
                     allowed is 1.

                 MaxCapacity -> (integer)
                     The maximum capacity.

                     Although you can specify a large maximum  capacity,  note
                     that service quotas may impose lower limits. Each service
                     has its own default quotas for the  maximum  capacity  of
                     the  resource. If you want to specify a higher limit, you
                     can request an increase. For  more  information,  consult
                     the documentation for that service. For information about
                     the default quotas for each  service,  see  Service  End-
                     points and Quotas in the Amazon Web Services General Ref-
                     erence .

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the scheduled action was created.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token required to get the next set of  results.  This  value  is
          null if there are no more results to return.
