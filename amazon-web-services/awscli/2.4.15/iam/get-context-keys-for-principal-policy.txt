NAME
       get-context-keys-for-principal-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a list of all of the context keys referenced in all the IAM poli-
       cies that are attached to the specified IAM entity. The entity  can  be
       an  IAM  user,  group, or role. If you specify a user, then the request
       also includes all of the policies attached to groups that the user is a
       member of.

       You  can  optionally include a list of one or more additional policies,
       specified as strings. If you want to include only a list of policies by
       string, use  GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy instead.
          Note:  This  operation  discloses  information about the permissions
          granted to other users. If you do not want users to see other user's
          permissions,  then consider allowing them to use  GetContextKeysFor-
          CustomPolicy instead.

       Context keys are variables maintained by Amazon Web  Services  and  its
       services  that  provide  details  about  the  context  of  an API query
       request. Context keys can be evaluated by testing against a value in an
       IAM  policy.  Use   GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy to understand what
       key names and values you must supply  when  you  call   SimulatePrinci-
       palPolicy .

SYNOPSIS
            get-context-keys-for-principal-policy
          --policy-source-arn <value>
          [--policy-input-list <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --policy-source-arn (string)
          The ARN of a user, group, or role whose policies contain the context
          keys that you want listed. If you specify a user, the list  includes
          context keys that are found in all policies that are attached to the
          user. The list also includes all groups that the user  is  a  member
          of.  If you pick a group or a role, then it includes only those con-
          text keys that are found in policies attached to that  entity.  Note
          that  all  parameters  are shown in unencoded form here for clarity,
          but must be URL encoded to be included as a  part  of  a  real  HTML
          request.

          For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in
          the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

       --policy-input-list (list)
          An optional list of additional policies for which you want the  list
          of context keys that are referenced.

          The  regex  pattern  used  to validate this parameter is a string of
          characters consisting of the following:

          o Any printable ASCII character ranging  from  the  space  character
            (\u0020 ) through the end of the ASCII character range

          o The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement
            character set (through \u00FF )

          o The special characters tab (\u0009 ), line  feed  (\u000A  ),  and
            carriage return (\u000D )

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To  list the context keys referenced by all policies associated with an
       IAM principal

       The following get-context-keys-for-principal-policy  command  retrieves
       all policies that are attached to the user saanvi and any groups she is
       a member of. It then parses each and lists the  context  keys  used  by
       those  policies.  Use this command to identify which context key values
       you must supply to successfully use the simulate-custom-policy and sim-
       ulate-principal-policy commands. You can also retrieve the list of con-
       text keys used by an  arbitrary  JSON  policy  by  using  the  get-con-
       text-keys-for-custom-policy command.

          aws iam get-context-keys-for-principal-policy \
             --policy-source-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/saanvi

       Output:

          {
              "ContextKeyNames": [
                  "aws:username",
                  "aws:CurrentTime"
              ]
          }

       For  more  information, see Using the IAM Policy Simulator (AWS CLI and
       AWS API) in the Using IAM guide.

OUTPUT
       ContextKeyNames -> (list)
          The list of context keys that are referenced in the input  policies.
