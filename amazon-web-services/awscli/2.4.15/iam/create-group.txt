CREATE-GROUP()                                                  CREATE-GROUP()



NAME
       create-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new group.

       For  information about the number of groups you can create, see IAM and
       STS quotas in the IAM User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-group
          [--path <value>]
          --group-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --path (string)
          The path to the group. For more information  about  paths,  see  IAM
          identifiers in the IAM User Guide .

          This  parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a
          slash (/).

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  either  a  forward  slash (/) by itself or a
          string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it
          can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021 ) through the DEL
          character (\u007F ), including most punctuation characters,  digits,
          and upper and lowercased letters.

       --group-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  group to create. Do not include the path in this
          value.

          IAM user, group, role, and policy names must be  unique  within  the
          account.  Names are not distinguished by case. For example, you can-
          not create resources named both "MyResource" and "myresource".

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create an IAM group

       The following create-group command creates an IAM group named Admins:

          aws iam create-group --group-name Admins

       Output:

          {
              "Group": {
                  "Path": "/",
                  "CreateDate": "2015-03-09T20:30:24.940Z",
                  "GroupId": "AIDGPMS9RO4H3FEXAMPLE",
                  "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:group/Admins",
                  "GroupName": "Admins"
              }
          }
