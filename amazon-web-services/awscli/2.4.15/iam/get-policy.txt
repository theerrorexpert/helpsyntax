GET-POLICY()                                                      GET-POLICY()



NAME
       get-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information about the specified managed policy, including the
       policy's default version and the total number of IAM users, groups, and
       roles to which the policy is attached. To retrieve the list of the spe-
       cific users, groups, and roles that the  policy  is  attached  to,  use
       ListEntitiesForPolicy  . This operation returns metadata about the pol-
       icy. To retrieve the actual policy document for a specific  version  of
       the policy, use  GetPolicyVersion .

       This   operation  retrieves  information  about  managed  policies.  To
       retrieve information about an inline policy that is  embedded  with  an
       IAM  user,  group,  or  role, use  GetUserPolicy ,  GetGroupPolicy , or
       GetRolePolicy .

       For more information about policies, see Managed  policies  and  inline
       policies in the IAM User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-policy
          --policy-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --policy-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the managed policy that you want
          information about.

          For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in
          the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve information about the specified managed policy

       This  example  returns  details  about  the managed policy whose ARN is
       arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/MySamplePolicy:

          aws iam get-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/MySamplePolicy

       Output:

OUTPUT
       Policy -> (structure)
          A structure containing details about the policy.

          PolicyName -> (string)
              The friendly name (not ARN) identifying the policy.

          PolicyId -> (string)
              The stable and unique string identifying the policy.

              For  more  information about IDs, see IAM identifiers in the IAM
              User Guide .

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN). ARNs are unique identifiers  for
              Amazon Web Services resources.

              For  more  information  about  ARNs, go to Amazon Resource Names
              (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

          Path -> (string)
              The path to the policy.

              For more information about paths, see IAM identifiers in the IAM
              User Guide .

          DefaultVersionId -> (string)
              The  identifier for the version of the policy that is set as the
              default version.

          AttachmentCount -> (integer)
              The number of entities (users, groups, and roles) that the  pol-
              icy is attached to.

          PermissionsBoundaryUsageCount -> (integer)
              The number of entities (users and roles) for which the policy is
              used to set the permissions boundary.

              For  more  information   about   permissions   boundaries,   see
              Permissions  boundaries for IAM identities in the IAM User Guide
              .

          IsAttachable -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether the policy can be attached  to  an  IAM  user,
              group, or role.

          Description -> (string)
              A friendly description of the policy.

              This element is included in the response to the  GetPolicy oper-
              ation. It is not included in the response to  the   ListPolicies
              operation.

          CreateDate -> (timestamp)
              The  date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format , when the pol-
              icy was created.

          UpdateDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format , when the  pol-
              icy was last updated.

              When a policy has only one version, this field contains the date
              and time when the policy was created. When  a  policy  has  more
              than one version, this field contains the date and time when the
              most recent policy version was created.

          Tags -> (list)
              A list of tags that are attached to the  instance  profile.  For
              more information about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in the
              IAM User Guide .

              (structure)
                 A structure that represents user-provided metadata  that  can
                 be  associated  with  an  IAM  resource. For more information
                 about tagging, see Tagging IAM  resources  in  the  IAM  User
                 Guide .

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the
                     associated value. For example, Department or Cost  Center
                     are common choices.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  value  associated  with  this tag. For example, tags
                     with a key name of Department could have values  such  as
                     Human  Resources , Accounting , and Support . Tags with a
                     key name of Cost Center might have values that consist of
                     the  number associated with the different cost centers in
                     your company. Typically, many resources  have  tags  with
                     the same key name but with different values.

                     NOTE:
                        Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag Value as
                        a single string. If you need to store  an  array,  you
                        can  store  comma-separated values in the string. How-
                        ever, you must interpret the value in your code.
