DELETE-ROLE()                                                    DELETE-ROLE()



NAME
       delete-role -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the  specified  role.  The  role  must  not  have any policies
       attached. For more information about roles, see Working with roles .

       WARNING:
          Make sure that you do not have any Amazon EC2 instances running with
          the  role  you are about to delete. Deleting a role or instance pro-
          file that is associated with  a  running  instance  will  break  any
          applications running on the instance.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-role
          --role-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --role-name (string)
          The name of the role to delete.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters consisting of upper  and  lowercase  alphanumeric  characters
          with  no  spaces.  You can also include any of the following charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete an IAM role

       The following delete-role command removes the role named Test-Role:

          aws iam delete-role --role-name Test-Role

       Before you can delete a  role,  you  must  remove  the  role  from  any
       instance  profile  (remove-role-from-instance-profile), detach any man-
       aged policies (detach-role-policy) and delete any inline policies  that
       are attached to the role (delete-role-policy).

       For  more information, see Creating a Role and Instance Profiles in the
       Using IAM guide.

OUTPUT
       None
