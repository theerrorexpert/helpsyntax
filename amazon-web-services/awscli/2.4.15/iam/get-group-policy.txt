GET-GROUP-POLICY()                                          GET-GROUP-POLICY()



NAME
       get-group-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the specified inline policy document that is embedded in the
       specified IAM group.

       NOTE:
          Policies returned by this operation are URL-encoded  compliant  with
          RFC  3986  . You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy
          back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you  can  use
          the  decode  method  of the java.net.URLDecoder utility class in the
          Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality.

       An IAM group can also have managed policies attached to it. To retrieve
       a  managed  policy document that is attached to a group, use  GetPolicy
       to determine the policy's default version, then  use   GetPolicyVersion
       to retrieve the policy document.

       For  more  information  about policies, see Managed policies and inline
       policies in the IAM User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            get-group-policy
          --group-name <value>
          --policy-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --group-name (string)
          The name of the group the policy is associated with.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  upper  and lowercase alphanumeric characters
          with no spaces. You can also include any of  the  following  charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --policy-name (string)
          The name of the policy document to get.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about a policy attached to an IAM group

       The following get-group-policy command gets information about the spec-
       ified policy attached to the group named Test-Group:

          aws iam get-group-policy --group-name Test-Group --policy-name S3-ReadOnly-Policy

       Output:

          {
              "GroupName": "Test-Group",
              "PolicyDocument": {
                  "Statement": [
                      {
                          "Action": [
                              "s3:Get*",
                              "s3:List*"
                          ],
                          "Resource": "*",
                          "Effect": "Allow"
                      }
                  ]
              },
              "PolicyName": "S3-ReadOnly-Policy"
          }

       For more information, see Managing IAM Policies in the Using IAM guide.

OUTPUT
       GroupName -> (string)
          The group the policy is associated with.

       PolicyName -> (string)
          The name of the policy.

       PolicyDocument -> (string)
          The policy document.

          IAM stores policies in JSON format.  However,  resources  that  were
          created  using  CloudFormation  templates  can be formatted in YAML.
          CloudFormation always converts a YAML policy to JSON  format  before
          submitting it to IAM.
