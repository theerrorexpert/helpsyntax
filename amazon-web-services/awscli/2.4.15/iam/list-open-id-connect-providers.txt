LIST-OPEN-ID-CONNECT-PROVIDERS()              LIST-OPEN-ID-CONNECT-PROVIDERS()



NAME
       list-open-id-connect-providers -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists information about the IAM OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider resource
       objects defined in the Amazon Web Services account.

       NOTE:
          IAM resource-listing operations return a  subset  of  the  available
          attributes  for  the  resource. For example, this operation does not
          return tags, even though they  are  an  attribute  of  the  returned
          object.  To  view  all  of the information for an OIDC provider, see
          GetOpenIDConnectProvider .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-open-id-connect-providers
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list information about the  OpenID  Connect  providers  in  the  AWS
       account

       This example returns a list of ARNS of all the OpenID Connect providers
       that are defined in the current AWS account:

          aws iam list-open-id-connect-providers

       Output:

          {
            "OpenIDConnectProviderList": [
              {
                "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:oidc-provider/example.oidcprovider.com"
              }
            ]
          }

       the Using IAM guide.

OUTPUT
       OpenIDConnectProviderList -> (list)
          The list of IAM OIDC provider resource objects defined in the Amazon
          Web Services account.

          (structure)
              Contains the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for an IAM  OpenID  Con-
              nect provider.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN). ARNs are unique identifiers
                 for Amazon Web Services resources.

                 For more information about ARNs, go to Amazon Resource  Names
                 (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference .
