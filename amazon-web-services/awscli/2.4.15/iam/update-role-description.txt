UPDATE-ROLE-DESCRIPTION()                            UPDATE-ROLE-DESCRIPTION()



NAME
       update-role-description -

DESCRIPTION
       Use  UpdateRole instead.

       Modifies  only  the  description of a role. This operation performs the
       same function as the Description parameter in the UpdateRole operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-role-description
          --role-name <value>
          --description <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --role-name (string)
          The name of the role that you want to modify.

       --description (string)
          The new description that you want to apply to the specified role.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To change an IAM role's description

       The  following  update-role  command changes the description of the IAM
       role production-role to Main production role.

          aws iam update-role-description --role-name production-role --description 'Main production role'

          Output::

          {

              specify the duration  using  the  optional  DurationSeconds  API
              parameter or duration-seconds CLI parameter.

          PermissionsBoundary -> (structure)
              The  ARN  of the policy used to set the permissions boundary for
              the role.

              For  more  information   about   permissions   boundaries,   see

                 for the user or role.

          Tags -> (list)
              A  list of tags that are attached to the role. For more informa-
              tion about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in  the  IAM  User
              Guide .

              (structure)
                 A  structure  that represents user-provided metadata that can
                 be associated with an  IAM  resource.  For  more  information
                 about  tagging,  see  Tagging  IAM  resources in the IAM User
                 Guide .

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve  the
                     associated  value. For example, Department or Cost Center
                     are common choices.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value associated with this  tag.  For  example,  tags
                     with  a  key name of Department could have values such as
                     Human Resources , Accounting , and Support . Tags with  a
                     key name of Cost Center might have values that consist of
                     the number associated with the different cost centers  in
                     your  company.  Typically,  many resources have tags with
                     the same key name but with different values.

                     NOTE:
                        Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag Value as
                        a  single  string.  If you need to store an array, you
                        can store comma-separated values in the  string.  How-
                        ever, you must interpret the value in your code.

          RoleLastUsed -> (structure)
              Contains  information  about  the last time that an IAM role was
              used. This includes the date and time and the  Region  in  which
              the role was last used. Activity is only reported for the trail-
              ing 400 days. This period can be shorter if  your  Region  began
              supporting  these  features within the last year. The role might
              have been used more than 400 days ago. For more information, see
              Regions where data is tracked in the IAM User Guide .

              LastUsedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format that the role
                 was last used.

                 This field is null if the role has not been used  within  the
                 IAM  tracking period. For more information about the tracking
                 period, see Regions where data is tracked  in  the  IAM  User
                 Guide .

              Region -> (string)
                 The  name of the Amazon Web Services Region in which the role
                 was last used.
