TAG-SERVER-CERTIFICATE()                              TAG-SERVER-CERTIFICATE()



NAME
       tag-server-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  one  or more tags to an IAM server certificate. If a tag with the
       same key name already exists, then that tag is overwritten with the new
       value.

       NOTE:
          For certificates in a Region supported by Certificate Manager (ACM),
          we recommend that you don't use IAM  server  certificates.  Instead,
          use  ACM  to provision, manage, and deploy your server certificates.
          For more information about IAM  server  certificates,  Working  with
          server certificates in the IAM User Guide .

       A tag consists of a key name and an associated value. By assigning tags
       to your resources, you can do the following:

       o Administrative grouping and discovery - Attach tags to  resources  to
         aid in organization and search. For example, you could search for all
         resources with the key name Project and the value  MyImportantProject
         .  Or  search for all resources with the key name Cost Center and the
         value 41200 .

       o Access control - Include tags in IAM  user-based  and  resource-based
         policies.  You  can use tags to restrict access to only a server cer-
         tificate that has a specified tag attached. For examples of  policies
         that show how to use tags to control access, see Control access using
         IAM tags in the IAM User Guide .

       o Cost allocation - Use tags to help track which individuals and  teams
         are using which Amazon Web Services resources.

       NOTE:

          o If  any  one  of  the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed
            maximum number of tags, then the  entire  request  fails  and  the
            resource  is  not created. For more information about tagging, see
            Tagging IAM resources in the IAM User Guide .

          o Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag Value  as  a  single
            string.  If  you need to store an array, you can store comma-sepa-
            rated values in the string. However, you must interpret the  value
            in your code.

SYNOPSIS
            tag-server-certificate
          --server-certificate-name <value>
          --tags <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --server-certificate-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  IAM  server certificate to which you want to add
          tags.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  upper  and lowercase alphanumeric characters
          with no spaces. You can also include any of  the  following  charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --tags (list)
          The  list of tags that you want to attach to the IAM server certifi-
          cate. Each tag consists of a key name and an associated value.

          (structure)
              A structure that represents user-provided metadata that  can  be
              associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tag-
              ging, see Tagging IAM resources in the IAM User Guide .

              Key -> (string)
                 The key name that can be used to  look  up  or  retrieve  the
                 associated  value. For example, Department or Cost Center are
                 common choices.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with  a
                 key  name  of  Department  could  have  values  such as Human
                 Resources , Accounting , and Support . Tags with a  key  name
                 of  Cost  Center might have values that consist of the number
                 associated with the different cost centers in  your  company.
                 Typically,  many  resources  have tags with the same key name
                 but with different values.

                 NOTE:
                     Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag Value as  a
                     single  string.  If  you  need to store an array, you can
                     store comma-separated values in the string. However,  you
                     must interpret the value in your code.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
