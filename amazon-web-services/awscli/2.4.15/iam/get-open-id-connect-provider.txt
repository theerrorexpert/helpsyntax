GET-OPEN-ID-CONNECT-PROVIDER()                  GET-OPEN-ID-CONNECT-PROVIDER()



NAME
       get-open-id-connect-provider -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about the specified OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider
       resource object in IAM.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-open-id-connect-provider
          --open-id-connect-provider-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --open-id-connect-provider-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the OIDC provider resource  object
          in  IAM  to get information for. You can get a list of OIDC provider
          resource ARNs by using the  ListOpenIDConnectProviders operation.

          For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in
          the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To return information about the specified OpenID Connect provider

       This  example  returns  details about the OpenID Connect provider whose
       ARN is arn:aws:iam::123456789012:oidc-provider/server.example.com:

          aws iam get-open-id-connect-provider --open-id-connect-provider-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:oidc-provider/server.example.com

       Output:

          {
              "Url": "server.example.com"
                  "CreateDate": "2015-06-16T19:41:48Z",
                  "ThumbprintList": [
                                "12345abcdefghijk67890lmnopqrst987example"
                          ],
                  "ClientIDList": [
                                "example-application-ID"
                          ]
          }

       For more information, see Using OpenID Connect  Identity  Providers  in
       the Using IAM guide.

OUTPUT
       Url -> (string)
          The  URL  that  the  IAM OIDC provider resource object is associated
          with. For more information, see  CreateOpenIDConnectProvider .

       ClientIDList -> (list)
          A list of client IDs (also known as audiences) that  are  associated
          with  the  specified  IAM  OIDC  provider  resource object. For more
          information, see  CreateOpenIDConnectProvider .

          (string)

       ThumbprintList -> (list)
          A list of certificate thumbprints that are associated with the spec-
          ified  IAM  OIDC provider resource object. For more information, see
          CreateOpenIDConnectProvider .

          (string)
              Contains a thumbprint for an identity provider's server certifi-
              cate.

              The  identity  provider's  server  certificate thumbprint is the
              hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of the self-signed  X.509  certifi-
              cate.  This  thumbprint  is  used by the domain where the OpenID
              Connect provider makes its keys  available.  The  thumbprint  is
              always a 40-character string.

       CreateDate -> (timestamp)
          The  date  and  time  when the IAM OIDC provider resource object was
          created in the Amazon Web Services account.

       Tags -> (list)
          A list of tags that are attached to the specified IAM OIDC provider.
          The returned list of tags is sorted by tag key. For more information
          about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in the IAM User Guide .

          (structure)
              A structure that represents user-provided metadata that  can  be
              associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tag-
              ging, see Tagging IAM resources in the IAM User Guide .

              Key -> (string)
                 The key name that can be used to  look  up  or  retrieve  the
                 associated  value. For example, Department or Cost Center are
                 common choices.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with  a
                 key  name  of  Department  could  have  values  such as Human
                 Resources , Accounting , and Support . Tags with a  key  name
                 of  Cost  Center might have values that consist of the number
                 associated with the different cost centers in  your  company.
                 Typically,  many  resources  have tags with the same key name
                 but with different values.

                 NOTE:
                     Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag Value as  a
                     single  string.  If  you  need to store an array, you can
                     store comma-separated values in the string. However,  you
                     must interpret the value in your code.
