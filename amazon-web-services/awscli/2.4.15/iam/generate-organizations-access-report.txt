NAME
       generate-organizations-access-report -

DESCRIPTION
       Generates  a  report  for service last accessed data for Organizations.
       You can generate a report for any entities (organization root,  organi-
       zational unit, or account) or policies in your organization.

       To  call this operation, you must be signed in using your Organizations
       management account credentials. You can use your long-term IAM user  or
       root  user  credentials,  or temporary credentials from assuming an IAM
       role. SCPs must be enabled for your organization root.  You  must  have
       the  required  IAM and Organizations permissions. For more information,
       see Refining permissions using service last accessed data  in  the  IAM
       User Guide .

       You  can  generate  a service last accessed data report for entities by
       specifying only the entity's path. This data includes a  list  of  ser-
       vices  that  are  allowed  by  any service control policies (SCPs) that
       apply to the entity.

       You can generate a service last accessed data report for  a  policy  by
       specifying  an  entity's  path and an optional Organizations policy ID.
       This data includes a list of services that are allowed by the specified
       SCP.

       For  each  service  in  both  report  types, the data includes the most
       recent account activity that the policy allows to account principals in
       the  entity  or  the entity's children. For important information about
       the data, reporting period, permissions required, troubleshooting,  and
       supported  Regions see Reducing permissions using service last accessed
       data in the IAM User Guide .

       WARNING:
          The data includes all attempts to access Amazon  Web  Services,  not
          just  the successful ones. This includes all attempts that were made
          using the Amazon Web Services Management  Console,  the  Amazon  Web
          Services  API  through  any  of the SDKs, or any of the command line
          tools. An unexpected entry in the service last  accessed  data  does
          not  mean  that an account has been compromised, because the request
          might have been denied. Refer to your CloudTrail logs as the author-
          itative  source for information about all API calls and whether they
          were successful or denied access. For more information, see  Logging
          IAM events with CloudTrail in the IAM User Guide .

       This operation returns a JobId . Use this parameter in the ``  GetOrga-
       nizationsAccessReport `` operation to check the status  of  the  report
       generation.  To check the status of this request, use the JobId parame-
       ter in the ``  GetOrganizationsAccessReport `` operation and  test  the
       JobStatus  response  parameter.  When  the  job  is  complete,  you can
       retrieve the report.

       To generate a service last accessed data report for  entities,  specify
       an entity path without specifying the optional Organizations policy ID.
       The type of entity that you specify determines the data returned in the
       report.

       o Root   When  you  specify  the  organizations root as the entity, the
         resulting report lists all of the services allowed by SCPs  that  are
         attached to your root. For each service, the report includes data for
         all accounts in your  organization  except  the  management  account,
         because the management account is not limited by SCPs.

       o OU   When  you specify an organizational unit (OU) as the entity, the
         resulting report lists all of the services allowed by SCPs  that  are
         attached  to  the  OU  and  its parents. For each service, the report
         includes data for all accounts in the OU or its children.  This  data
         excludes  the  management  account, because the management account is
         not limited by SCPs.

       o management account  When you  specify  the  management  account,  the
         resulting  report lists all Amazon Web Services services, because the
         management account is not limited by  SCPs.  For  each  service,  the
         report includes data for only the management account.

       o Account   When you specify another account as the entity, the result-
         ing report lists all  of  the  services  allowed  by  SCPs  that  are
         attached to the account and its parents. For each service, the report
         includes data for only the specified account.

       To generate a service last accessed data report for  policies,  specify
       an  entity  path  and the optional Organizations policy ID. The type of
       entity that you specify determines the data returned for each  service.

       o Root  When you specify the root entity and a policy ID, the resulting
         report lists all of the services that are allowed  by  the  specified
         SCP.  For  each service, the report includes data for all accounts in
         your organization to which the SCP applies. This  data  excludes  the
         management  account, because the management account is not limited by
         SCPs. If the SCP is not attached to any entities in the organization,
         then the report will return a list of services with no data.

       o OU   When  you  specify  an  OU entity and a policy ID, the resulting
         report lists all of the services that are allowed  by  the  specified
         SCP.  For  each service, the report includes data for all accounts in
         the OU or its children to which the  SCP  applies.  This  means  that
         other  accounts outside the OU that are affected by the SCP might not
         be included in the data. This data excludes the  management  account,
         because  the management account is not limited by SCPs. If the SCP is
         not attached to the OU or one of its children, the report will return
         a list of services with no data.

       o management  account   When  you  specify  the management account, the
         resulting report lists all Amazon Web Services services, because  the
         management account is not limited by SCPs. If you specify a policy ID
         in the CLI or API, the policy  is  ignored.  For  each  service,  the
         report includes data for only the management account.

       o Account  When you specify another account entity and a policy ID, the
         resulting report lists all of the services that are  allowed  by  the
         specified  SCP.  For  each service, the report includes data for only
         the specified account. This means that other accounts in the  organi-
         zation  that  are  affected  by  the SCP might not be included in the
         data. If the SCP is not attached to  the  account,  the  report  will
         return a list of services with no data.

       NOTE:
          Service  last  accessed  data  does  not use other policy types when
          determining whether a principal could access a service. These  other
          policy  types  include identity-based policies, resource-based poli-
          cies, access control lists,  IAM  permissions  boundaries,  and  STS
          assume  role policies. It only applies SCP logic. For more about the
          evaluation of policy types, see Evaluating policies in the IAM  User
          Guide .

       For  more  information  about  service last accessed data, see Reducing
       policy scope by viewing user activity in the IAM User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            generate-organizations-access-report
          --entity-path <value>
          [--organizations-policy-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --entity-path (string)
          The path of the Organizations entity (root, OU, or account). You can
          build an entity path using the known structure of your organization.
          For example, assume that your account ID  is  123456789012  and  its
          parent  OU  ID  is  ou-rge0-awsabcde  .  The organization root ID is
          r-f6g7h8i9j0example and your organization ID is o-a1b2c3d4e5 .  Your
          entity         path         is        o-a1b2c3d4e5/r-f6g7h8i9j0exam-
          ple/ou-rge0-awsabcde/123456789012 .

       --organizations-policy-id (string)
          The identifier of the Organizations service  control  policy  (SCP).
          This parameter is optional.

          This  ID is used to generate information about when an account prin-
          cipal that is limited by the SCP attempted to access an  Amazon  Web
          Services service.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To generate an access report for a root in an organization

       The  following  generate-organizations-access-report  example  starts a
