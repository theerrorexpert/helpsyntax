LIST-MFA-DEVICES()                                          LIST-MFA-DEVICES()



NAME
       list-mfa-devices -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  MFA  devices for an IAM user. If the request includes a IAM
       user name, then this operation lists all  the  MFA  devices  associated
       with  the specified user. If you do not specify a user name, IAM deter-
       mines the user name implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services  access
       key ID signing the request for this operation.

       You  can paginate the results using the MaxItems and Marker parameters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-mfa-devices is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: MFADevices

SYNOPSIS
            list-mfa-devices
          [--user-name <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-name (string)
          The name of the user whose MFA devices you want to list.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters consisting of upper  and  lowercase  alphanumeric  characters
          with  no  spaces.  You can also include any of the following charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list all MFA devices for a specified user

       This  example  returns details about the MFA device assigned to the IAM
       user Bob:

          aws iam list-mfa-devices --user-name Bob

       Output:

          {
            "MFADevices": [
              {
                "UserName": "Bob",
                "SerialNumber": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/BobsMFADevice",
                "EnableDate": "2015-06-16T22:36:37Z"
              }
            ]
          }

OUTPUT
       MFADevices -> (list)
          A list of MFA devices.

          (structure)
              Contains information about an MFA device.

              This  data type is used as a response element in the  ListMFADe-
              vices operation.

              UserName -> (string)
                 The user with whom the MFA device is associated.

              SerialNumber -> (string)
                 The serial number that uniquely identifies  the  MFA  device.
                 For virtual MFA devices, the serial number is the device ARN.

              EnableDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date when the MFA device was enabled for the user.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether there are more  items  to  return.  If
          your  results  were  truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination
          request using the Marker request parameter to retrieve  more  items.
          Note that IAM might return fewer than the MaxItems number of results
          even when there are more results available. We  recommend  that  you
          check  IsTruncated  after  every call to ensure that you receive all
          your results.

       Marker -> (string)
          When IsTruncated is true , this element is present and contains  the
          value  to  use  for  the Marker parameter in a subsequent pagination
          request.
