LIST-ENTITIES-FOR-POLICY()                          LIST-ENTITIES-FOR-POLICY()



NAME
       list-entities-for-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all IAM users, groups, and roles that the specified managed pol-
       icy is attached to.

       You can use the optional EntityFilter parameter to limit the results to
       a  particular type of entity (users, groups, or roles). For example, to
       list only the roles that are attached  to  the  specified  policy,  set
       EntityFilter to Role .

       You  can paginate the results using the MaxItems and Marker parameters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-entities-for-policy is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: PolicyGroups, PolicyUsers, PolicyRoles

SYNOPSIS
            list-entities-for-policy
          --policy-arn <value>
          [--entity-filter <value>]
          [--path-prefix <value>]
          [--policy-usage-filter <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --policy-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM policy for which you want
          the versions.

          For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in
          the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

       --entity-filter (string)
          The entity type to use for filtering the results.

          For  example,  when  EntityFilter  is Role , only the roles that are
          attached to the specified policy are  returned.  This  parameter  is
          optional.  If  it  is  not  included,  all attached entities (users,
          groups, and roles) are returned. The  argument  for  this  parameter
          must be one of the valid values listed below.

          Possible values:

          o User

          o Role

          o Group

          o LocalManagedPolicy

          o AWSManagedPolicy

       --path-prefix (string)
          The  path  prefix  for  filtering  the  results.  This  parameter is
          optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/), listing
          all entities.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters consisting of either a forward  slash  (/)  by  itself  or  a
          string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it
          can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021 ) through the DEL
          character  (\u007F ), including most punctuation characters, digits,
          and upper and lowercased letters.

       --policy-usage-filter (string)
          The policy usage method to use for filtering the results.

          To list only permissions policies, set PolicyUsageFilter to  Permis-
          sionsPolicy  .  To  list  only  the policies used to set permissions
          boundaries, set the value to PermissionsBoundary .

          This parameter is optional. If it is not included, all policies  are
          returned.

          Possible values:

          o PermissionsPolicy

          o PermissionsBoundary

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list all users, groups, and roles that the specified managed  policy
       is attached to

       This  example  returns  a list of IAM groups, roles, and users who have
       the policy arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/TestPolicy attached:

          aws iam list-entities-for-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/TestPolicy

       Output:

          {
            "PolicyGroups": [
              {
                "GroupName": "Admins"
              }
            ],
            "PolicyUsers": [
              {
                "UserName": "Bob"
              }
            ],
            "PolicyRoles": [
              {
                "RoleName": "testRole"
              }
            ],
            "IsTruncated": false
          }

          (structure)
              Contains  information  about  a  role  that  a managed policy is
              attached to.

              This data type is used as a response element in  the   ListEnti-
              tiesForPolicy operation.

              For  more  information  about managed policies, refer to Managed
              policies and inline policies in the IAM User Guide .

              RoleName -> (string)

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether there are more  items  to  return.  If
          your  results  were  truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination
          request using the Marker request parameter to retrieve  more  items.
          Note that IAM might return fewer than the MaxItems number of results
          even when there are more results available. We  recommend  that  you
          check  IsTruncated  after  every call to ensure that you receive all
          your results.

       Marker -> (string)
          When IsTruncated is true , this element is present and contains  the
          value  to  use  for  the Marker parameter in a subsequent pagination
          request.
