ATTACH-ROLE-POLICY()                                      ATTACH-ROLE-POLICY()



NAME
       attach-role-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Attaches  the  specified managed policy to the specified IAM role. When
       you attach a managed policy to a role, the managed policy becomes  part
       of the role's permission (access) policy.

       NOTE:
          You  cannot  use  a  managed  policy as the role's trust policy. The
          role's trust policy is created at the same time as the  role,  using
          CreateRole  .  You can update a role's trust policy using  UpdateAs-
          sumeRolePolicy .

       Use this operation to attach a managed policy to a role.  To  embed  an
       inline  policy  in  a  role,  use  PutRolePolicy . For more information
       about policies, see Managed policies and inline  policies  in  the  IAM
       User Guide .

       As  a best practice, you can validate your IAM policies. To learn more,
       see Validating IAM policies in the IAM User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            attach-role-policy
          --role-name <value>
          --policy-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --role-name (string)
          The name (friendly name, not ARN) of the role to attach  the  policy
          to.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters consisting of upper  and  lowercase  alphanumeric  characters
          with  no  spaces.  You can also include any of the following charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --policy-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM policy you want to attach.

          For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in
          the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To attach a managed policy to an IAM role

       The following attach-role-policy command attaches the AWS managed  pol-
       icy named ReadOnlyAccess to the IAM role named ReadOnlyRole:

          aws iam attach-role-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ReadOnlyAccess --role-name ReadOnlyRole

       For  more  information, see Managed Policies and Inline Policies in the
       Using IAM guide.

OUTPUT
       None
