LIST-POLICIES()                                                LIST-POLICIES()



NAME
       list-policies -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  the  managed policies that are available in your Amazon Web
       Services account, including your own customer-defined managed  policies
       and all Amazon Web Services managed policies.

       You can filter the list of policies that is returned using the optional
       OnlyAttached , Scope , and PathPrefix parameters. For example, to  list
       only the customer managed policies in your Amazon Web Services account,
       set Scope to Local . To list only Amazon Web Services managed policies,
       set Scope to AWS .

       You  can paginate the results using the MaxItems and Marker parameters.

       For more information about managed policies, see Managed  policies  and
       inline policies in the IAM User Guide .

       NOTE:
          IAM  resource-listing  operations  return  a subset of the available
          attributes for the resource. For example, this  operation  does  not
          return  tags,  even  though  they  are  an attribute of the returned
          object. To view all of the information for a customer manged policy,
          see  GetPolicy .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-policies  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Policies

SYNOPSIS
            list-policies
          [--scope <value>]
          [--only-attached | --no-only-attached]
          [--path-prefix <value>]
          [--policy-usage-filter <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --scope (string)
          The scope to use for filtering the results.

          To list only Amazon Web Services managed policies, set Scope to  AWS
          . To list only the customer managed policies in your Amazon Web Ser-
          vices account, set Scope to Local .

          This parameter is optional. If it is not included, or if it  is  set
          to All , all policies are returned.

          Possible values:

          o All

          o AWS

          o Local

       --only-attached | --no-only-attached (boolean)
          A flag to filter the results to only the attached policies.

          When  OnlyAttached  is  true  ,  the returned list contains only the
          policies that are attached to an IAM  user,  group,  or  role.  When
          OnlyAttached  is  false , or when the parameter is not included, all
          policies are returned.

       --path-prefix (string)
          The path  prefix  for  filtering  the  results.  This  parameter  is
          optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/), listing
          all policies. This parameter allows (through its regex pattern  )  a
          string  of  characters  consisting  of either a forward slash (/) by
          itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes.  In
          addition,  it  can  contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021 )
          through the DEL character  (\u007F  ),  including  most  punctuation
          characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.

       --policy-usage-filter (string)
          The policy usage method to use for filtering the results.

          To  list only permissions policies, set PolicyUsageFilter to Permis-
          sionsPolicy . To list only the  policies  used  to  set  permissions
          boundaries, set the value to PermissionsBoundary .

          This  parameter is optional. If it is not included, all policies are
          returned.

          Possible values:

          o PermissionsPolicy

          o PermissionsBoundary

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a managed policy.

              This  data type is used as a response element in the  CreatePol-
              icy ,  GetPolicy , and  ListPolicies operations.

              For more information about managed policies,  refer  to  Managed
              policies and inline policies in the IAM User Guide .

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN). ARNs are  unique  identifiers
                 for Amazon Web Services resources.

                 For  more information about ARNs, go to Amazon Resource Names
                 (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

                 IAM User Guide .

              DefaultVersionId -> (string)
                 The  identifier  for the version of the policy that is set as
                 the default version.

              AttachmentCount -> (integer)
                 The number of entities (users, groups, and  roles)  that  the
                 policy is attached to.

              PermissionsBoundaryUsageCount -> (integer)
                 The number of entities (users and roles) for which the policy
                 is used to set the permissions boundary.

                 For  more  information  about  permissions  boundaries,   see
                 Permissions  boundaries  for  IAM  identities in the IAM User
                 Guide .

              IsAttachable -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether the policy can be attached to an IAM  user,
                 group, or role.

              Description -> (string)
                 A friendly description of the policy.

                 This  element  is  included in the response to the  GetPolicy
                 operation. It is not included in the response to  the   List-
                 Policies operation.

              CreateDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time, in ISO 8601 date-time format , when the
                 policy was created.

              UpdateDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format  ,  when  the
                 policy was last updated.

                 When  a  policy has only one version, this field contains the
                 date and time when the policy was created. When a policy  has
                 more  than one version, this field contains the date and time
                 when the most recent policy version was created.

              Tags -> (list)
                 A list of tags that are attached to the instance profile. For
                 more  information about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in
                 the IAM User Guide .

                 (structure)
                     A structure that represents user-provided  metadata  that
                     can be associated with an IAM resource. For more informa-
                     tion about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in the  IAM
                     User Guide .

                     Key -> (string)
                        The  key  name that can be used to look up or retrieve
                        the associated value. For example, Department or  Cost
                        Center are common choices.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The  value associated with this tag. For example, tags
                        with a key name of Department could have  values  such
                        as  Human  Resources , Accounting , and Support . Tags
                        with a key name of Cost Center might have values  that
                        consist  of  the  number associated with the different
                        cost  centers  in  your   company.   Typically,   many
                        resources  have  tags  with the same key name but with
                        different values.

                        NOTE:
                            Amazon Web  Services  always  interprets  the  tag
                            Value  as a single string. If you need to store an
                            array, you can store comma-separated values in the
                            string.  However,  you must interpret the value in
                            your code.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether there are more  items  to  return.  If
          your  results  were  truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination
          request using the Marker request parameter to retrieve  more  items.
          Note that IAM might return fewer than the MaxItems number of results
          even when there are more results available. We  recommend  that  you
          check  IsTruncated  after  every call to ensure that you receive all
          your results.

       Marker -> (string)
          When IsTruncated is true , this element is present and contains  the
          value  to  use  for  the Marker parameter in a subsequent pagination
          request.
