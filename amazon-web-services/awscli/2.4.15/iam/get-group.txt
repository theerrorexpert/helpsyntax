GET-GROUP()                                                        GET-GROUP()



NAME
       get-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of IAM users that are in the specified IAM group. You
       can paginate the results using the MaxItems and Marker parameters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-group is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in
       order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagi-
       nation by providing the --no-paginate argument.   When  using  --output
       text  and  the  --query  argument  on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the  results  of  the  following  query
       expressions: Users

SYNOPSIS
            get-group
          --group-name <value>
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --group-name (string)
          The name of the group.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters consisting of upper  and  lowercase  alphanumeric  characters
          with  no  spaces.  You can also include any of the following charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              This data type is used as a response element  in  the  following
              operations:

              o CreateUser

              o GetUser

              o ListUsers

              Path -> (string)
                 The  path  to the user. For more information about paths, see
                 IAM identifiers in the IAM User Guide .

                 The ARN of the policy used to set  the  permissions  boundary
                 for the user.

              UserName -> (string)
                 The friendly name identifying the user.

              UserId -> (string)
                 The  stable  and unique string identifying the user. For more
                 information about IDs, see IAM identifiers in  the  IAM  User
                 Guide .

              Arn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the user. For
                 more information about ARNs and how to use ARNs in  policies,
                 see IAM Identifiers in the IAM User Guide .

              CreateDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time, in ISO 8601 date-time format , when the
                 user was created.

              PasswordLastUsed -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format  ,  when  the
                 user's  password  was  last  used to sign in to an Amazon Web
                 Services website. For a list of Amazon Web Services  websites
                 that  capture  a user's last sign-in time, see the Credential
                 reports topic in the IAM User Guide . If a password  is  used
                 more  than  once in a five-minute span, only the first use is
                 returned in this field. If the field is null (no value), then
                 it  indicates that they never signed in with a password. This
                 can be because:

                 o The user never had a password.

                 o A password exists but has not been used since  IAM  started
                   tracking this information on October 20, 2014.

                 A  null  value  does not mean that the user never had a pass-
                 word. Also, if the user does not currently  have  a  password
                 but  had  one  in the past, then this field contains the date
                 and time the most recent password was used.

                 This value is returned only in the   GetUser  and   ListUsers
                 operations.

              PermissionsBoundary -> (structure)
                 For   more  information  about  permissions  boundaries,  see
                 Permissions boundaries for IAM identities  in  the  IAM  User
                 Guide .

                 PermissionsBoundaryType -> (string)
                     The  permissions  boundary usage type that indicates what
                     type of IAM resource is used as the permissions  boundary
                     for  an  entity.  This data type can only have a value of
                     Policy .

                 PermissionsBoundaryArn -> (string)
                     The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions  bound-
                     ary for the user or role.

              Tags -> (list)
                 A  list  of  tags that are associated with the user. For more
                 information about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources  in  the
                 IAM User Guide .

                 (structure)
                     A  structure  that represents user-provided metadata that
                     can be associated with an IAM resource. For more informa-
                     tion  about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in the IAM
                     User Guide .

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key name that can be used to look up  or  retrieve
                        the  associated value. For example, Department or Cost
                        Center are common choices.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value associated with this tag. For example,  tags
                        with  a  key name of Department could have values such
                        as Human Resources , Accounting , and Support  .  Tags
                        with  a key name of Cost Center might have values that
                        consist of the number associated  with  the  different
                        cost   centers   in   your  company.  Typically,  many
                        resources have tags with the same key  name  but  with
                        different values.

                        NOTE:
                            Amazon  Web  Services  always  interprets  the tag
                            Value as a single string. If you need to store  an
                            array, you can store comma-separated values in the
                            string. However, you must interpret the  value  in
                            your code.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A  flag  that  indicates  whether there are more items to return. If
          your results were truncated, you can make  a  subsequent  pagination
          request  using  the Marker request parameter to retrieve more items.
          Note that IAM might return fewer than the MaxItems number of results
          even  when  there  are more results available. We recommend that you
          check IsTruncated after every call to ensure that  you  receive  all
          your results.

       Marker -> (string)
          When  IsTruncated is true , this element is present and contains the
          value to use for the Marker parameter  in  a  subsequent  pagination
          request.
