UPDATE-USER()                                                    UPDATE-USER()



NAME
       update-user -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the name and/or the path of the specified IAM user.

       WARNING:
          You  should  understand  the  implications of changing an IAM user's
          path or name. For more information, see Renaming  an  IAM  user  and
          Renaming an IAM group in the IAM User Guide .

       NOTE:
          To  change  a user name, the requester must have appropriate permis-
          sions on both the source object and the target object. For  example,
          to  change  Bob  to  Robert, the entity making the request must have
          permission on Bob and Robert, or must have permission  on  all  (*).
          For more information about permissions, see Permissions and policies
          .

SYNOPSIS
            update-user
          --user-name <value>
          [--new-path <value>]
          [--new-user-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-name (string)
          Name of the user to update. If you're changing the name of the user,
          this is the original user name.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters consisting of upper  and  lowercase  alphanumeric  characters
          with  no  spaces.  You can also include any of the following charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --new-path (string)
          New path for the IAM user. Include this  parameter  only  if  you're
          changing the user's path.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters consisting of either a forward  slash  (/)  by  itself  or  a
          string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it
          can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021 ) through the DEL
          character  (\u007F ), including most punctuation characters, digits,
          and upper and lowercased letters.

       --new-user-name (string)
          New name for the user. Include this parameter only if you're  chang-
          ing the user's name.

          IAM  user,  group,  role, and policy names must be unique within the
          account. Names are not distinguished by case. For example, you  can-
          not create resources named both "MyResource" and "myresource".

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To change an IAM user's name

       to Robert:
