GET-SERVICE-LAST-ACCESSED-DETGET-SERVICE-LAST-ACCESSED-DETAILS-WITH-ENTITIES()



NAME
       get-service-last-accessed-details-with-entities -

DESCRIPTION
       After  you generate a group or policy report using the GenerateService-
       LastAccessedDetails operation, you can use the JobId parameter in  Get-
       ServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities  .  This operation retrieves the
       status of your report job and a list of entities that could  have  used
       group or policy permissions to access the specified service.

       o Group   For a group report, this operation returns a list of users in
         the group that could have used the groups policies in an  attempt  to
         access the service.

       o Policy   For  a policy report, this operation returns a list of enti-
         ties (users or roles) that could have used the policy in  an  attempt
         to access the service.

       You  can  also  use this operation for user or role reports to retrieve
       details about those entities.

       If the operation fails,  the  GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities
       operation returns the reason that it failed.

       By default, the list of associated entities is sorted by date, with the
       most recent access listed first.

SYNOPSIS
            get-service-last-accessed-details-with-entities
          --job-id <value>
          --service-namespace <value>
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--marker <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The ID of the request generated by the  GenerateServiceLastAccessed-
          Details operation.

       --service-namespace (string)
          The  service  namespace  for an Amazon Web Services service. Provide
          the service namespace to learn when the IAM entity last attempted to
          access the specified service.

          To   learn  the  service  namespace  for  a  service,  see  Actions,
          resources, and condition keys for Amazon Web  Services  services  in
          the  IAM User Guide . Choose the name of the service to view details
          for that service. In the first paragraph, find the  service  prefix.
          For example, (service prefix: a4b) . For more information about ser-
          vice namespaces, see Amazon Web Services service namespaces  in  the
          Amazon Web Services General Reference .

       --max-items (integer)
          Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number
          of items you want in the response. If additional items exist  beyond
          the  maximum you specify, the IsTruncated response element is true .

          If you do not include this parameter, the number of  items  defaults
          to  100.  Note  that IAM might return fewer results, even when there
          are more results available. In that case, the  IsTruncated  response
          element returns true , and Marker contains a value to include in the
          subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

       --marker (string)
          Use this parameter only when paginating results and only  after  you
          receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it
          to the value of the Marker element in the response that you received
          to indicate where the next call should start.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve a service access report with details for a service

       The  following  get-service-last-accessed-details-with-entities example
       retrieves a report that contains details  about  IAM  users  and  other
       entities that accessed the specified service. To generate a report, use
       the generate-service-last-accessed-details command. To get  a  list  of
       services      accessed      with      namespaces,      use     get-ser-
       vice-last-accessed-details.

          aws iam get-service-last-accessed-details-with-entities \
              --job-id 78b6c2ba-d09e-6xmp-7039-ecde30b26916 \
              --service-namespace lambda

       Output:

OUTPUT
       JobStatus -> (string)
          The status of the job.

       JobCreationDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format ,  when  the  report
          job was created.

       JobCompletionDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format , when the generated
          report job was completed or failed.

          This field is null if the job is still in progress, as indicated  by
          a job status value of IN_PROGRESS .

       EntityDetailsList -> (list)
          An  EntityDetailsList object that contains details about when an IAM
          entity (user or role) used group or policy permissions in an attempt
          to access the specified Amazon Web Services service.

          (structure)
              An  object  that  contains  details  about when the IAM entities
              (users or roles) were last used in  an  attempt  to  access  the
              specified Amazon Web Services service.

              This  data  type is a response element in the  GetServiceLastAc-
              cessedDetailsWithEntities operation.

              EntityInfo -> (structure)
                 The EntityInfo object that contains details about the  entity
                 (user or role).

                 Arn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN). ARNs are unique identi-
                     fiers for Amazon Web Services resources.

                     For more information about ARNs, go  to  Amazon  Resource
                     Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference
                     .

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name of the entity (user or role).

                 Type -> (string)
                     The type of entity (user or role).

                 Id -> (string)
                     The identifier of the entity (user or role).

                 Path -> (string)
                     The path to the entity (user or role). For more  informa-
                     tion  about  paths,  see  IAM identifiers in the IAM User
                     Guide .

              LastAuthenticated -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format  ,  when  the
                 authenticated entity last attempted to access Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices. Amazon Web Services does  not  report  unauthenticated
                 requests.

                 This field is null if no IAM entities attempted to access the
                 service within the reporting period .

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether there are more  items  to  return.  If
          your  results  were  truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination
          request using the Marker request parameter to retrieve  more  items.
          Note that IAM might return fewer than the MaxItems number of results
          even when there are more results available. We  recommend  that  you
          check  IsTruncated  after  every call to ensure that you receive all
          your results.

       Marker -> (string)
          When IsTruncated is true , this element is present and contains  the
          value  to  use  for  the Marker parameter in a subsequent pagination
          request.

       Error -> (structure)
          An object that contains  details  about  the  reason  the  operation
          failed.

          Message -> (string)
              Detailed information about the reason that the operation failed.

          Code -> (string)
              The error code associated with the operation failure.
