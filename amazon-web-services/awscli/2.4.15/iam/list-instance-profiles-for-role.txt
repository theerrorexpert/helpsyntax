LIST-INSTANCE-PROFILES-FOR-ROLE()            LIST-INSTANCE-PROFILES-FOR-ROLE()



NAME
       list-instance-profiles-for-role -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  instance  profiles  that  have the specified associated IAM
       role. If there are none, the operation returns an empty list. For  more
       information about instance profiles, go to About instance profiles .

       You  can paginate the results using the MaxItems and Marker parameters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-instance-profiles-for-role is a paginated operation. Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: InstanceProfiles

SYNOPSIS
            list-instance-profiles-for-role
          --role-name <value>
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --role-name (string)
          The name of the role to list instance profiles for.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters consisting of upper  and  lowercase  alphanumeric  characters
          with  no  spaces.  You can also include any of the following charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the instance profiles for an IAM role

       The   following   list-instance-profiles-for-role   command  lists  the
       instance profiles that are associated with the role Test-Role:

                            resources in the IAM User Guide .

                            Key -> (string)
                               The key name that can be used  to  look  up  or
                               retrieve  the  associated  value.  For example,
                               Department or Cost Center are common choices.

                            Value -> (string)
                               The value associated with this tag.  For  exam-
                               ple,  tags  with a key name of Department could
                               have values such as Human Resources ,  Account-
                               ing  ,  and  Support  . Tags with a key name of
                               Cost Center might have values that  consist  of
                               the  number  associated with the different cost
                               centers  in  your  company.   Typically,   many
                               resources  have tags with the same key name but
                               with different values.

                               NOTE:
                                   Amazon Web Services always  interprets  the
                                   tag  Value  as a single string. If you need
                                   to store an array, you can store comma-sep-
                                   arated  values  in the string. However, you
                                   must interpret the value in your code.

                     RoleLastUsed -> (structure)
                        Contains information about the last time that  an  IAM
                        role was used. This includes the date and time and the
                        Region in which the role was last  used.  Activity  is
                        only  reported  for the trailing 400 days. This period
                        can be shorter if your Region began  supporting  these
                        features  within  the  last  year. The role might have
                        been used more than 400 days ago.  For  more  informa-
                        tion,  see  Regions  where  data is tracked in the IAM
                        User Guide .

                        LastUsedDate -> (timestamp)
                            The date and time, in ISO  8601  date-time  format
                            that the role was last used.

                            This  field  is null if the role has not been used
                            within the IAM tracking period. For more  informa-
                            tion  about the tracking period, see Regions where
                            data is tracked in the IAM User Guide .

                        Region -> (string)
                            The name of the  Amazon  Web  Services  Region  in
                            which the role was last used.

              Tags -> (list)
                 A list of tags that are attached to the instance profile. For
                 more information about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources  in
                 the IAM User Guide .

                 (structure)
                     A  structure  that represents user-provided metadata that
                     can be associated with an IAM resource. For more informa-
                     tion  about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in the IAM
                     User Guide .

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key name that can be used to look up  or  retrieve
                        the  associated value. For example, Department or Cost
                        Center are common choices.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value associated with this tag. For example,  tags
                        with  a  key name of Department could have values such
                        as Human Resources , Accounting , and Support  .  Tags
                        with  a key name of Cost Center might have values that
                        consist of the number associated  with  the  different
                        cost   centers   in   your  company.  Typically,  many
                        resources have tags with the same key  name  but  with
                        different values.

                        NOTE:
                            Amazon  Web  Services  always  interprets  the tag
                            Value as a single string. If you need to store  an
                            array, you can store comma-separated values in the
                            string. However, you must interpret the  value  in
                            your code.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A  flag  that  indicates  whether there are more items to return. If
          your results were truncated, you can make  a  subsequent  pagination
          request  using  the Marker request parameter to retrieve more items.
          Note that IAM might return fewer than the MaxItems number of results
          even  when  there  are more results available. We recommend that you
          check IsTruncated after every call to ensure that  you  receive  all
          your results.

       Marker -> (string)
          When  IsTruncated is true , this element is present and contains the
          value to use for the Marker parameter  in  a  subsequent  pagination
          request.
