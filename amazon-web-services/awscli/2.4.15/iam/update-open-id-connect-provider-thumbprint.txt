UPDATE-OPEN-ID-CONNECT-PROVIDER-THUPDATE-OPEN-ID-CONNECT-PROVIDER-THUMBPRINT()



NAME
       update-open-id-connect-provider-thumbprint -

DESCRIPTION
       Replaces the existing list of server certificate thumbprints associated
       with an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider resource object with a new  list
       of thumbprints.

       The  list  that  you  pass  with this operation completely replaces the
       existing list of thumbprints. (The lists are not merged.)

       Typically, you need to update  a  thumbprint  only  when  the  identity
       provider  certificate  changes,  which  occurs  rarely. However, if the
       provider's certificate does change, any attempt to assume an  IAM  role
       that  specifies  the  OIDC provider as a principal fails until the cer-
       tificate thumbprint is updated.

       NOTE:
          Amazon Web Services secures communication with  some  OIDC  identity
          providers (IdPs) through our library of trusted certificate authori-
          ties (CAs) instead of using a certificate thumbprint to verify  your
          IdP  server  certificate.  These OIDC IdPs include Google, and those
          that use an Amazon S3 bucket to host a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)  end-
          point.  In  these cases, your legacy thumbprint remains in your con-
          figuration, but is no longer used for validation.

       NOTE:
          Trust for the OIDC provider is derived from the provider certificate
          and  is  validated by the thumbprint. Therefore, it is best to limit
          access to  the  UpdateOpenIDConnectProviderThumbprint  operation  to
          highly privileged users.

SYNOPSIS
            update-open-id-connect-provider-thumbprint
          --open-id-connect-provider-arn <value>
          --thumbprint-list <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --open-id-connect-provider-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the IAM OIDC provider resource
          object for which you want to update the thumbprint. You  can  get  a
          list  of OIDC provider ARNs by using the  ListOpenIDConnectProviders
          operation.

          For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in
          the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

       --thumbprint-list (list)
          A list of certificate thumbprints that are associated with the spec-
          ified IAM OpenID Connect provider. For more information,  see   Cre-
          ateOpenIDConnectProvider .

          (string)
              Contains a thumbprint for an identity provider's server certifi-
              cate.

              The identity provider's server  certificate  thumbprint  is  the
              hex-encoded  SHA-1  hash value of the self-signed X.509 certifi-
              cate. This thumbprint is used by the  domain  where  the  OpenID
              Connect  provider  makes  its  keys available. The thumbprint is
              always a 40-character string.

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To replace the existing list of server certificate thumbprints  with  a
       new list

       This  example  updates  the  certificate  thumbprint  list for the OIDC
       provider  whose  ARN  is  arn:aws:iam::123456789012:oidc-provider/exam-
       ple.oidcprovider.com to use a new thumbprint:

          aws iam update-open-id-connect-provider-thumbprint --open-id-connect-provider-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:oidc-provider/example.oidcprovider.com --thumbprint-list 7359755EXAMPLEabc3060bce3EXAMPLEec4542a3

OUTPUT
       None
