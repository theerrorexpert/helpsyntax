GET-ACCOUNT-PASSWORD-POLICY()                    GET-ACCOUNT-PASSWORD-POLICY()



NAME
       get-account-password-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the password policy for the Amazon Web Services account. This
       tells you the complexity requirements and  mandatory  rotation  periods
       for  the IAM user passwords in your account. For more information about
       using a password policy, see Managing an IAM password policy .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-account-password-policy
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To see the current account password policy

       The  following  get-account-password-policy  command  displays  details
       about the password policy for the current account:

          aws iam get-account-password-policy

       Output:

          {
              "PasswordPolicy": {
                  "AllowUsersToChangePassword": false,
                  "RequireLowercaseCharacters": false,
                  "RequireUppercaseCharacters": false,
                  "MinimumPasswordLength": 8,
                  "RequireNumbers": true,
                  "RequireSymbols": true
              }
          }

       If no password policy is defined for the account, the command returns a
       NoSuchEntity error.

       For more information, see Managing an IAM Password Policy in the  Using
       IAM guide.
