NAME
       remove-role-from-instance-profile -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes the specified IAM role from the specified EC2 instance profile.

       WARNING:
          Make sure that you do not have any Amazon EC2 instances running with
          the role you are about to remove from the instance profile. Removing
          a role from an instance profile that is associated  with  a  running
          instance might break any applications running on the instance.

       For more information about IAM roles, see Working with roles . For more
       information about instance profiles, see About instance profiles .

SYNOPSIS
            remove-role-from-instance-profile
          --instance-profile-name <value>
          --role-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-profile-name (string)
          The name of the instance profile to update.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  upper  and lowercase alphanumeric characters
          with no spaces. You can also include any of  the  following  charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --role-name (string)
          The name of the role to remove.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
