DELETE-SERVICE-LINKED-ROLE()                      DELETE-SERVICE-LINKED-ROLE()



NAME
       delete-service-linked-role -

DESCRIPTION
       Submits  a service-linked role deletion request and returns a Deletion-
       TaskId , which you can use to check the status of the deletion.  Before
       you  call  this operation, confirm that the role has no active sessions
       and that any resources used by the  role  in  the  linked  service  are
       deleted.  If  you  call this operation more than once for the same ser-
       vice-linked role and an earlier deletion task is not complete, then the
       DeletionTaskId of the earlier request is returned.

       If you submit a deletion request for a service-linked role whose linked
       service is still accessing a resource, then the deletion task fails. If
       it fails, the  GetServiceLinkedRoleDeletionStatus operation returns the
       reason for the failure, usually including the resources  that  must  be
       deleted. To delete the service-linked role, you must first remove those
       resources from the linked service and then submit the deletion  request
       again.  Resources  are  specific  to  the service that is linked to the
       role. For more information about removing resources from a service, see
       the Amazon Web Services documentation for your service.

       For  more  information  about service-linked roles, see Roles terms and
       concepts: Amazon Web Services service-linked role in the IAM User Guide
       .

SYNOPSIS
            delete-service-linked-role
          --role-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --role-name (string)
          The name of the service-linked role to be deleted.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a service-linked role

       The  following delete-service-linked-role example deletes the specified
       service-linked role that you no longer need. The deletion happens asyn-
       chronously.  You  can check the status of the deletion and confirm when
       it is done by using  the  get-service-linked-role-deletion-status  com-
       mand.

          aws iam delete-service-linked-role --role-name AWSServiceRoleForLexBots

       Output:

          {
              "DeletionTaskId": "task/aws-service-role/lex.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForLexBots/1a2b3c4d-1234-abcd-7890-abcdeEXAMPLE"
          }

       For  more  information,  see Using Service-Linked Roles in the IAM User
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       DeletionTaskId -> (string)
          The deletion task identifier that you can use to check the status of
          the   deletion.   This   identifier   is   returned  in  the  format
          task/aws-service-role/<service-princi-
          pal-name>/<role-name>/<task-uuid> .
