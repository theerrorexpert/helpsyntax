TAG-ROLE()                                                          TAG-ROLE()



NAME
       tag-role -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds one or more tags to an IAM role. The role can be a regular role or
       a service-linked role. If a tag with the same key name already  exists,
       then that tag is overwritten with the new value.

       A tag consists of a key name and an associated value. By assigning tags
       to your resources, you can do the following:

       o Administrative grouping and discovery - Attach tags to  resources  to
         aid in organization and search. For example, you could search for all
         resources with the key name Project and the value  MyImportantProject
         .  Or  search for all resources with the key name Cost Center and the
         value 41200 .

       o Access control - Include tags in IAM  user-based  and  resource-based
         policies.  You  can  use  tags to restrict access to only an IAM role
         that has a specified tag attached. You can also  restrict  access  to
         only  those  resources that have a certain tag attached. For examples
         of policies that show how to use tags to control access, see  Control
         access using IAM tags in the IAM User Guide .

       o Cost  allocation - Use tags to help track which individuals and teams
         are using which Amazon Web Services resources.

       NOTE:

          o If any one of the tags is invalid or if  you  exceed  the  allowed
            maximum  number  of  tags,  then  the entire request fails and the
            resource is not created. For more information about  tagging,  see
            Tagging IAM resources in the IAM User Guide .

          o Amazon  Web  Services  always interprets the tag Value as a single
            string. If you need to store an array, you can  store  comma-sepa-
            rated  values in the string. However, you must interpret the value
            in your code.

       For more information about tagging, see Tagging IAM identities  in  the
       IAM User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            tag-role
          --role-name <value>
          --tags <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --role-name (string)
          The name of the IAM role to which you want to add tags.

          This  parameter  accepts  (through  its  regex pattern ) a string of
          characters that consist of upper and lowercase alphanumeric  charac-
          ters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following char-
          acters: _+=,.@-

       --tags (list)
          The list of tags that you want to attach to the IAM role.  Each  tag
          consists of a key name and an associated value.

          (structure)
              A  structure  that represents user-provided metadata that can be
              associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tag-
              ging, see Tagging IAM resources in the IAM User Guide .

              Key -> (string)
                 The  key  name  that  can  be used to look up or retrieve the
                 associated value. For example, Department or Cost Center  are
                 common choices.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a
                 key name of  Department  could  have  values  such  as  Human
                 Resources  ,  Accounting , and Support . Tags with a key name
                 of Cost Center might have values that consist of  the  number
                 associated  with  the different cost centers in your company.
                 Typically, many resources have tags with the  same  key  name
                 but with different values.

                 NOTE:
                     Amazon  Web Services always interprets the tag Value as a
                     single string. If you need to store  an  array,  you  can
                     store  comma-separated values in the string. However, you
                     must interpret the value in your code.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To add a tag to a role

       The following tag-role command adds a tag with a Department name to the
       specified role. This command produces no output.

          aws iam tag-role --role-name my-role --tags '{"Key": "Department", "Value": "Accounting"}'
