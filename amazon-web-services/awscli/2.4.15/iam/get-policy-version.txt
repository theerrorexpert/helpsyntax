GET-POLICY-VERSION()                                      GET-POLICY-VERSION()



NAME
       get-policy-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information about the specified version of the specified man-
       aged policy, including the policy document.

       NOTE:
          Policies returned by this operation are URL-encoded  compliant  with
          RFC  3986  . You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy
          back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you  can  use
          the  decode  method  of the java.net.URLDecoder utility class in the
          Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality.

       To list the available versions for a policy, use  ListPolicyVersions  .

       This   operation  retrieves  information  about  managed  policies.  To
       retrieve information about an inline policy that is embedded in a user,
       group,  or role, use  GetUserPolicy ,  GetGroupPolicy , or  GetRolePol-
       icy .

       For more information about the types of policies, see Managed  policies
       and inline policies in the IAM User Guide .

       For  more information about managed policy versions, see Versioning for
       managed policies in the IAM User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            get-policy-version
          --policy-arn <value>
          --version-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --policy-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the managed policy that  you  want
          information about.

          For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in
          the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

       --version-id (string)
          Identifies the policy version to retrieve.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  that consists of the lowercase letter 'v' followed by one or
          two digits, and optionally followed by a period '.' and a string  of
          letters and digits.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To  retrieve  information  about the specified version of the specified
       managed policy

       This example returns the policy document for the v2 version of the pol-
       icy whose ARN is arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/MyManagedPolicy:

          aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/MyPolicy --version-id v2

       Output:

          {
              "PolicyVersion": {
                  "CreateDate": "2015-06-17T19:23;32Z",
                  "VersionId": "v2",
                  "Document": {
                                "Version": "2012-10-17",
                                "Statement": [
                                        {
                                                "Action": "iam:*",
                                                "Resource": "*",
                                                "Effect": "Allow"
                                        }
                                ]
                          }
                  "IsDefaultVersion": "false"
              }
          }

       guide.

OUTPUT
       PolicyVersion -> (structure)
          A structure containing details about the policy version.

          Document -> (string)
              The policy document.

              The policy document is returned in the response to the  GetPoli-
              cyVersion  and  GetAccountAuthorizationDetails operations. It is
              not returned in the  response  to  the   CreatePolicyVersion  or
              ListPolicyVersions operations.

              The  policy  document  returned in this structure is URL-encoded
              compliant with RFC 3986 . You can use a URL decoding  method  to
              convert  the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if you
              use Java, you can use the decode method of  the  java.net.URLDe-
              coder  utility  class  in the Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs
              provide similar functionality.

          VersionId -> (string)
              The identifier for the policy version.

              Policy version identifiers always begin with  v  (always  lower-
              case).  When a policy is created, the first policy version is v1
              .

          IsDefaultVersion -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether the policy version  is  set  as  the  policy's
              default version.

          CreateDate -> (timestamp)
              The  date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format , when the pol-
              icy version was created.
