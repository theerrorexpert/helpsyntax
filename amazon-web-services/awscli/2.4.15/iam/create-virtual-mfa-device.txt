CREATE-VIRTUAL-MFA-DEVICE()                        CREATE-VIRTUAL-MFA-DEVICE()



NAME
       create-virtual-mfa-device -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new virtual MFA device for the Amazon Web Services account.
       After creating the virtual MFA, use  EnableMFADevice to attach the  MFA
       device  to an IAM user. For more information about creating and working
       with virtual MFA devices, see Using a virtual MFA  device  in  the  IAM
       User Guide .

       For information about the maximum number of MFA devices you can create,
       see IAM and STS quotas in the IAM User Guide .

       WARNING:
          The seed information contained in the QR code and the Base32  string
          should be treated like any other secret access information. In other
          words, protect the seed information as you  would  your  Amazon  Web
          Services  access  keys  or  your passwords. After you provision your
          virtual device, you should ensure that the information is  destroyed
          following secure procedures.

SYNOPSIS
            create-virtual-mfa-device
          [--path <value>]
          --virtual-mfa-device-name <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          --outfile <value>
          --bootstrap-method <value>

OPTIONS
       --path (string)
          The  path  for  the  virtual  MFA device. For more information about
          paths, see IAM identifiers in the IAM User Guide .

          This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to  a
          slash (/).

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters consisting of either a forward  slash  (/)  by  itself  or  a
          string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it
          can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021 ) through the DEL
          character  (\u007F ), including most punctuation characters, digits,
          and upper and lowercased letters.

       --virtual-mfa-device-name (string)
          The name of the virtual MFA device. Use with path to uniquely  iden-
          tify a virtual MFA device.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters consisting of upper  and  lowercase  alphanumeric  characters
          with  no  spaces.  You can also include any of the following charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags that you want to attach to the new  IAM  virtual  MFA
          device. Each tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For
          more information about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in the IAM
          User Guide .

          NOTE:
              If  any  one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed
              maximum number of tags, then the entire request  fails  and  the
              resource is not created.

          (structure)
              A  structure  that represents user-provided metadata that can be
              associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tag-
              ging, see Tagging IAM resources in the IAM User Guide .

              Key -> (string)
                 The  key  name  that  can  be used to look up or retrieve the
                 associated value. For example, Department or Cost Center  are
                 common choices.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a
                 key name of  Department  could  have  values  such  as  Human
                 Resources  ,  Accounting , and Support . Tags with a key name
                 of Cost Center might have values that consist of  the  number
                 associated  with  the different cost centers in your company.
                 Typically, many resources have tags with the  same  key  name
                 but with different values.

                 NOTE:
                     Amazon  Web Services always interprets the tag Value as a
                     single string. If you need to store  an  array,  you  can
                     store  comma-separated values in the string. However, you
                     must interpret the value in your code.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --outfile (string) The output path and file name  where  the  bootstrap
       information will be stored.

       --bootstrap-method  (string)  Method  to  use  to seed the virtual MFA.
       Valid values are: QRCodePNG | Base32StringSeed

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a virtual MFA device

       This example creates a new virtual MFA device called BobsMFADevice.  It
       creates  a  file  that contains bootstrap information called QRCode.png
       and places it in the C:/ directory. The bootstrap method used  in  this
       example is QRCodePNG:

          aws iam create-virtual-mfa-device --virtual-mfa-device-name BobsMFADevice --outfile C:/QRCode.png --bootstrap-method QRCodePNG

       Output:

          {
              "VirtualMFADevice": {
                  "SerialNumber": "arn:aws:iam::210987654321:mfa/BobsMFADevice"
          }

       For  more  information,  see  Using  Multi-Factor  Authentication (MFA)
       Devices with AWS in the Using IAM guide.

              Base32String  is  the  seed  in  base32 format. The Base32String
              value is base64-encoded.

          User -> (structure)
              The IAM user associated with this virtual MFA device.

              Path -> (string)
                 The path to the user. For more information about  paths,  see
                 IAM identifiers in the IAM User Guide .

                 The  ARN  of  the policy used to set the permissions boundary
                 for the user.

              UserName -> (string)
                 The friendly name identifying the user.

              UserId -> (string)
                 The stable and unique string identifying the user.  For  more
                 information  about  IDs,  see IAM identifiers in the IAM User
                 Guide .

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the user.  For
                 more  information about ARNs and how to use ARNs in policies,
                 see IAM Identifiers in the IAM User Guide .

              CreateDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format  ,  when  the
                 user was created.

              PasswordLastUsed -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time, in ISO 8601 date-time format , when the
                 user's password was last used to sign in  to  an  Amazon  Web
                 Services  website. For a list of Amazon Web Services websites
                 that capture a user's last sign-in time, see  the  Credential
                 reports  topic  in the IAM User Guide . If a password is used
                 more than once in a five-minute span, only the first  use  is
                 returned in this field. If the field is null (no value), then
                 it indicates that they never signed in with a password.  This
                 can be because:

                 o The user never had a password.

                 o A  password  exists but has not been used since IAM started
                   tracking this information on October 20, 2014.

                 A null value does not mean that the user never  had  a  pass-
                 word.  Also,  if  the user does not currently have a password
                 but had one in the past, then this field  contains  the  date
                 and time the most recent password was used.

                 This  value  is  returned only in the  GetUser and  ListUsers
                 operations.

              PermissionsBoundary -> (structure)
                 For  more  information  about  permissions  boundaries,   see
                 Permissions  boundaries  for  IAM  identities in the IAM User
                 Guide .

                 PermissionsBoundaryType -> (string)
                     The permissions boundary usage type that  indicates  what
                     type  of IAM resource is used as the permissions boundary
                     for an entity. This data type can only have  a  value  of
                     Policy .

                 PermissionsBoundaryArn -> (string)
                     The  ARN of the policy used to set the permissions bound-
                     ary for the user or role.

              Tags -> (list)
                 A list of tags that are associated with the  user.  For  more
                 information  about  tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in the
                 IAM User Guide .

                 (structure)
                     A structure that represents user-provided  metadata  that
                     can be associated with an IAM resource. For more informa-
                     tion about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in the  IAM
                     User Guide .

                     Key -> (string)
                        The  key  name that can be used to look up or retrieve
                        the associated value. For example, Department or  Cost
                        Center are common choices.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The  value associated with this tag. For example, tags
                        with a key name of Department could have  values  such
                        as  Human  Resources , Accounting , and Support . Tags
                        with a key name of Cost Center might have values  that
                        consist  of  the  number associated with the different
                        cost  centers  in  your   company.   Typically,   many
                        resources  have  tags  with the same key name but with
                        different values.

                        NOTE:
                            Amazon Web  Services  always  interprets  the  tag
                            Value  as a single string. If you need to store an
                            array, you can store comma-separated values in the
                            string.  However,  you must interpret the value in
                            your code.

          EnableDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time on which the virtual MFA device was enabled.

          Tags -> (list)
              A list of tags that are attached to the virtual MFA device.  For
              more information about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in the
              IAM User Guide .

              (structure)
                 A structure that represents user-provided metadata  that  can
                 be  associated  with  an  IAM  resource. For more information
                 about tagging, see Tagging IAM  resources  in  the  IAM  User
                 Guide .

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the
                     associated value. For example, Department or Cost  Center
                     are common choices.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  value  associated  with  this tag. For example, tags
                     with a key name of Department could have values  such  as
                     Human  Resources , Accounting , and Support . Tags with a
                     key name of Cost Center might have values that consist of
                     the  number associated with the different cost centers in
                     your company. Typically, many resources  have  tags  with
                     the same key name but with different values.

                     NOTE:
                        Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag Value as
                        a single string. If you need to store  an  array,  you
                        can  store  comma-separated values in the string. How-
                        ever, you must interpret the value in your code.
