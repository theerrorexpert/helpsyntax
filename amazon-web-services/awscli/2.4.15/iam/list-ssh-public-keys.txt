LIST-SSH-PUBLIC-KEYS()                                  LIST-SSH-PUBLIC-KEYS()



NAME
       list-ssh-public-keys -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about the SSH public keys associated with the spec-
       ified IAM user. If none exists, the operation returns an empty list.

       The SSH public keys returned  by  this  operation  are  used  only  for
       authenticating  the  IAM  user  to  an  CodeCommit repository. For more
       information about using SSH  keys  to  authenticate  to  an  CodeCommit
       repository, see Set up CodeCommit for SSH connections in the CodeCommit
       User Guide .

       Although each user is limited to a small number of keys, you can  still
       paginate the results using the MaxItems and Marker parameters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-ssh-public-keys  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: SSHPublicKeys

SYNOPSIS
            list-ssh-public-keys
          [--user-name <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-name (string)
          The name of the IAM user to list SSH public keys  for.  If  none  is
          specified,  the UserName field is determined implicitly based on the
          Amazon Web Services access key used to sign the request.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  upper  and lowercase alphanumeric characters
          with no spaces. You can also include any of  the  following  charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the SSH public keys attached to an IAM user

       The following list-ssh-public-keys example lists the  SSH  public  keys
       attached to the IAM user sofia.

          aws iam list-ssh-public-keys  --user-name sofia

       Output:

          {
              "SSHPublicKeys": [
                  {
                      "UserName": "sofia",
                      "SSHPublicKeyId": "APKA1234567890EXAMPLE",
                      "Status": "Inactive",
                      "UploadDate": "2019-04-18T17:04:49+00:00"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       SSHPublicKeys -> (list)
          A list of the SSH public keys assigned to IAM user.

          (structure)
              Contains information about an SSH public key, without the  key's
              body or fingerprint.

              This data type is used as a response element in the  ListSSHPub-
              licKeys operation.

              UserName -> (string)
                 The name of the IAM user associated with the SSH public  key.

              SSHPublicKeyId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the SSH public key.

              Status -> (string)
                 The  status  of the SSH public key. Active means that the key
                 can be used for authentication with an CodeCommit repository.
                 Inactive means that the key cannot be used.

              UploadDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time, in ISO 8601 date-time format , when the
                 SSH public key was uploaded.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether there are more  items  to  return.  If
          your  results  were  truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination
          request using the Marker request parameter to retrieve  more  items.
          Note that IAM might return fewer than the MaxItems number of results
          even when there are more results available. We  recommend  that  you
          check  IsTruncated  after  every call to ensure that you receive all
          your results.

       Marker -> (string)
          When IsTruncated is true , this element is present and contains  the
          value  to  use  for  the Marker parameter in a subsequent pagination
          request.
