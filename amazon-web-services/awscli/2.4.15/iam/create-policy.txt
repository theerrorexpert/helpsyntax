CREATE-POLICY()                                                CREATE-POLICY()



NAME
       create-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new managed policy for your Amazon Web Services account.

       This operation creates a policy version with a version identifier of v1
       and sets v1 as the policy's default version. For more information about
       policy  versions,  see  Versioning for managed policies in the IAM User
       Guide .

       As a best practice, you can validate your IAM policies. To learn  more,
       see Validating IAM policies in the IAM User Guide .

       For  more  information  about  managed policies in general, see Managed
       policies and inline policies in the IAM User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-policy
          --policy-name <value>
          [--path <value>]
          --policy-document <value>
          [--description <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --policy-name (string)
          The friendly name of the policy.

          IAM user, group, role, and policy names must be  unique  within  the
          account.  Names are not distinguished by case. For example, you can-
          not create resources named both "MyResource" and "myresource".

       --path (string)
          The path for the policy.

          For more information about paths, see IAM  identifiers  in  the  IAM
          User Guide .

          This  parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a
          slash (/).

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  either  a  forward  slash (/) by itself or a
          string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it
          can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021 ) through the DEL
          character (\u007F ), including most punctuation characters,  digits,
          and upper and lowercased letters.

          NOTE:
              You cannot use an asterisk (*) in the path name.

       --policy-document (string)
          The JSON policy document that you want to use as the content for the
          new policy.

          You must provide policies in JSON format in IAM. However, for Cloud-
          Formation templates formatted in YAML, you can provide the policy in
          JSON or YAML format. CloudFormation always converts a YAML policy to
          JSON format before submitting it to IAM.

          The  maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this
          operation, including whitespace, is listed below. To view the  maxi-
          mum  character  counts  of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see
          IAM and STS character quotas .

          To learn more about JSON policy grammar, see Grammar of the IAM JSON
          policy language in the IAM User Guide .

          The  regex  pattern  used  to validate this parameter is a string of
          characters consisting of the following:

          o Any printable ASCII character ranging  from  the  space  character
            (\u0020 ) through the end of the ASCII character range

          o The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement
            character set (through \u00FF )

          o The special characters tab (\u0009 ), line  feed  (\u000A  ),  and
            carriage return (\u000D )

       --description (string)
          A friendly description of the policy.

          Typically used to store information about the permissions defined in
          the policy. For  example,  "Grants  access  to  production  DynamoDB
          tables."

          The  policy  description is immutable. After a value is assigned, it
          cannot be changed.

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags that you want to attach to the new IAM customer  man-
          aged  policy.  Each  tag  consists  of  a key name and an associated
          value. For more information about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources
          in the IAM User Guide .

          NOTE:
              If  any  one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed
              maximum number of tags, then the entire request  fails  and  the
              resource is not created.

          (structure)
              A  structure  that represents user-provided metadata that can be
              associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tag-
              ging, see Tagging IAM resources in the IAM User Guide .

              Key -> (string)
                 The  key  name  that  can  be used to look up or retrieve the
                 associated value. For example, Department or Cost Center  are
                 common choices.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a
                 key name of  Department  could  have  values  such  as  Human
                 Resources  ,  Accounting , and Support . Tags with a key name
                 of Cost Center might have values that consist of  the  number
                 associated  with  the different cost centers in your company.
                 Typically, many resources have tags with the  same  key  name
                 but with different values.

                 NOTE:
                     Amazon  Web Services always interprets the tag Value as a
                     single string. If you need to store  an  array,  you  can
                     store  comma-separated values in the string. However, you
                     must interpret the value in your code.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command creates a customer managed policy  named  my-pol-
       icy:

          aws iam create-policy --policy-name my-policy --policy-document file://policy

       Output:

          {
              "Policy": {
                  "PolicyName": "my-policy",
                  "CreateDate": "2015-06-01T19:31:18.620Z",
                  "AttachmentCount": 0,
                  "IsAttachable": true,
                  "PolicyId": "ZXR6A36LTYANPAI7NJ5UV",
                  "DefaultVersionId": "v1",
                  "Path": "/",
                  "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::0123456789012:policy/my-policy",
                  "UpdateDate": "2015-06-01T19:31:18.620Z"
              }
          }

       The  file  policy  is a JSON document in the current folder that grants
       read only access to the shared folder in  an  Amazon  S3  bucket  named
       my-bucket:

          {
              "Version": "2012-10-17",
              "Statement": [
                  {
                      "Effect": "Allow",
                      "Action": [
                          "s3:Get*",
                          "s3:List*"
                      ],
                      "Resource": [
                          "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/shared/*"
                      ]
                  }
              ]
          }

              Permissions boundaries for IAM identities in the IAM User  Guide
              .

          IsAttachable -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  the  policy  can be attached to an IAM user,
              group, or role.

          Description -> (string)
              A friendly description of the policy.

              This element is included in the response to the  GetPolicy oper-
              ation.  It  is not included in the response to the  ListPolicies
              operation.

          CreateDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format , when the  pol-
              icy was created.

          UpdateDate -> (timestamp)
              The  date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format , when the pol-
              icy was last updated.

              When a policy has only one version, this field contains the date
              and  time  when  the  policy was created. When a policy has more
              than one version, this field contains the date and time when the
              most recent policy version was created.

          Tags -> (list)
              A  list  of  tags that are attached to the instance profile. For
              more information about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in the
              IAM User Guide .

              (structure)
                 A  structure  that represents user-provided metadata that can
                 be associated with an  IAM  resource.  For  more  information
                 about  tagging,  see  Tagging  IAM  resources in the IAM User
                 Guide .

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve  the
                     associated  value. For example, Department or Cost Center
                     are common choices.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value associated with this  tag.  For  example,  tags
                     with  a  key name of Department could have values such as
                     Human Resources , Accounting , and Support . Tags with  a
                     key name of Cost Center might have values that consist of
                     the number associated with the different cost centers  in
                     your  company.  Typically,  many resources have tags with
                     the same key name but with different values.

                     NOTE:
                        Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag Value as
                        a  single  string.  If you need to store an array, you
                        can store comma-separated values in the  string.  How-
                        ever, you must interpret the value in your code.
