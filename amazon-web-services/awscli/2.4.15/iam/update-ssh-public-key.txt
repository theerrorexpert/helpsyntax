UPDATE-SSH-PUBLIC-KEY()                                UPDATE-SSH-PUBLIC-KEY()



NAME
       update-ssh-public-key -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets  the status of an IAM user's SSH public key to active or inactive.
       SSH public keys that are inactive cannot be  used  for  authentication.
       This  operation  can be used to disable a user's SSH public key as part
       of a key rotation work flow.

       The SSH public key affected by this operation is used only for  authen-
       ticating  the associated IAM user to an CodeCommit repository. For more
       information about using SSH  keys  to  authenticate  to  an  CodeCommit
       repository, see Set up CodeCommit for SSH connections in the CodeCommit
       User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-ssh-public-key
          --user-name <value>
          --ssh-public-key-id <value>
          --status <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-name (string)
          The name of the IAM user associated with the SSH public key.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  upper  and lowercase alphanumeric characters
          with no spaces. You can also include any of  the  following  charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --ssh-public-key-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the SSH public key.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters that can consist of any upper or lowercased letter or  digit.

       --status (string)
          The  status  to  assign to the SSH public key. Active means that the
          key can be used for authentication with  an  CodeCommit  repository.
          Inactive means that the key cannot be used.

          Possible values:

          o Active

          o Inactive

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To change the status of an SSH public key

       The  following  update-ssh-public-key command changes the status of the
       specified public key to Inactive.

          aws iam update-ssh-public-key \
              --user-name sofia \
              --ssh-public-key-id APKA1234567890EXAMPLE \
              --status Inactive

       This command produces no output.
