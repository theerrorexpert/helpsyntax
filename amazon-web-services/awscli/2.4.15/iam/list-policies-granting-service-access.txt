LIST-POLICIES-GRANTING-SERVICE-ACCESS()LIST-POLICIES-GRANTING-SERVICE-ACCESS()



NAME
       list-policies-granting-service-access -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  list  of  policies that the IAM identity (user, group, or
       role) can use to access each specified service.

       NOTE:
          This operation does not use  other  policy  types  when  determining
          whether  a resource could access a service. These other policy types
          include resource-based policies, access control lists, Organizations
          policies,  IAM permissions boundaries, and STS assume role policies.
          It only applies permissions policy logic. For more about the evalua-
          tion  of policy types, see Evaluating policies in the IAM User Guide
          .

       The list of policies returned by the operation depends on  the  ARN  of
       the identity that you provide.

       o User   The  list of policies includes the managed and inline policies
         that are attached to the user directly. The list  also  includes  any
         additional managed and inline policies that are attached to the group
         to which the user belongs.

       o Group  The list of policies includes  only  the  managed  and  inline
         policies  that  are attached to the group directly. Policies that are
         attached to the groups user are not included.

       o Role  The list of policies includes only the managed and inline poli-
         cies that are attached to the role.

       For  each  managed  policy,  this  operation returns the ARN and policy
       name. For each inline policy, it returns the policy name and the entity
       to  which  it is attached. Inline policies do not have an ARN. For more
       information about these policy types, see Managed policies  and  inline
       policies in the IAM User Guide .

       Policies that are attached to users and roles as permissions boundaries
       are not returned. To view which managed policy is currently used to set
       the  permissions boundary for a user or role, use the  GetUser or  Get-
       Role operations.

SYNOPSIS
            list-policies-granting-service-access
          [--marker <value>]
          --arn <value>
          --service-namespaces <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --marker (string)
          Use this parameter only when paginating results and only  after  you
          receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it
          to the value of the Marker element in the response that you received
          to indicate where the next call should start.

       --arn (string)
          The  ARN  of  the IAM identity (user, group, or role) whose policies
          you want to list.

       --service-namespaces (list)
          The service namespace for the Amazon  Web  Services  services  whose
          policies you want to list.

          To   learn  the  service  namespace  for  a  service,  see  Actions,
          resources, and condition keys for Amazon Web  Services  services  in
          the  IAM User Guide . Choose the name of the service to view details
          for that service. In the first paragraph, find the  service  prefix.
          For example, (service prefix: a4b) . For more information about ser-
          vice namespaces, see Amazon Web Services service namespaces  in  the
          Amazon Web Services General Reference .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To  list  the  policies  that grant a principal access to the specified
       service

       The following list-policies-granting-service-access  example  retrieves
       the  list of policies that grant the IAM user sofia access to AWS Code-
       Commit service.

          aws iam list-policies-granting-service-access \
              --arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/sofia \
              --service-namespaces codecommit

       Output:

          {
              "PoliciesGrantingServiceAccess": [
                  {
                      "ServiceNamespace": "codecommit",
                      "Policies": [
                          {
                              "PolicyName": "Grant-Sofia-Access-To-CodeCommit",
                              "PolicyType": "INLINE",
                              "EntityType": "USER",
                              "EntityName": "sofia"
                          }
                      ]
                  }
              ],
              "IsTruncated": false
          }

       PoliciesGrantingServiceAccess -> (list)
          A  ListPoliciesGrantingServiceAccess  object  that  contains details
          about the permissions policies attached to  the  specified  identity
          (user, group, or role).

          (structure)
              Contains   details  about  the  permissions  policies  that  are
              attached to the specified identity (user, group, or role).

              This data type is used as a response element in  the   ListPoli-

                 To  learn  the  service  namespace of a service, see Actions,
                 resources, and condition keys for Amazon  Web  Services  ser-
                 vices  in  the  Service  Authorization Reference . Choose the
                 name of the service to view details for that service. In  the
                 first  paragraph, find the service prefix. For example, (ser-
                 vice prefix: a4b) . For more information about service names-
                 paces, see Amazon Web Services service namespaces in the Ama-

                     PolicyName -> (string)
                        The policy name.

                     PolicyType -> (string)
                        The policy type. For more information about these pol-
                        icy types, see Managed policies and inline policies in
                        the IAM User Guide .

                     PolicyArn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN). ARNs are unique  iden-
                        tifiers for Amazon Web Services resources.

                        For more information about ARNs, go to Amazon Resource
                        Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Refer-
                        ence .

                     EntityType -> (string)
                        The type of entity (user or role) that used the policy
                        to access the service to which the  inline  policy  is
                        attached.

                        This  field  is  null  for  managed policies. For more
                        information about  these  policy  types,  see  Managed
                        policies and inline policies in the IAM User Guide .

                     EntityName -> (string)
                        The  name  of  the  entity (user or role) to which the
                        inline policy is attached.

                        This field is null  for  managed  policies.  For  more
                        information  about  these  policy  types,  see Managed
                        policies and inline policies in the IAM User Guide .

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether there are more  items  to  return.  If
          your  results  were  truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination
          request using the Marker request parameter to retrieve  more  items.
          We  recommend  that you check IsTruncated after every call to ensure
          that you receive all your results.

       Marker -> (string)
          When IsTruncated is true , this element is present and contains  the
          value  to  use  for  the Marker parameter in a subsequent pagination
          request.
