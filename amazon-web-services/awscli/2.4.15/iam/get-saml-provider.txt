GET-SAML-PROVIDER()                                        GET-SAML-PROVIDER()



NAME
       get-saml-provider -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  SAML provider metadocument that was uploaded when the IAM
       SAML provider resource object was created or updated.

       NOTE:
          This operation requires Signature Version 4 .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-saml-provider
          --saml-provider-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --saml-provider-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SAML provider resource  object
          in IAM to get information about.

          For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in
          the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve the SAML provider metadocument

       This example retrieves the details about the SAML  2.0  provider  whose
       ARM  is arn:aws:iam::123456789012:saml-provider/SAMLADFS.  The response
       includes the metadata document that you got from the identity  provider
       to  create  the  AWS  SAML  provider entity as well as the creation and
       expiration dates:

          aws iam get-saml-provider --saml-provider-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:saml-provider/SAMLADFS

       For more information, see Using SAML Providers in the Using IAM  guide.

OUTPUT
       SAMLMetadataDocument -> (string)
          The  XML  metadata document that includes information about an iden-
          tity provider.

       CreateDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time when the SAML provider was created.

       ValidUntil -> (timestamp)
          The expiration date and time for the SAML provider.

       Tags -> (list)
          A list of tags that are attached to the specified IAM SAML provider.
          The returned list of tags is sorted by tag key. For more information
          about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in the IAM User Guide .

          (structure)
              A structure that represents user-provided metadata that  can  be
              associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tag-
              ging, see Tagging IAM resources in the IAM User Guide .

              Key -> (string)
                 The key name that can be used to  look  up  or  retrieve  the
                 associated  value. For example, Department or Cost Center are
                 common choices.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with  a
                 key  name  of  Department  could  have  values  such as Human
                 Resources , Accounting , and Support . Tags with a  key  name
                 of  Cost  Center might have values that consist of the number
                 associated with the different cost centers in  your  company.
                 Typically,  many  resources  have tags with the same key name
                 but with different values.

                 NOTE:
                     Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag Value as  a
                     single  string.  If  you  need to store an array, you can
                     store comma-separated values in the string. However,  you
                     must interpret the value in your code.
