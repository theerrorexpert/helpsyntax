LIST-SERVICE-SPECIFIC-CREDENTIALS()        LIST-SERVICE-SPECIFIC-CREDENTIALS()



NAME
       list-service-specific-credentials -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about the service-specific credentials associated
       with the specified IAM user. If none exists, the operation  returns  an
       empty list. The service-specific credentials returned by this operation
       are used only for authenticating the IAM user to  a  specific  service.
       For  more  information  about  using  service-specific  credentials  to
       authenticate to an Amazon Web Services service, see Set up service-spe-
       cific credentials in the CodeCommit User Guide.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-service-specific-credentials
          [--user-name <value>]
          [--service-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  user whose service-specific credentials you want
          information about. If this value is not specified, then  the  opera-
          tion  assumes the user whose credentials are used to call the opera-
          tion.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  upper  and lowercase alphanumeric characters
          with no spaces. You can also include any of  the  following  charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --service-name (string)
          Filters  the returned results to only those for the specified Amazon
          Web Services service. If not specified,  then  Amazon  Web  Services
          returns service-specific credentials for all services.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve a list of credentials

       The  following list-service-specific-credentials example lists the cre-
       dentials generated for HTTPS access to AWS CodeCommit repositories  for
       a user named developer.

          aws iam list-service-specific-credentials \
              --user-name developer \
              --service-name codecommit.amazonaws.com

       Output:

          {
              "ServiceSpecificCredentials": [
                  {

                      "ServiceName": "codecommit.amazonaws.com"
                  },
                  {
                      "UserName": "developer",
                      "Status": "Active",
                      "ServiceUserName": "developer+1-at-123456789012",
                      "CreateDate": "2019-10-01T04:31:45Z",
                      "ServiceSpecificCredentialId": "ACCAQFOXMPL6VW57M7AJP",
                      "ServiceName": "codecommit.amazonaws.com"

       ServiceSpecificCredentials -> (list)
