SYNOPSIS
            create-role
          [--path <value>]
          --role-name <value>
          --assume-role-policy-document <value>
          [--description <value>]
          [--max-session-duration <value>]
          [--permissions-boundary <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --path (string)
          The path to the role. For more  information  about  paths,  see  IAM
          Identifiers in the IAM User Guide .

          This  parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a
          slash (/).

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  either  a  forward  slash (/) by itself or a
          string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it
          can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021 ) through the DEL
          character (\u007F ), including most punctuation characters,  digits,
          and upper and lowercased letters.

       --role-name (string)
          The name of the role to create.

          IAM  user,  group,  role, and policy names must be unique within the
          account. Names are not distinguished by case. For example, you  can-
          not create resources named both "MyResource" and "myresource".

       --assume-role-policy-document (string)
          The trust relationship policy document that grants an entity permis-
          sion to assume the role.

          In IAM, you must provide a JSON policy that has been converted to  a
          string. However, for CloudFormation templates formatted in YAML, you
          can provide the policy in JSON or YAML format. CloudFormation always
          converts a YAML policy to JSON format before submitting it to IAM.

          The  regex  pattern  used  to validate this parameter is a string of
          characters consisting of the following:

          o Any printable ASCII character ranging  from  the  space  character
            (\u0020 ) through the end of the ASCII character range

          o The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement
            character set (through \u00FF )

          o The special characters tab (\u0009 ), line  feed  (\u000A  ),  and
            carriage return (\u000D )

          Upon  success,  the  response includes the same trust policy in JSON
          format.

       --description (string)
          A description of the role.

       --max-session-duration (integer)
          The maximum session duration (in seconds) that you want to  set  for
          the  specified role. If you do not specify a value for this setting,
          the default maximum of one hour is applied. This setting can have  a
          value from 1 hour to 12 hours.

          Anyone who assumes the role from the or API can use the DurationSec-
          onds API parameter or the duration-seconds CLI parameter to  request
          a longer session. The MaxSessionDuration setting determines the max-
          imum duration that can be requested using the DurationSeconds param-
          eter. If users don't specify a value for the DurationSeconds parame-
          ter, their security credentials are valid for one hour  by  default.
          This  applies  when  you  use  the AssumeRole* API operations or the
          assume-role* CLI operations but does not apply when  you  use  those
          operations  to create a console URL. For more information, see Using
          IAM roles in the IAM User Guide .

       --permissions-boundary (string)
          The ARN of the policy that is used to set the  permissions  boundary
          for the role.

       --tags (list)
          A  list  of  tags  that you want to attach to the new role. Each tag
          consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information
          about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in the IAM User Guide .

          NOTE:
              If  any  one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed
              maximum number of tags, then the entire request  fails  and  the
              resource is not created.

          (structure)
              A  structure  that represents user-provided metadata that can be
              associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tag-
              ging, see Tagging IAM resources in the IAM User Guide .

              Key -> (string)
                 The  key  name  that  can  be used to look up or retrieve the
                 associated value. For example, Department or Cost Center  are
                 common choices.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a
                 key name of  Department  could  have  values  such  as  Human
                 Resources  ,  Accounting , and Support . Tags with a key name
                 of Cost Center might have values that consist of  the  number
                 associated  with  the different cost centers in your company.
                 Typically, many resources have tags with the  same  key  name
                 but with different values.

                 NOTE:
                     Amazon  Web Services always interprets the tag Value as a
                     single string. If you need to store  an  array,  you  can
                     store  comma-separated values in the string. However, you
                     must interpret the value in your code.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create an IAM role

       The following create-role command creates a role  named  Test-Role  and
       attaches a trust policy to it:

          aws iam create-role --role-name Test-Role --assume-role-policy-document file://Test-Role-Trust-Policy.json

       Output:

          {
            "Role": {
                "AssumeRolePolicyDocument": "<URL-encoded-JSON>",
                "RoleId": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
                "CreateDate": "2013-06-07T20:43:32.821Z",
                "RoleName": "Test-Role",
                "Path": "/",
                "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/Test-Role"
            }
          }

       The   trust   policy   is   defined   as   a   JSON   document  in  the
       Test-Role-Trust-Policy.json file. (The file name and extension  do  not
       have significance.) The trust policy must specify a principal.

       To  attach a permissions policy to a role, use the put-role-policy com-
       mand.

              (structure)
                 A structure that represents user-provided metadata  that  can
                 be  associated  with  an  IAM  resource. For more information
                 about tagging, see Tagging IAM  resources  in  the  IAM  User
                 Guide .

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the
                     associated value. For example, Department or Cost  Center
                     are common choices.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  value  associated  with  this tag. For example, tags
                     with a key name of Department could have values  such  as
                     Human  Resources , Accounting , and Support . Tags with a
                     key name of Cost Center might have values that consist of
                     the  number associated with the different cost centers in
                     your company. Typically, many resources  have  tags  with
                     the same key name but with different values.

                     NOTE:
                        Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag Value as
                        a single string. If you need to store  an  array,  you
                        can  store  comma-separated values in the string. How-
                        ever, you must interpret the value in your code.

          RoleLastUsed -> (structure)
              Contains information about the last time that an  IAM  role  was
              used.  This  includes  the date and time and the Region in which
              the role was last used. Activity is only reported for the trail-
              ing  400  days.  This period can be shorter if your Region began
              supporting these features within the last year. The  role  might
              have been used more than 400 days ago. For more information, see
              Regions where data is tracked in the IAM User Guide .

              LastUsedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format that the role
                 was last used.

                 This  field  is null if the role has not been used within the
                 IAM tracking period. For more information about the  tracking
                 period,  see  Regions  where  data is tracked in the IAM User
                 Guide .

              Region -> (string)
