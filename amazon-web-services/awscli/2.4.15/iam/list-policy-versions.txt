LIST-POLICY-VERSIONS()                                  LIST-POLICY-VERSIONS()



NAME
       list-policy-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  information  about the versions of the specified managed policy,
       including the version that is currently set  as  the  policy's  default
       version.

       For  more  information about managed policies, see Managed policies and
       inline policies in the IAM User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-policy-versions is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Versions

SYNOPSIS
            list-policy-versions
          --policy-arn <value>
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --policy-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM policy for which you want
          the versions.

          For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in
          the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list information about the versions of the specified managed policy

       This example returns the list of available versions of the policy whose
       ARN is arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/MySamplePolicy:

          aws iam list-policy-versions --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/MySamplePolicy

       Output:

          {
            "IsTruncated": false,
            "Versions": [
              {
                "CreateDate": "2015-06-02T23:19:44Z",
                "VersionId": "v2",
                "IsDefaultVersion": true
              },
              {
                "CreateDate": "2015-06-02T22:30:47Z",
                "VersionId": "v1",
                "IsDefaultVersion": false
              }
            ]
          }

       guide.

OUTPUT
       Versions -> (list)
          A list of policy versions.

          For more information about managed policy versions,  see  Versioning
          for managed policies in the IAM User Guide .

          (structure)
              Contains information about a version of a managed policy.

              This data type is used as a response element in the  CreatePoli-
              cyVersion  ,   GetPolicyVersion  ,   ListPolicyVersions  ,   and
              GetAccountAuthorizationDetails operations.

              For  more  information  about managed policies, refer to Managed
              policies and inline policies in the IAM User Guide .

              Document -> (string)
                 The policy document.

                 The policy document is returned in the response to the   Get-
                 PolicyVersion and  GetAccountAuthorizationDetails operations.
                 It is not returned in the response to  the   CreatePolicyVer-
                 sion or  ListPolicyVersions operations.

                 The policy document returned in this structure is URL-encoded
                 compliant with RFC 3986 . You can use a URL  decoding  method
                 to  convert  the policy back to plain JSON text. For example,
                 if you use Java,  you  can  use  the  decode  method  of  the
                 java.net.URLDecoder utility class in the Java SDK. Other lan-
                 guages and SDKs provide similar functionality.

              VersionId -> (string)
                 The identifier for the policy version.

                 Policy version identifiers always begin with v (always lower-
                 case).  When a policy is created, the first policy version is
                 v1 .

              IsDefaultVersion -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether the policy version is set as  the  policy's
                 default version.

              CreateDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time, in ISO 8601 date-time format , when the
                 policy version was created.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether there are more  items  to  return.  If
          your  results  were  truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination
          request using the Marker request parameter to retrieve  more  items.
          Note that IAM might return fewer than the MaxItems number of results
          even when there are more results available. We  recommend  that  you
          check  IsTruncated  after  every call to ensure that you receive all
          your results.

       Marker -> (string)
          When IsTruncated is true , this element is present and contains  the
          value  to  use  for  the Marker parameter in a subsequent pagination
          request.
