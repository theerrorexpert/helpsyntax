NAME
       update-login-profile -

DESCRIPTION
       Changes  the  password for the specified IAM user. You can use the CLI,
       the Amazon Web Services API, or the Users page in the  IAM  console  to
       change  the  password  for  any IAM user. Use  ChangePassword to change
       your own password in the My Security Credentials page in the Amazon Web
       Services Management Console.

       For  more information about modifying passwords, see Managing passwords
       in the IAM User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-login-profile
          --user-name <value>
          [--password <value>]
          [--password-reset-required | --no-password-reset-required]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-name (string)
          The name of the user whose password you want to update.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  upper  and lowercase alphanumeric characters
          with no spaces. You can also include any of  the  following  charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --password (string)
          The new password for the specified IAM user.

          The  regex  pattern  used  to validate this parameter is a string of
          characters consisting of the following:

          o Any printable ASCII character ranging  from  the  space  character
            (\u0020 ) through the end of the ASCII character range

          o The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement
            character set (through \u00FF )

          o The special characters tab (\u0009 ), line  feed  (\u000A  ),  and
            carriage return (\u000D )

          However,  the format can be further restricted by the account admin-
          istrator by setting a password policy on  the  Amazon  Web  Services
          account. For more information, see  UpdateAccountPasswordPolicy .

       --password-reset-required | --no-password-reset-required (boolean)
          Allows this new password to be used only once by requiring the spec-
          ified IAM user to set a new password on next sign-in.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update the password for an IAM user

       The following update-login-profile command creates a new  password  for
       the IAM user named Bob:

          aws iam update-login-profile --user-name Bob --password <password>

       To  set a password policy for the account, use the update-account-pass-
       word-policy command. If the new password violates the account  password
       policy, the command returns a PasswordPolicyViolation error.

       If  the  account  password  policy allows them to, IAM users can change
       their own passwords using the change-password command.

       Store the password in a secure place. If the password is lost, it  can-
       not  be  recovered,  and  you  must  create  a  new  one using the cre-
       ate-login-profile command.

       For more information, see Managing Passwords in the Using IAM guide.

OUTPUT
       None
