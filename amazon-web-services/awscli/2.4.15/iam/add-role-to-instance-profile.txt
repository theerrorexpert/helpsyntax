ADD-ROLE-TO-INSTANCE-PROFILE()                  ADD-ROLE-TO-INSTANCE-PROFILE()



NAME
       add-role-to-instance-profile -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  the  specified  IAM  role  to  the specified instance profile. An
       instance profile can contain only one role, and this  quota  cannot  be
       increased.  You  can  remove the existing role and then add a different
       role to an instance profile. You must  then  wait  for  the  change  to
       appear  across  all  of Amazon Web Services because of eventual consis-
       tency . To force the change, you must disassociate the instance profile
       and then associate the instance profile , or you can stop your instance
       and then restart it.

       NOTE:
          The caller of this operation must be granted the PassRole permission
          on the IAM role by a permissions policy.

       For  more  information  about  roles, see Working with roles . For more
       information about instance profiles, see About instance profiles .

SYNOPSIS
            add-role-to-instance-profile
          --instance-profile-name <value>
          --role-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-profile-name (string)
          The name of the instance profile to update.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  upper  and lowercase alphanumeric characters
          with no spaces. You can also include any of  the  following  charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --role-name (string)
          The name of the role to add.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To add a role to an instance profile

       The following add-role-to-instance-profile command adds the role  named
       S3Access to the instance profile named Webserver:

          aws iam add-role-to-instance-profile --role-name S3Access --instance-profile-name Webserver

       To create an instance profile, use the create-instance-profile command.

OUTPUT
