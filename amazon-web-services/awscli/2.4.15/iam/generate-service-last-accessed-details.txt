GENERATE-SERVICE-LAST-ACCESSED-DETAILSGENERATE-SERVICE-LAST-ACCESSED-DETAILS()



NAME
       generate-service-last-accessed-details -

DESCRIPTION
       Generates  a  report  that  includes details about when an IAM resource
       (user, group, role, or policy) was last used in an  attempt  to  access
       Amazon  Web  Services  services. Recent activity usually appears within
       four hours. IAM reports activity for the last 365 days, or less if your
       Region  began  supporting  this  feature within the last year. For more
       information, see Regions where data is tracked .

       WARNING:
          The service last accessed data includes all attempts  to  access  an
          Amazon Web Services API, not just the successful ones. This includes
          all attempts that were made using the Amazon Web Services Management
          Console, the Amazon Web Services API through any of the SDKs, or any
          of the command line tools. An unexpected entry in the  service  last
          accessed  data does not mean that your account has been compromised,
          because the request might have been denied. Refer to your CloudTrail
          logs as the authoritative source for information about all API calls
          and whether they were successful or denied access. For more informa-
          tion, see Logging IAM events with CloudTrail in the IAM User Guide .

       The GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails operation returns a JobId .  Use
       this  parameter  in  the following operations to retrieve the following
       details from your report:

       o GetServiceLastAccessedDetails  Use this operation for users,  groups,
         roles, or policies to list every Amazon Web Services service that the
         resource could access using permissions policies. For  each  service,
         the  response  includes  information  about  the  most  recent access
         attempt. The JobId returned by GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetail must
         be  used  by the same role within a session, or by the same user when
         used to call GetServiceLastAccessedDetail .

       o GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities   Use  this  operation  for
         groups and policies to list information about the associated entities
         (users or roles) that attempted to access a specific Amazon Web  Ser-
         vices service.

       To  check the status of the GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails request,
       use the JobId parameter in the same operations and test  the  JobStatus
       response parameter.

       For additional information about the permissions policies that allow an
       identity (user, group, or role) to access specific  services,  use  the
       ListPoliciesGrantingServiceAccess operation.

       NOTE:
          Service  last  accessed  data  does  not use other policy types when
          determining whether a resource could access a service.  These  other
          policy  types include resource-based policies, access control lists,
          Organizations policies, IAM permissions boundaries, and  STS  assume
          role  policies.  It  only applies permissions policy logic. For more
          about the evaluation of policy types, see Evaluating policies in the
          IAM User Guide .

       For  more  information about service and action last accessed data, see
       Reducing permissions using service last accessed data in the  IAM  User
       Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            generate-service-last-accessed-details
          --arn <value>
          [--granularity <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The  ARN  of the IAM resource (user, group, role, or managed policy)
          used to generate information about when the resource was  last  used
          in an attempt to access an Amazon Web Services service.

       --granularity (string)
          The  level  of  detail  that  you  want to generate. You can specify
          whether you want to generate information about the last  attempt  to
          access  services  or actions. If you specify service-level granular-
          ity, this operation generates only  service  data.  If  you  specify
          action-level  granularity,  it generates service and action data. If
          you don't include this optional parameter, the  operation  generates
          service data.

          Possible values:

          o SERVICE_LEVEL

          o ACTION_LEVEL

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To generate a service access report

       The  following  generate-service-last-accessed-details example starts a
       background job to generate a report that lists the services accessed by
       IAM  users  and other entities with a custom policy named intern-bound-
       ary. You can display the report after it  is  created  by  running  the
       get-service-last-accessed-details command.

          aws iam generate-service-last-accessed-details \
              --arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/intern-boundary

       Output:

          {
              "JobId": "2eb6c2b8-7b4c-3xmp-3c13-03b72c8cdfdc"
          }

       The  following  generate-service-last-accessed-details example starts a
       background job to generate a report that lists the services accessed by
       IAM  users  and other entities with the AWS managed AdministratorAccess
       policy. You can display the report after it is created by  running  the
       get-service-last-accessed-details command.:

          aws iam generate-service-last-accessed-details \
              --arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess

       Output:

          {
              "JobId": "78b6c2ba-d09e-6xmp-7039-ecde30b26916"
          }

OUTPUT
       JobId -> (string)
          The  JobId that you can use in the  GetServiceLastAccessedDetails or
          GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities  operations.   The   JobId
          returned  by  GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetail  must be used by the
          same role within a session, or by the same user when  used  to  call
          GetServiceLastAccessedDetail .
