GET-ORGANIZATIONS-ACCESS-REPORT()            GET-ORGANIZATIONS-ACCESS-REPORT()



NAME
       get-organizations-access-report -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the service last accessed data report for Organizations that
       was previously generated using the  ``   GenerateOrganizationsAccessRe-
       port  ``  operation. This operation retrieves the status of your report
       job and the report contents.

       Depending on the parameters that you  passed  when  you  generated  the
       report,  the  data  returned  could  include different information. For
       details, see  GenerateOrganizationsAccessReport .

       To call this operation, you must be signed in to the management account
       in  your organization. SCPs must be enabled for your organization root.
       You must have permissions to perform this operation. For more  informa-
       tion,  see Refining permissions using service last accessed data in the
       IAM User Guide .

       For each service that principals in an account (root users, IAM  users,
       or  IAM  roles)  could access using SCPs, the operation returns details
       about the most recent access attempt. If there was no attempt, the ser-
       vice  is listed without details about the most recent attempt to access
       the service. If the operation fails, it  returns  the  reason  that  it
       failed.

       By default, the list is sorted by service namespace.

SYNOPSIS
            get-organizations-access-report
          --job-id <value>
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--marker <value>]
          [--sort-key <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the request generated by the  GenerateOrganiza-
          tionsAccessReport operation.

       --max-items (integer)
          Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number
          of  items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond
          the maximum you specify, the IsTruncated response element is true  .

          If  you  do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults
          to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results,  even  when  there
          are  more  results available. In that case, the IsTruncated response
          element returns true , and Marker contains a value to include in the
          subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

       --marker (string)
          Use  this  parameter only when paginating results and only after you
          receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it
          to the value of the Marker element in the response that you received
          to indicate where the next call should start.

       --sort-key (string)
          The key that is used to sort the results. If you choose  the  names-
          pace  key,  the  results  are returned in alphabetical order. If you
          choose the time key, the results are sorted numerically by the  date
          and time.

          Possible values:

          o SERVICE_NAMESPACE_ASCENDING

          o SERVICE_NAMESPACE_DESCENDING

          o LAST_AUTHENTICATED_TIME_ASCENDING

          o LAST_AUTHENTICATED_TIME_DESCENDING

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve an access report

       The following get-organizations-access-report example displays a previ-
       ously generated access report for an AWS Organizations entity. To  gen-
       erate a report, use the generate-organizations-access-report command.

          aws iam get-organizations-access-report \
              --job-id a8b6c06f-aaa4-8xmp-28bc-81da71836359

       Output:

          not attempt to access.

       AccessDetails -> (list)
          An object that contains details about the  most  recent  attempt  to
          access the service.

          (structure)
              An  object  that  contains details about when a principal in the
              reported Organizations entity last attempted to access an Amazon
              Web  Services  service.  A  principal can be an IAM user, an IAM
              role, or the Amazon Web Services account root  user  within  the
              reported Organizations entity.

              This data type is a response element in the  GetOrganizationsAc-
              cessReport operation.

              ServiceName -> (string)
                 The name of the service in which access was attempted.

              ServiceNamespace -> (string)
                 The namespace of the service in which access was attempted.

                 To learn the service namespace of  a  service,  see  Actions,
                 resources,  and  condition  keys for Amazon Web Services ser-
                 vices in the Service Authorization  Reference  .  Choose  the
                 name  of the service to view details for that service. In the
                 first paragraph, find the service prefix. For example,  (ser-
                 vice prefix: a4b) . For more information about service names-
                 paces, see Amazon Web Services service namespaces in the Ama-
                 zon Web Services General Reference .

              Region -> (string)
                 The Region where the last service access attempt occurred.

                 This field is null if no principals in the reported Organiza-
                 tions entity attempted  to  access  the  service  within  the
                 reporting period .

              EntityPath -> (string)
                 The  path  of  the Organizations entity (root, organizational
                 unit, or account) from which an authenticated principal  last
                 attempted to access the service. Amazon Web Services does not
                 report unauthenticated requests.

                 This field is null if no principals (IAM users, IAM roles, or
                 root users) in the reported Organizations entity attempted to
                 access the service within the reporting period .

              LastAuthenticatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time  format  ,  when  an
                 authenticated principal most recently attempted to access the
                 service. Amazon Web Services does not report  unauthenticated
                 requests.

                 This field is null if no principals in the reported Organiza-
                 tions entity attempted  to  access  the  service  within  the
                 reporting period .

              TotalAuthenticatedEntities -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  accounts with authenticated principals (root
                 users, IAM users, and IAM roles) that attempted to access the
                 service in the reporting period.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A  flag  that  indicates  whether there are more items to return. If
          your results were truncated, you can make  a  subsequent  pagination
          request  using  the Marker request parameter to retrieve more items.
          Note that IAM might return fewer than the MaxItems number of results
          even  when  there  are more results available. We recommend that you
          check IsTruncated after every call to ensure that  you  receive  all
          your results.

       Marker -> (string)
          When  IsTruncated is true , this element is present and contains the
          value to use for the Marker parameter  in  a  subsequent  pagination
          request.

       ErrorDetails -> (structure)
          Contains information about the reason that the operation failed.

          This  data  type  is used as a response element in the  GetOrganiza-
          tionsAccessReport ,  GetServiceLastAccessedDetails  ,  and   GetSer-
          viceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities operations.

          Message -> (string)
              Detailed information about the reason that the operation failed.

          Code -> (string)
              The error code associated with the operation failure.
