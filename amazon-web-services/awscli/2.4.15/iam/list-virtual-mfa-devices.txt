LIST-VIRTUAL-MFA-DEVICES()                          LIST-VIRTUAL-MFA-DEVICES()



NAME
       list-virtual-mfa-devices -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  virtual  MFA  devices  defined  in  the Amazon Web Services
       account by assignment status. If you do not specify an assignment  sta-
       tus,  the  operation returns a list of all virtual MFA devices. Assign-
       ment status can be Assigned , Unassigned , or Any .

       NOTE:
          IAM resource-listing operations return a  subset  of  the  available
          attributes  for  the  resource. For example, this operation does not
          return tags, even though they  are  an  attribute  of  the  returned
          object. To view all of the information for a virtual MFA device, see
          ListVirtualMFADevices .

       You can paginate the results using the MaxItems and Marker  parameters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-virtual-mfa-devices  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: VirtualMFADevices

SYNOPSIS
            list-virtual-mfa-devices
          [--assignment-status <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --assignment-status (string)
          The status (Unassigned or Assigned ) of the devices to list. If  you
          do not specify an AssignmentStatus , the operation defaults to Any ,
          which lists both assigned and unassigned virtual MFA devices.,

          Possible values:

          o Assigned

          o Unassigned

          o Any

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list virtual MFA devices

       The  following  list-virtual-mfa-devices  command lists the virtual MFA
       devices that have been configured for the current account:

          aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices

       Output:

          {
            "VirtualMFADevices": [
              {
                "SerialNumber": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/ExampleMFADevice"
              },
              {
                "SerialNumber": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/Fred"
              }
            ]
          }

                 tualMFADeviceName  is  one  of  the  create  call  arguments.
                 AccountName is the user name if set (otherwise,  the  account
                 ID otherwise), and Base32String is the seed in base32 format.
                 The Base32String value is base64-encoded.

              User -> (structure)
                 The IAM user associated with this virtual MFA device.

                 Path -> (string)
                     The path to the user. For more information  about  paths,
                     see IAM identifiers in the IAM User Guide .

                     The  ARN of the policy used to set the permissions bound-
                     ary for the user.

                 UserName -> (string)
                     The friendly name identifying the user.

                 UserId -> (string)
                     The stable and unique string identifying  the  user.  For
                     more  information  about  IDs, see IAM identifiers in the
                     IAM User Guide .

                 Arn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the  user.
                     For  more  information  about ARNs and how to use ARNs in
                     policies, see IAM Identifiers in the IAM User Guide .

                 CreateDate -> (timestamp)
                     The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time  format  ,  when
                     the user was created.

                 PasswordLastUsed -> (timestamp)
                     The  date  and  time, in ISO 8601 date-time format , when
                     the user's password was last used to sign in to an Amazon
                     Web  Services  website. For a list of Amazon Web Services
                     websites that capture a user's last sign-in time, see the
                     Credential  reports  topic  in  the IAM User Guide . If a
                     password is used more than once in  a  five-minute  span,
                     only  the  first  use  is  returned in this field. If the
                     field is null (no value), then  it  indicates  that  they
                     never signed in with a password. This can be because:

                     o The user never had a password.

                     o A  password  exists  but  has  not  been used since IAM
                       started tracking this information on October 20,  2014.

                     A  null  value  does  not  mean that the user never had a
                     password. Also, if the user does  not  currently  have  a
                     password  but  had  one in the past, then this field con-
                     tains the date and time  the  most  recent  password  was
                     used.

                     This  value  is  returned  only in the  GetUser and  Lis-
                     tUsers operations.

                 PermissionsBoundary -> (structure)
                     For more information about  permissions  boundaries,  see
                     Permissions boundaries for IAM identities in the IAM User
                     Guide .

                     PermissionsBoundaryType -> (string)
                        The permissions boundary  usage  type  that  indicates
                        what  type  of IAM resource is used as the permissions
                        boundary for an entity. This data type can only have a
                        value of Policy .

                     PermissionsBoundaryArn -> (string)
                        The  ARN  of  the  policy  used to set the permissions
                        boundary for the user or role.

                 Tags -> (list)
                     A list of tags that are associated  with  the  user.  For
                     more information about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources
                     in the IAM User Guide .

                     (structure)
                        A structure  that  represents  user-provided  metadata
                        that  can be associated with an IAM resource. For more
                        information about tagging, see Tagging  IAM  resources
                        in the IAM User Guide .

                        Key -> (string)
                            The  key  name  that  can  be  used  to look up or
                            retrieve  the  associated  value.   For   example,
                            Department or Cost Center are common choices.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  value  associated with this tag. For example,
                            tags with a key name of Department could have val-
                            ues  such  as  Human  Resources , Accounting , and
                            Support . Tags with a  key  name  of  Cost  Center
                            might have values that consist of the number asso-
                            ciated with the different  cost  centers  in  your
                            company.  Typically, many resources have tags with
                            the same key name but with different values.

                            NOTE:
                               Amazon Web Services always interprets  the  tag
                               Value  as a single string. If you need to store
                               an array, you can store comma-separated  values
                               in  the string. However, you must interpret the
                               value in your code.

              EnableDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and  time  on  which  the  virtual  MFA  device  was
                 enabled.

              Tags -> (list)
                 A  list  of tags that are attached to the virtual MFA device.
                 For more information about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources
                 in the IAM User Guide .

                 (structure)
                     A  structure  that represents user-provided metadata that
                     can be associated with an IAM resource. For more informa-
                     tion  about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in the IAM
                     User Guide .

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key name that can be used to look up  or  retrieve
                        the  associated value. For example, Department or Cost
                        Center are common choices.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value associated with this tag. For example,  tags
                        with  a  key name of Department could have values such
                        as Human Resources , Accounting , and Support  .  Tags
                        with  a key name of Cost Center might have values that
                        consist of the number associated  with  the  different
                        cost   centers   in   your  company.  Typically,  many
                        resources have tags with the same key  name  but  with
                        different values.

                        NOTE:
                            Amazon  Web  Services  always  interprets  the tag
                            Value as a single string. If you need to store  an
                            array, you can store comma-separated values in the
                            string. However, you must interpret the  value  in
                            your code.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A  flag  that  indicates  whether there are more items to return. If
          your results were truncated, you can make  a  subsequent  pagination
          request  using  the Marker request parameter to retrieve more items.
          Note that IAM might return fewer than the MaxItems number of results
          even  when  there  are more results available. We recommend that you
          check IsTruncated after every call to ensure that  you  receive  all
          your results.

       Marker -> (string)
          When  IsTruncated is true , this element is present and contains the
          value to use for the Marker parameter  in  a  subsequent  pagination
          request.
