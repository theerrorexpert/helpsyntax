UPDATE-SIGNING-CERTIFICATE()                      UPDATE-SIGNING-CERTIFICATE()



NAME
       update-signing-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Changes  the  status  of  the  specified  user signing certificate from
       active to disabled, or vice versa. This operation can be used  to  dis-
       able  an  IAM user's signing certificate as part of a certificate rota-
       tion work flow.

       If the UserName field is not specified, the  user  name  is  determined
       implicitly  based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID used to sign
       the request. This operation works for access keys under the Amazon  Web
       Services  account.  Consequently,  you can use this operation to manage
       Amazon Web Services account root user credentials even  if  the  Amazon
       Web Services account has no associated users.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-signing-certificate
          [--user-name <value>]
          --certificate-id <value>
          --status <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-name (string)
          The name of the IAM user the signing certificate belongs to.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters consisting of upper  and  lowercase  alphanumeric  characters
          with  no  spaces.  You can also include any of the following charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --certificate-id (string)
          The ID of the signing certificate you want to update.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  that can consist of any upper or lowercased letter or digit.

       --status (string)
          The status you want to assign to the certificate. Active means  that
          the  certificate  can  be  used for programmatic calls to Amazon Web
          Services Inactive means that the certificate cannot be used.

          Possible values:

          o Active

          o Inactive

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To activate or deactivate a signing certificate for an IAM user

       The following update-signing-certificate command deactivates the speci-
       fied signing certificate for the IAM user named Bob:

          aws iam update-signing-certificate --certificate-id TA7SMP42TDN5Z26OBPJE7EXAMPLE --status Inactive --user-name Bob

       To  get the ID for a signing certificate, use the list-signing-certifi-
       cates command.

       For more information, see Creating and Uploading a  User  Signing  Cer-
       tificate in the Using IAM guide.

OUTPUT
       None
