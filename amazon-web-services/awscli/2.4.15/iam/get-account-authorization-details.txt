GET-ACCOUNT-AUTHORIZATION-DETAILS()        GET-ACCOUNT-AUTHORIZATION-DETAILS()



NAME
       get-account-authorization-details -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information about all IAM users, groups, roles, and policies
       in your Amazon Web Services account, including their  relationships  to
       one  another. Use this operation to obtain a snapshot of the configura-
       tion of IAM permissions (users, groups, roles, and  policies)  in  your
       account.

       NOTE:
          Policies  returned  by this operation are URL-encoded compliant with
          RFC 3986 . You can use a URL decoding method to convert  the  policy
          back  to  plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can use
          the decode method of the java.net.URLDecoder utility  class  in  the
          Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality.

       You  can  optionally filter the results using the Filter parameter. You
       can paginate the results using the MaxItems and Marker parameters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-account-authorization-details is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple
       API  calls  may  be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of  the  following  query expressions: UserDetailList, GroupDetailList,
       RoleDetailList, Policies

SYNOPSIS
            get-account-authorization-details
          [--filter <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filter (list)
          A list of entity types used to filter the results. Only the entities
          that match the types you specify are included in the output. Use the
          value LocalManagedPolicy to include customer managed policies.

          The format for this parameter is a  comma-separated  (if  more  than
          one)  list  of strings. Each string value in the list must be one of
          the valid values listed below.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            User
            Role
            Group
            LocalManagedPolicy
            AWSManagedPolicy

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 (structure)
                     A  structure  that represents user-provided metadata that
                     can be associated with an IAM resource. For more informa-
                     tion  about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in the IAM
                     User Guide .

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key name that can be used to look up  or  retrieve
                        the  associated value. For example, Department or Cost
                        Center are common choices.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value associated with this tag. For example,  tags
                        with  a  key name of Department could have values such
                        as Human Resources , Accounting , and Support  .  Tags
                        with  a key name of Cost Center might have values that
                        consist of the number associated  with  the  different
                        cost   centers   in   your  company.  Typically,  many
                        resources have tags with the same key  name  but  with
                        different values.

                        NOTE:
                            Amazon  Web  Services  always  interprets  the tag
                            Value as a single string. If you need to store  an
                            array, you can store comma-separated values in the
                            string. However, you must interpret the  value  in
                            your code.

       GroupDetailList -> (list)
          A list containing information about IAM groups.

                                      many resources have tags with  the  same
                                      key name but with different values.

                                      NOTE:
                                          Amazon  Web  Services  always inter-
                                          prets the  tag  Value  as  a  single
                                          string.  If  you  need  to  store an
                                          array, you can store comma-separated
                                          values  in  the string. However, you
                                          must interpret  the  value  in  your
                                          code.

                            RoleLastUsed -> (structure)

                               an IAM role was used. This  includes  the  date
                               and  time  and the Region in which the role was
                               last used. Activity is only  reported  for  the
                               trailing  400  days. This period can be shorter
                               if your Region began supporting these  features
                               within  the last year. The role might have been
                               used more than 400 days ago. For more  informa-
                               tion,  see Regions where data is tracked in the

                            Value -> (string)
                               The  value  associated with this tag. For exam-
                               ple, tags with a key name of  Department  could
                               have  values such as Human Resources , Account-
                               ing , and Support . Tags with  a  key  name  of
                               Cost  Center  might have values that consist of
                               the number associated with the  different  cost
                               centers   in   your  company.  Typically,  many
                               resources have tags with the same key name  but
                               with different values.

                               NOTE:
                                   Amazon  Web  Services always interprets the
                                   tag Value as a single string. If  you  need
                                   to store an array, you can store comma-sep-
                                   arated values in the string.  However,  you
                                   must interpret the value in your code.

              RolePolicyList -> (list)
                 A  list  of inline policies embedded in the role. These poli-
                 cies are the role's access (permissions) policies.

                     Contains information about an IAM policy,  including  the
                     policy document.

                     This  data  type  is  used  as  a response element in the
                     GetAccountAuthorizationDetails operation.

                     PolicyName -> (string)
                        The name of the policy.

                     PolicyDocument -> (string)
                        The policy document.

              AttachedManagedPolicies -> (list)
                 A list of managed policies attached to the role. These  poli-
                 cies are the role's access (permissions) policies.

                 (structure)
                     Contains information about an attached policy.

                     An  attached  policy  is  a  managed policy that has been
                     attached to a user, group, or role.  This  data  type  is
                     used as a response element in the  ListAttachedGroupPoli-
                     cies ,  ListAttachedRolePolicies ,  ListAttachedUserPoli-
                     cies , and  GetAccountAuthorizationDetails operations.

                     For  more  information  about  managed policies, refer to
                     Managed policies and inline  policies  in  the  IAM  User
                     Guide .

                     PolicyName -> (string)
                        The friendly name of the attached policy.

                     PolicyArn -> (string)
                        The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN). ARNs are unique iden-
                        tifiers for Amazon Web Services resources.

                        For more information about ARNs, go to Amazon Resource
                        Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Refer-
                        ence .

              PermissionsBoundary -> (structure)
                 The ARN of the policy used to set  the  permissions  boundary
                 for the role.

                 For   more  information  about  permissions  boundaries,  see
                 Permissions boundaries for IAM identities  in  the  IAM  User
                 Guide .

                 PermissionsBoundaryType -> (string)
                     The  permissions  boundary usage type that indicates what
                     type of IAM resource is used as the permissions  boundary
                     for  an  entity.  This data type can only have a value of
                     Policy .

                 PermissionsBoundaryArn -> (string)
                     The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions  bound-
                     ary for the user or role.

              Tags -> (list)
                 A list of tags that are attached to the role. For more infor-
                 mation about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources  in  the  IAM
                 User Guide .

                 (structure)
                     A  structure  that represents user-provided metadata that
                     can be associated with an IAM resource. For more informa-
                     tion  about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in the IAM
                     User Guide .

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key name that can be used to look up  or  retrieve
                        the  associated value. For example, Department or Cost
                        Center are common choices.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value associated with this tag. For example,  tags
                        with  a  key name of Department could have values such
                        as Human Resources , Accounting , and Support  .  Tags
                        with  a key name of Cost Center might have values that
                        consist of the number associated  with  the  different
                        cost   centers   in   your  company.  Typically,  many
                        resources have tags with the same key  name  but  with
                        different values.

                        NOTE:
                            Amazon  Web  Services  always  interprets  the tag
                            Value as a single string. If you need to store  an
                            array, you can store comma-separated values in the
                            string. However, you must interpret the  value  in
                            your code.

              RoleLastUsed -> (structure)
                 Contains information about the last time that an IAM role was
                 used. This includes the date and time and the Region in which
                 the  role  was  last  used. Activity is only reported for the
                 trailing 400 days. This period can be shorter if your  Region
                 began  supporting  these  features  within the last year. The
                 role might have been used more than 400 days  ago.  For  more
                 information,  see  Regions  where  data is tracked in the IAM
                 User Guide .

                 LastUsedDate -> (timestamp)
                     The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format that  the
                     role was last used.

                     This  field  is null if the role has not been used within
                     the IAM tracking period. For more information  about  the
                     tracking period, see Regions where data is tracked in the
                     IAM User Guide .

                 Region -> (string)

                     role was last used.

       Policies -> (list)
          A list containing information about managed policies.

          (structure)
              Contains  information about a managed policy, including the pol-
              icy's ARN,  versions,  and  the  number  of  principal  entities
              (users, groups, and roles) that the policy is attached to.

              This  data type is used as a response element in the  GetAccoun-
              tAuthorizationDetails operation.

              For more information about managed policies, see  Managed  poli-
              cies and inline policies in the IAM User Guide .

                 IAM User Guide .

              DefaultVersionId -> (string)
                 The  identifier  for the version of the policy that is set as
                 the default (operative) version.

                 For more information about policy  versions,  see  Versioning
                 for managed policies in the IAM User Guide .

              AttachmentCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of principal entities (users, groups, and roles)

              PermissionsBoundaryUsageCount -> (integer)
                 The number of entities (users and roles) for which the policy
                 is used as the permissions boundary.

                 For   more  information  about  permissions  boundaries,  see
                 Permissions boundaries for IAM identities  in  the  IAM  User
                 Guide .

              IsAttachable -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether the policy can be attached to an IAM user,
                 group, or role.

              Description -> (string)
                 A friendly description of the policy.

              CreateDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format  ,  when  the
                 policy was created.

              UpdateDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time, in ISO 8601 date-time format , when the
                 policy was last updated.

                 When a policy has only one version, this field  contains  the
                 date  and time when the policy was created. When a policy has
                 more than one version, this field contains the date and  time
                 when the most recent policy version was created.

              PolicyVersionList -> (list)
                 A  list containing information about the versions of the pol-
                 icy.

                 (structure)
                     Contains information about a version of a managed policy.

                     This data type is used as a response element in the  Cre-
                     atePolicyVersion ,   GetPolicyVersion  ,   ListPolicyVer-
                     sions , and  GetAccountAuthorizationDetails operations.

                     For  more  information  about  managed policies, refer to
                     Managed policies and inline  policies  in  the  IAM  User
                     Guide .

                     Document -> (string)
                        The policy document.

                        The policy document is returned in the response to the
                        GetPolicyVersion  and   GetAccountAuthorizationDetails
                        operations.  It is not returned in the response to the
                        CreatePolicyVersion or  ListPolicyVersions operations.

                        The  policy  document  returned  in  this structure is
                        URL-encoded compliant with RFC 3986 . You  can  use  a
                        URL  decoding  method  to  convert  the policy back to
                        plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you can
                        use the decode method of the java.net.URLDecoder util-
                        ity class in the Java SDK. Other  languages  and  SDKs
                        provide similar functionality.

                     VersionId -> (string)
                        The identifier for the policy version.

                        Policy version identifiers always begin with v (always
                        lowercase). When a policy is created, the first policy
                        version is v1 .

                     IsDefaultVersion -> (boolean)
                        Specifies  whether  the  policy  version is set as the
                        policy's default version.

                     CreateDate -> (timestamp)
                        The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format , when
                        the policy version was created.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A  flag  that  indicates  whether there are more items to return. If
          your results were truncated, you can make  a  subsequent  pagination
          request  using  the Marker request parameter to retrieve more items.
          Note that IAM might return fewer than the MaxItems number of results
          even  when  there  are more results available. We recommend that you
          check IsTruncated after every call to ensure that  you  receive  all
          your results.

       Marker -> (string)
          When  IsTruncated is true , this element is present and contains the
          value to use for the Marker parameter  in  a  subsequent  pagination
          request.
