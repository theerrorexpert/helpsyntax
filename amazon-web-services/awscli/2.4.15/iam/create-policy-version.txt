CREATE-POLICY-VERSION()                                CREATE-POLICY-VERSION()



NAME
       create-policy-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new version of the specified managed policy. To update a man-
       aged policy, you create a new policy version. A managed policy can have
       up  to  five versions. If the policy has five versions, you must delete
       an existing version using  DeletePolicyVersion before you create a  new
       version.

       Optionally,  you  can  set the new version as the policy's default ver-
       sion. The default version is the version that is in effect for the  IAM
       users, groups, and roles to which the policy is attached.

       For  more information about managed policy versions, see Versioning for
       managed policies in the IAM User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-policy-version
          --policy-arn <value>
          --policy-document <value>
          [--set-as-default | --no-set-as-default]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --policy-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM policy to which  you  want
          to add a new version.

          For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in
          the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

       --policy-document (string)
          The JSON policy document that you want to use  as  the  content  for
          this new version of the policy.

          You must provide policies in JSON format in IAM. However, for Cloud-
          Formation templates formatted in YAML, you can provide the policy in
          JSON or YAML format. CloudFormation always converts a YAML policy to
          JSON format before submitting it to IAM.

          The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in  this
          operation,  including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maxi-
          mum character counts of a managed policy with  no  whitespaces,  see
          IAM and STS character quotas .

          The  regex  pattern  used  to validate this parameter is a string of
          characters consisting of the following:

          o Any printable ASCII character ranging  from  the  space  character
            (\u0020 ) through the end of the ASCII character range

          o The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement
            character set (through \u00FF )

          o The special characters tab (\u0009 ), line  feed  (\u000A  ),  and
            carriage return (\u000D )

       --set-as-default | --no-set-as-default (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  to set this version as the policy's default ver-
          sion.

          When this parameter is true , the new  policy  version  becomes  the
          operative version. That is, it becomes the version that is in effect
          for the IAM users, groups, and roles that the policy is attached to.

          For  more  information about managed policy versions, see Versioning
          for managed policies in the IAM User Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a new version of a managed policy

       This example creates a new v2 version of the IAM policy  whose  ARN  is
       arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/MyPolicy and makes it the default ver-
       sion:

          aws iam create-policy-version --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/MyPolicy --policy-document file://NewPolicyVersion.json --set-as-default

       Output:

          {
              "PolicyVersion": {
                  "CreateDate": "2015-06-16T18:56:03.721Z",
                  "VersionId": "v2",
                  "IsDefaultVersion": true
              }
          }

       For more information, see Versioning for Managed Policies in the  Using
       IAM guide.

OUTPUT
       PolicyVersion -> (structure)
          A structure containing details about the new policy version.

          Document -> (string)
              The policy document.

              The policy document is returned in the response to the  GetPoli-
              cyVersion and  GetAccountAuthorizationDetails operations. It  is
              not  returned  in  the  response  to the  CreatePolicyVersion or
              ListPolicyVersions operations.

              The policy document returned in this  structure  is  URL-encoded
              compliant  with  RFC 3986 . You can use a URL decoding method to
              convert the policy back to plain JSON text. For example, if  you
              use  Java,  you can use the decode method of the java.net.URLDe-
              coder utility class in the Java SDK. Other  languages  and  SDKs
              provide similar functionality.

          VersionId -> (string)
              The identifier for the policy version.

              Policy  version  identifiers  always begin with v (always lower-
              case). When a policy is created, the first policy version is  v1
              .

          IsDefaultVersion -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  the  policy  version  is set as the policy's
              default version.

          CreateDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format , when the  pol-
              icy version was created.
