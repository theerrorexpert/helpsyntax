GET-ACCESS-KEY-LAST-USED()                          GET-ACCESS-KEY-LAST-USED()



NAME
       get-access-key-last-used -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information  about  when  the  specified access key was last
       used. The information includes the date and time  of  last  use,  along
       with  the Amazon Web Services service and Region that were specified in
       the last request made with that key.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-access-key-last-used
          --access-key-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --access-key-id (string)
          The identifier of an access key.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  that can consist of any upper or lowercased letter or digit.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       used

       The  following  example retrieves information about when the access key

       Output:

          {
            "UserName":  "Bob",
            "AccessKeyLastUsed": {
                "Region": "us-east-1",
                "ServiceName": "iam",
                "LastUsedDate": "2015-06-16T22:45:00Z"
