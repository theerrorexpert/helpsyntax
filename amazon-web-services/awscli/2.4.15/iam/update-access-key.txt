UPDATE-ACCESS-KEY()                                        UPDATE-ACCESS-KEY()



NAME
       update-access-key -

DESCRIPTION
       Changes the status of the specified access key from Active to Inactive,
       or vice versa. This operation can be used to disable a  user's  key  as
       part of a key rotation workflow.

       If  the  UserName is not specified, the user name is determined implic-
       itly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID used  to  sign  the
       request. This operation works for access keys under the Amazon Web Ser-
       vices account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage  Ama-
       zon  Web  Services account root user credentials even if the Amazon Web
       Services account has no associated users.

       For information about rotating keys, see Managing keys and certificates
       in the IAM User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-access-key
          [--user-name <value>]
          --access-key-id <value>
          --status <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-name (string)
          The name of the user whose key you want to update.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters consisting of upper  and  lowercase  alphanumeric  characters
          with  no  spaces.  You can also include any of the following charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --access-key-id (string)
          The access key ID of the secret access key you want to update.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  that can consist of any upper or lowercased letter or digit.

       --status (string)
          The status you want to assign to the secret access key. Active means
          that  the  key can be used for programmatic calls to Amazon Web Ser-
          vices, while Inactive means that the key cannot be used.

          Possible values:

          o Active

          o Inactive

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To activate or deactivate an access key for an IAM user

       The  following  update-access-key  command  deactivates  the  specified
       access key (access key ID and secret access key) for the IAM user named
       Bob:

          aws iam update-access-key --access-key-id AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE --status Inactive --user-name Bob

       Deactivating the key means that it  cannot  be  used  for  programmatic
       access  to  AWS. However, the key is still available and can be reacti-
       vated.

       For more information, see Creating, Modifying, and Viewing  User  Secu-
       rity Credentials in the Using IAM guide.

OUTPUT
       None
