RESET-SERVICE-SPECIFIC-CREDENTIAL()        RESET-SERVICE-SPECIFIC-CREDENTIAL()



NAME
       reset-service-specific-credential -

DESCRIPTION
       Resets the password for a service-specific credential. The new password
       is Amazon Web Services generated and cryptographically strong. It  can-
       not  be  configured  by  the  user.  Resetting the password immediately
       invalidates the previous password associated with this user.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            reset-service-specific-credential
          [--user-name <value>]
          --service-specific-credential-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-name (string)
          The name of the IAM user associated with the  service-specific  cre-
          dential.  If this value is not specified, then the operation assumes
          the user whose credentials are used to call the operation.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  upper  and lowercase alphanumeric characters
          with no spaces. You can also include any of  the  following  charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --service-specific-credential-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the service-specific credential.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters that can consist of any upper or lowercased letter or  digit.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
