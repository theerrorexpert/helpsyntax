NAME
       simulate-principal-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Simulate how a set of IAM policies attached to an IAM entity works with
       a list of API operations and Amazon Web Services resources to determine
       the  policies'  effective  permissions.  The entity can be an IAM user,
       group, or role. If  you  specify  a  user,  then  the  simulation  also
       includes  all of the policies that are attached to groups that the user
       belongs to. You  can  simulate  resources  that  don't  exist  in  your
       account.

       You  can  optionally  include a list of one or more additional policies
       specified as strings to include in the simulation. If you want to simu-
       late  only  policies  specified  as  strings, use  SimulateCustomPolicy
       instead.

       You can also optionally include one resource-based policy to be  evalu-
       ated with each of the resources included in the simulation.

       The  simulation does not perform the API operations; it only checks the
       authorization to determine if the simulated policies allow or deny  the
       operations.
          Note:  This  operation  discloses  information about the permissions
          granted to other users. If you do not want users to see other user's
          permissions,  then consider allowing them to use  SimulateCustomPol-
          icy instead.

       Context keys are variables maintained by Amazon Web  Services  and  its
       services  that  provide  details  about  the  context  of  an API query
       request. You can use the Condition element of an IAM policy to evaluate
       context keys. To get the list of context keys that the policies require
       for correct simulation, use  GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy .

       If the output is long, you can use the MaxItems and  Marker  parameters
       to paginate the results.

       For  more information about using the policy simulator, see Testing IAM
       policies with the IAM policy simulator in the IAM User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       simulate-principal-policy is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: EvaluationResults

OPTIONS
       --policy-source-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a user, group, or role whose poli-
          cies you want to include in the simulation. If you specify  a  user,
          group,  or role, the simulation includes all policies that are asso-
          ciated with that entity. If you specify a user, the simulation  also
          includes  all  policies  that  are  attached  to any groups the user
          belongs to.

          The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in  this
          operation,  including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maxi-
          mum character counts of a managed policy with  no  whitespaces,  see
          IAM and STS character quotas .

          For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in
          the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

       --policy-input-list (list)
          An optional list of additional policy documents to  include  in  the
          simulation.  Each  document  is specified as a string containing the
          complete, valid JSON text of an IAM policy.

          The regex pattern used to validate this parameter  is  a  string  of
          characters consisting of the following:

          o Any  printable  ASCII  character  ranging from the space character
            (\u0020 ) through the end of the ASCII character range

          o The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement
            character set (through \u00FF )

          o The  special  characters  tab  (\u0009 ), line feed (\u000A ), and
            carriage return (\u000D )

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --permissions-boundary-policy-input-list (list)
          The IAM permissions boundary policy  to  simulate.  The  permissions
          boundary  sets the maximum permissions that the entity can have. You
          can input only one permissions boundary when you pass  a  policy  to
          this operation. An IAM entity can only have one permissions boundary
          in effect at a time. For  example,  if  a  permissions  boundary  is
          attached to an entity and you pass in a different permissions bound-
          ary policy using this parameter, then the new  permissions  boundary
          policy  is  used for the simulation. For more information about per-
          missions boundaries, see Permissions boundaries for IAM entities  in
          the  IAM User Guide . The policy input is specified as a string con-
          taining the complete, valid JSON text of a permissions boundary pol-
          icy.

          The  maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this
          operation, including whitespace, is listed below. To view the  maxi-
          mum  character  counts  of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see
          IAM and STS character quotas .

          The regex pattern used to validate this parameter  is  a  string  of
          characters consisting of the following:

          o Any  printable  ASCII  character  ranging from the space character
            (\u0020 ) through the end of the ASCII character range

          o The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement
            character set (through \u00FF )

          o The  special  characters  tab  (\u0009 ), line feed (\u000A ), and
            carriage return (\u000D )

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --action-names (list)
          A list of names of API operations to  evaluate  in  the  simulation.
          Each  operation  is evaluated for each resource. Each operation must
          include the service identifier, such as iam:CreateUser .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --resource-arns (list)
          A list of ARNs of Amazon Web Services resources to  include  in  the
          simulation.  If  this  parameter  is  not  provided,  then the value
          defaults to * (all resources). Each API in the ActionNames parameter
          is  evaluated  for each resource in this list. The simulation deter-
          mines the access result (allowed or denied) of each combination  and
          reports  it  in  the response. You can simulate resources that don't
          exist in your account.

          The simulation does not  automatically  retrieve  policies  for  the
          specified resources. If you want to include a resource policy in the
          simulation, then you must include the policy  as  a  string  in  the
          ResourcePolicy parameter.

          For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in
          the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --resource-policy (string)
          A resource-based policy to include in the simulation provided  as  a
          string. Each resource in the simulation is treated as if it had this
          policy attached. You can include only one resource-based policy in a
          simulation.

          The  maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this
          operation, including whitespace, is listed below. To view the  maxi-
          mum  character  counts  of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see
          IAM and STS character quotas .

          The regex pattern used to validate this parameter  is  a  string  of
          characters consisting of the following:

          o Any  printable  ASCII  character  ranging from the space character
            (\u0020 ) through the end of the ASCII character range

          o The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement
            character set (through \u00FF )

          o The  special  characters  tab  (\u0009 ), line feed (\u000A ), and
            carriage return (\u000D )

       --resource-owner (string)
          An Amazon Web Services account ID that specifies the  owner  of  any
          simulated  resource that does not identify its owner in the resource
          ARN. Examples of resource ARNs include an S3 bucket  or  object.  If
          ResourceOwner  is specified, it is also used as the account owner of
          any ResourcePolicy included in the simulation. If the  ResourceOwner
          parameter  is not specified, then the owner of the resources and the
          resource policy defaults to the account of the identity provided  in
          CallerArn  .  This  parameter  is  required  only  if  you specify a
          resource-based policy and account that owns the resource is  differ-
          ent  from the account that owns the simulated calling user CallerArn
          .

       --caller-arn (string)
          The ARN of the IAM user that you want to specify  as  the  simulated
          caller of the API operations. If you do not specify a CallerArn , it
          defaults to the ARN of the user that you specify in  PolicySourceArn
          ,  if  you  specified  a user. If you include both a PolicySourceArn
          (for example, arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/David ) and a CallerArn
          (for  example,  arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Bob  ), the result is
          that you simulate calling the API operations as Bob, as if  Bob  had
          David's policies.

          You  can specify only the ARN of an IAM user. You cannot specify the
          ARN of an assumed role, federated user, or a service principal.
              CallerArn is required if you include a  ResourcePolicy  and  the
              PolicySourceArn is not the ARN for an IAM user. This is required
              so that the resource-based  policy's  Principal  element  has  a
              value to use in evaluating the policy.

          For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in
          the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

       --context-entries (list)
          A list of context keys and corresponding values for  the  simulation
          to  use. Whenever a context key is evaluated in one of the simulated
          IAM permissions policies, the corresponding value is supplied.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a condition context key. It  includes
              the  name  of the key and specifies the value (or values, if the
              context key supports multiple values) to use in the  simulation.
              This  information is used when evaluating the Condition elements
              of the input policies.

              This data type is used as an input parameter to  SimulateCustom-
              Policy and  SimulatePrincipalPolicy .

              ContextKeyName -> (string)
                 The  full name of a condition context key, including the ser-
                 vice prefix. For example, aws:SourceIp or s3:VersionId .

              ContextKeyValues -> (list)
                 The value (or values, if the condition context  key  supports
                 multiple values) to provide to the simulation when the key is
                 referenced by a Condition element in an input policy.

                 (string)

              ContextKeyType -> (string)
                 The data type of the value (or values) specified in the  Con-
                 textKeyValues parameter.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ContextKeyName=string,ContextKeyValues=string,string,ContextKeyType=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ContextKeyName": "string",
              "ContextKeyValues": ["string", ...],
              "ContextKeyType": "string"|"stringList"|"numeric"|"numericList"|"boolean"|"booleanList"|"ip"|"ipList"|"binary"|"binaryList"|"date"|"dateList"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --resource-handling-option (string)
          Specifies  the  type  of simulation to run. Different API operations
          that support resource-based policies require different  combinations
          of  resources.  By  specifying  the  type  of simulation to run, you
          enable the policy simulator to enforce the presence of the  required
          resources  to ensure reliable simulation results. If your simulation
          does not match one of the following scenarios,  then  you  can  omit
          this  parameter. The following list shows each of the supported sce-
          nario values and the resources that you must define to run the simu-
          lation.

          Each of the EC2 scenarios requires that you specify instance, image,
          and security group resources. If your scenario includes an EBS  vol-
          ume,  then  you  must  specify that volume as a resource. If the EC2
          scenario includes VPC, then you must supply  the  network  interface
          resource.  If  it  includes  an IP subnet, then you must specify the
          subnet resource. For more information on the EC2  scenario  options,
          see Supported platforms in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

          o EC2-Classic-InstanceStore   instance, image, security group

          o EC2-Classic-EBS   instance, image, security group, volume

          o EC2-VPC-InstanceStore    instance,  image, security group, network
            interface

          o EC2-VPC-InstanceStore-Subnet   instance,  image,  security  group,
            network interface, subnet

          o EC2-VPC-EBS    instance, image, security group, network interface,
            volume

          o EC2-VPC-EBS-Subnet    instance,  image,  security  group,  network
            interface, subnet, volume

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To simulate the effects of an arbitrary IAM policy

       The following simulate-principal-policy shows how to  simulate  a  user
       calling  an  API action and determining whether the policies associated
       with that user allow or deny the action. In the following example,  the
       user  has  a  policy  that  allows only the codecommit:ListRepositories
       action.

          aws iam simulate-principal-policy \
              --policy-source-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/alejandro \
              --action-names codecommit:ListRepositories

       Output:

          {
              "EvaluationResults": [
                  {
                      "EvalActionName": "codecommit:ListRepositories",
                      "EvalResourceName": "*",
                      "EvalDecision": "allowed",
                      "MatchedStatements": [
                          {
                              "SourcePolicyId": "Grant-Access-To-CodeCommit-ListRepo",
                              "StartPosition": {
                                  "Line": 3,
                                  "Column": 19
                              },
                              "EndPosition": {
                                  "Line": 9,
                                  "Column": 10
                              }
                          }
                      ],
                      "MissingContextValues": []
                  }
              ]
          }

       The following simulate-custom-policy example shows the results of simu-
       lating  a  command that is prohibited by one of the user's policies. In
       the following example, the user has a policy that permits access  to  a
       DynamoDB  database  only  after a certain date and time. The simulation
       has the user attempting to access the database with an  aws:CurrentTime
       value that is earlier than the policy's condition permits.

          aws iam simulate-principal-policy \
              --policy-source-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/alejandro \
              --action-names dynamodb:CreateBackup \
              --context-entries "ContextKeyName='aws:CurrentTime',ContextKeyValues='2018-04-25T11:00:00Z',ContextKeyType=date"

       Output:

          {
              "EvaluationResults": [
                  {
                      "EvalActionName": "dynamodb:CreateBackup",
                      "EvalResourceName": "*",
                      "EvalDecision": "implicitDeny",
                      "MatchedStatements": [],
                      "MissingContextValues": []
                  }
              ]
          }

                 The ARN of the resource that the indicated API operation  was
                 tested on.

              EvalDecision -> (string)
                 The result of the simulation.

              MatchedStatements -> (list)
                 A list of the statements in the input policies that determine
                 the result for this scenario. Remember that even if  multiple
                 statements  allow  the operation on the resource, if only one
                 statement denies that operation, then the explicit deny over-
                 rides  any allow. In addition, the deny statement is the only
                 entry included in the result.

                 (structure)
                     Contains a reference to a Statement element in  a  policy
                     document that determines the result of the simulation.

                     This data type is used by the MatchedStatements member of
                     the ``  EvaluationResult `` type.

                     SourcePolicyId -> (string)
                        The identifier of the policy that was provided  as  an
                        input.

                     SourcePolicyType -> (string)
                        The type of the policy.

                     StartPosition -> (structure)
                        The  row  and column of the beginning of the Statement
                        in an IAM policy.

                        Line -> (integer)
                            The line containing the specified position in  the
                            document.

                        Column -> (integer)
                            The  column  in  the line containing the specified
                            position in the document.

                     EndPosition -> (structure)
                        The row and column of the end of a Statement in an IAM
                        policy.

                        Line -> (integer)
                            The  line containing the specified position in the
                            document.

                        Column -> (integer)
                            The column in the line  containing  the  specified
                            position in the document.

              MissingContextValues -> (list)
                 A  list  of  context  keys  that are required by the included
                 input policies but that were not provided by one of the input
                 parameters.  This list is used when the resource in a simula-
                 tion is "*", either  explicitly,  or  when  the  ResourceArns
                 parameter blank. If you include a list of resources, then any
                 missing  context  values  are  instead  included  under   the
                 ResourceSpecificResults section. To discover the context keys
                 used by a set of policies, you can  call   GetContextKeysFor-
                 CustomPolicy or  GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy .

                 (string)

              OrganizationsDecisionDetail -> (structure)
                 A  structure  that  details how Organizations and its service
                 control policies affect the results of the  simulation.  Only
                 applies if the simulated user's account is part of an organi-
                 zation.

                 AllowedByOrganizations -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether the simulated operation is  allowed  by
                     the  Organizations  service  control policies that impact
                     the simulated user's account.

              PermissionsBoundaryDecisionDetail -> (structure)
                 Contains information about  the  effect  that  a  permissions
                 boundary  has  on  a  policy  simulation when the boundary is
                 applied to an IAM entity.

                 AllowedByPermissionsBoundary -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether an action is allowed by  a  permissions
                     boundary that is applied to an IAM entity (user or role).
                     A value of true means that the permissions boundary  does
                     not  deny the action. This means that the policy includes
                     an Allow statement that  matches  the  request.  In  this
                     case, if an identity-based policy also allows the action,
                     the request is allowed.  A  value  of  false  means  that
                     either  the  requested  action is not allowed (implicitly
                     denied) or that the action is explicitly  denied  by  the
                     permissions  boundary. In both of these cases, the action
                     is not allowed, regardless of the identity-based  policy.

              EvalDecisionDetails -> (map)
                 Additional  details  about  the  results of the cross-account
                 evaluation decision. This parameter  is  populated  for  only
                 cross-account simulations. It contains a brief summary of how
                 each policy type contributes to the  final  evaluation  deci-
                 sion.

                 If  the simulation evaluates policies within the same account
                 and includes a resource ARN, then the  parameter  is  present
                 but  the response is empty. If the simulation evaluates poli-
                 cies within the same account and specifies all  resources  (*
                 ), then the parameter is not returned.

                 When  you  make  a cross-account request, Amazon Web Services
                 evaluates the request in the trusting account and the trusted
                 account.  The  request  is  allowed  only if both evaluations
                 return true . For more information  about  how  policies  are
                 evaluated,  see Evaluating policies within a single account .

                 If an Organizations SCP included  in  the  evaluation  denies
                 access,  the simulation ends. In this case, policy evaluation
                 does not proceed  any  further  and  this  parameter  is  not
                 returned.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              ResourceSpecificResults -> (list)
                 The individual results of the simulation of the API operation
                 specified in EvalActionName on each resource.

                 (structure)
                     Contains the result of the simulation  of  a  single  API
                     operation call on a single resource.

                     This  data type is used by a member of the  EvaluationRe-
                     sult data type.

                     EvalResourceName -> (string)
                        The name of the simulated resource, in Amazon Resource
                        Name (ARN) format.

                     EvalResourceDecision -> (string)
                        The  result  of  the  simulation  of the simulated API
                        operation on the resource specified  in  EvalResource-
                        Name .

                     MatchedStatements -> (list)
                        A  list  of  the statements in the input policies that
                        determine the result for this part of the  simulation.
                        Remember  that  even  if multiple statements allow the
                        operation on the resource,  if  any  statement  denies
                        that  operation,  then the explicit deny overrides any
                        allow. In addition, the deny  statement  is  the  only
                        entry included in the result.

                        (structure)
                            Contains  a  reference to a Statement element in a
                            policy document that determines the result of  the
                            simulation.

                            This  data  type  is used by the MatchedStatements
                            member of the ``  EvaluationResult `` type.

                            SourcePolicyId -> (string)
                               The identifier of the policy that was  provided
                               as an input.

                            SourcePolicyType -> (string)
                               The type of the policy.

                            StartPosition -> (structure)
                               The  row  and  column  of  the beginning of the
                               Statement in an IAM policy.

                               Line -> (integer)
                                   The line containing the specified  position
                                   in the document.

                               Column -> (integer)
                                   The column in the line containing the spec-
                                   ified position in the document.

                            EndPosition -> (structure)
                               The row and column of the end of a Statement in
                               an IAM policy.

                               Line -> (integer)
                                   The  line containing the specified position
                                   in the document.

                               Column -> (integer)
                                   The column in the line containing the spec-
                                   ified position in the document.

                     MissingContextValues -> (list)
                        A  list  of  context  keys  that  are  required by the
                        included input policies but that were not provided  by
                        one  of the input parameters. This list is used when a
                        list of ARNs is included in the ResourceArns parameter
                        instead  of  "*".  If  you  do  not specify individual
                        resources, by setting ResourceArns to "*"  or  by  not
                        including the ResourceArns parameter, then any missing
                        context values are instead included under the  Evalua-
                        tionResults section. To discover the context keys used
                        by a set of policies, you can call  GetContextKeysFor-
                        CustomPolicy or  GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy .

                        (string)

                     EvalDecisionDetails -> (map)
                        Additional details about the results of the evaluation
                        decision on  a  single  resource.  This  parameter  is
                        returned  only  for  cross-account  simulations.  This
                        parameter explains how each policy type contributes to
                        the resource-specific evaluation decision.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (string)

                     PermissionsBoundaryDecisionDetail -> (structure)
                        Contains  information  about the effect that a permis-
                        sions boundary has on a policy  simulation  when  that
                        boundary is applied to an IAM entity.

                        AllowedByPermissionsBoundary -> (boolean)
                            Specifies  whether  an action is allowed by a per-
                            missions boundary that is applied to an IAM entity
                            (user  or  role).  A  value of true means that the
                            permissions boundary does  not  deny  the  action.
                            This  means  that  the  policy  includes  an Allow
                            statement that matches the request. In this  case,
                            if   an  identity-based  policy  also  allows  the
                            action, the request is allowed. A value  of  false
                            means  that  either  the  requested  action is not
                            allowed (implicitly denied) or that the action  is
                            explicitly  denied by the permissions boundary. In
                            both of these cases, the action  is  not  allowed,
                            regardless of the identity-based policy.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A  flag  that  indicates  whether there are more items to return. If
          your results were truncated, you can make  a  subsequent  pagination
          request  using  the Marker request parameter to retrieve more items.
          Note that IAM might return fewer than the MaxItems number of results
          even  when  there  are more results available. We recommend that you
          check IsTruncated after every call to ensure that  you  receive  all
          your results.

       Marker -> (string)
          When  IsTruncated is true , this element is present and contains the
          value to use for the Marker parameter  in  a  subsequent  pagination
          request.
