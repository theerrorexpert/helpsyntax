       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-user
          [--path <value>]
          --user-name <value>
          [--permissions-boundary <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --path (string)
          The path for the user name. For more information  about  paths,  see
          IAM identifiers in the IAM User Guide .

          This  parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a
          slash (/).

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  either  a  forward  slash (/) by itself or a
          string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it
          can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021 ) through the DEL
          character (\u007F ), including most punctuation characters,  digits,
          and upper and lowercased letters.

       --user-name (string)
          The name of the user to create.

          IAM  user,  group,  role, and policy names must be unique within the
          account. Names are not distinguished by case. For example, you  can-
          not create resources named both "MyResource" and "myresource".

       --permissions-boundary (string)
          The  ARN  of the policy that is used to set the permissions boundary
          for the user.

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags that you want to attach to the  new  user.  Each  tag
          consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information
          about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in the IAM User Guide .

          NOTE:
              If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed  the  allowed
              maximum  number  of  tags, then the entire request fails and the
              resource is not created.

          (structure)
              A structure that represents user-provided metadata that  can  be
              associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tag-
              ging, see Tagging IAM resources in the IAM User Guide .

              Key -> (string)
                 The key name that can be used to  look  up  or  retrieve  the
                 associated  value. For example, Department or Cost Center are
                 common choices.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with  a
                 key  name  of  Department  could  have  values  such as Human
                 Resources , Accounting , and Support . Tags with a  key  name
                 of  Cost  Center might have values that consist of the number
                 associated with the different cost centers in  your  company.
                 Typically,  many  resources  have tags with the same key name
                 but with different values.

                 NOTE:
                     Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag Value as  a
                     single  string.  If  you  need to store an array, you can
                     store comma-separated values in the string. However,  you
                     must interpret the value in your code.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create an IAM user

       The  following create-user command creates an IAM user named Bob in the
       current account:

          aws iam create-user --user-name Bob

       Output:

          {
              "User": {
                  "UserName": "Bob",
                  "Path": "/",
                  "CreateDate": "2013-06-08T03:20:41.270Z",
                  "UserId": "AIDAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
                  "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Bob"
              }
          }

       Using IAM guide.

OUTPUT
       User -> (structure)
          A structure with details about the new IAM user.

          Path -> (string)
              The  path to the user. For more information about paths, see IAM
              identifiers in the IAM User Guide .

              The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions  boundary  for
              the user.

          UserName -> (string)
              The friendly name identifying the user.

          UserId -> (string)
              The  stable  and  unique  string  identifying the user. For more
              information about IDs, see IAM identifiers in the IAM User Guide
              .

          Arn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) that identifies the user. For
              more information about ARNs and how to use ARNs in policies, see
              IAM Identifiers in the IAM User Guide .

          CreateDate -> (timestamp)
              The  date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format , when the user
              was created.

          PasswordLastUsed -> (timestamp)
              The date and time, in ISO  8601  date-time  format  ,  when  the
              user's  password  was last used to sign in to an Amazon Web Ser-
              vices website. For a list of Amazon Web Services  websites  that
              capture  a  user's last sign-in time, see the Credential reports
              topic in the IAM User Guide . If a password is  used  more  than
              once  in  a  five-minute span, only the first use is returned in
              this field. If the field is null (no value), then  it  indicates
              that they never signed in with a password. This can be because:

              o The user never had a password.

              o A  password  exists  but  has  not been used since IAM started
                tracking this information on October 20, 2014.

              A null value does not mean that the user never had  a  password.
              Also, if the user does not currently have a password but had one
              in the past, then this field contains the date and time the most
              recent password was used.

              This value is returned only in the  GetUser and  ListUsers oper-
              ations.

          PermissionsBoundary -> (structure)
              For  more  information   about   permissions   boundaries,   see
              Permissions  boundaries for IAM identities in the IAM User Guide
              .

              PermissionsBoundaryType -> (string)
                 The permissions boundary usage type that indicates what  type
                 of  IAM  resource  is used as the permissions boundary for an
                 entity. This data type can only have a value of Policy .

              PermissionsBoundaryArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the policy used to set  the  permissions  boundary
                 for the user or role.

          Tags -> (list)
              A  list  of  tags  that  are  associated with the user. For more

              User Guide .

              (structure)
                 A  structure  that represents user-provided metadata that can
                 be associated with an  IAM  resource.  For  more  information
                 about  tagging,  see  Tagging  IAM  resources in the IAM User
                 Guide .

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve  the
                     associated  value. For example, Department or Cost Center
                     are common choices.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value associated with this  tag.  For  example,  tags
                     with  a  key name of Department could have values such as
                     Human Resources , Accounting , and Support . Tags with  a
                     key name of Cost Center might have values that consist of
                     the number associated with the different cost centers  in
                     your  company.  Typically,  many resources have tags with
                     the same key name but with different values.

                     NOTE:
                        Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag Value as
                        a  single  string.  If you need to store an array, you
                        can store comma-separated values in the  string.  How-
                        ever, you must interpret the value in your code.
