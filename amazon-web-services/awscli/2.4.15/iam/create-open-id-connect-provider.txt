CREATE-OPEN-ID-CONNECT-PROVIDER()            CREATE-OPEN-ID-CONNECT-PROVIDER()



NAME
       create-open-id-connect-provider -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an IAM entity to describe an identity provider (IdP) that sup-
       ports OpenID Connect (OIDC) .

       The OIDC provider that you create with this operation can be used as  a
       principal  in  a role's trust policy. Such a policy establishes a trust
       relationship between Amazon Web Services and the OIDC provider.

       If you are using an OIDC identity provider from  Google,  Facebook,  or
       Amazon  Cognito,  you  don't  need  to  create  a separate IAM identity
       provider. These OIDC identity providers are already built-in to  Amazon
       Web  Services  and  are  available  for your use. Instead, you can move
       directly to creating new roles using your identity provider.  To  learn
       more, see Creating a role for web identity or OpenID connect federation
       in the IAM User Guide .

       When you create the IAM OIDC provider, you specify the following:

       o The URL of the OIDC identity provider (IdP) to trust

       o A list of client IDs (also known  as  audiences)  that  identify  the
         application  or  applications  allowed to authenticate using the OIDC
         provider

       o A list of thumbprints of one or more server certificates that the IdP
         uses

       You  get  all  of this information from the OIDC IdP you want to use to
       access Amazon Web Services.

       NOTE:
          Amazon Web Services secures communication with  some  OIDC  identity
          providers (IdPs) through our library of trusted certificate authori-
          ties (CAs) instead of using a certificate thumbprint to verify  your
          IdP  server  certificate.  These OIDC IdPs include Google, and those
          that use an Amazon S3 bucket to host a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)  end-
          point.  In  these cases, your legacy thumbprint remains in your con-
          figuration, but is no longer used for validation.

       NOTE:
          The trust for the OIDC provider is derived  from  the  IAM  provider
          that  this  operation creates. Therefore, it is best to limit access
          to the  CreateOpenIDConnectProvider operation to  highly  privileged
          users.

SYNOPSIS
            create-open-id-connect-provider
          --url <value>
          [--client-id-list <value>]
          --thumbprint-list <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --url (string)
          The  URL  of the identity provider. The URL must begin with https://
          and should correspond to the iss claim in the provider's OpenID Con-
          nect  ID  tokens. Per the OIDC standard, path components are allowed
          but query parameters are not. Typically the URL consists of  only  a
          hostname,  like  https://server.example.org or https://example.com .
          The URL should not contain a port number.

          You cannot register the same provider multiple  times  in  a  single
          Amazon  Web  Services  account.  If you try to submit a URL that has
          already been used for an OpenID Connect provider in the  Amazon  Web
          Services account, you will get an error.

       --client-id-list (list)
          Provides  a  list  of  client  IDs,  also known as audiences. When a
          mobile or web app registers with an OpenID  Connect  provider,  they
          establish a value that identifies the application. This is the value
          that's sent as the client_id parameter on OAuth requests.

          You can register multiple client IDs with  the  same  provider.  For
          example, you might have multiple applications that use the same OIDC
          provider. You cannot register more than 100 client IDs with a single
          IAM OIDC provider.

          There is no defined format for a client ID. The CreateOpenIDConnect-
          ProviderRequest operation accepts client IDs up  to  255  characters
          long.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --thumbprint-list (list)
          A  list  of  server  certificate  thumbprints for the OpenID Connect
          (OIDC) identity provider's server certificates. Typically this  list
          includes  only  one  entry.  However,  IAM  lets you have up to five
          thumbprints for an OIDC provider. This lets  you  maintain  multiple
          thumbprints if the identity provider is rotating certificates.

          The  server  certificate  thumbprint  is  the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash
          value of the X.509 certificate used by the domain where  the  OpenID
          Connect provider makes its keys available. It is always a 40-charac-
          ter string.

          You must provide at least one thumbprint when creating an  IAM  OIDC
          provider. For example, assume that the OIDC provider is server.exam-
          ple.com    and    the    provider     stores     its     keys     at
          https://keys.server.example.com/openid-connect.  In  that  case, the
          thumbprint string would be the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value  of  the
          certificate used by https://keys.server.example.com.

          For  more  information about obtaining the OIDC provider thumbprint,
          see Obtaining the thumbprint for an OpenID Connect provider  in  the
          IAM User Guide .

          (string)
              Contains a thumbprint for an identity provider's server certifi-
              cate.

              The identity provider's server  certificate  thumbprint  is  the
              hex-encoded  SHA-1  hash value of the self-signed X.509 certifi-
              cate. This thumbprint is used by the  domain  where  the  OpenID
              Connect  provider  makes  its  keys available. The thumbprint is
              always a 40-character string.

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags that you want to attach to the new IAM OpenID Connect
          (OIDC)  provider.  Each tag consists of a key name and an associated
          value. For more information about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources
          in the IAM User Guide .

          NOTE:
              If  any  one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed
              maximum number of tags, then the entire request  fails  and  the
              resource is not created.

          (structure)
              A  structure  that represents user-provided metadata that can be
              associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tag-
              ging, see Tagging IAM resources in the IAM User Guide .

              Key -> (string)
                 The  key  name  that  can  be used to look up or retrieve the
                 associated value. For example, Department or Cost Center  are
                 common choices.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a
                 key name of  Department  could  have  values  such  as  Human
                 Resources  ,  Accounting , and Support . Tags with a key name
                 of Cost Center might have values that consist of  the  number
                 associated  with  the different cost centers in your company.
                 Typically, many resources have tags with the  same  key  name
                 but with different values.

                 NOTE:
                     Amazon  Web Services always interprets the tag Value as a
                     single string. If you need to store  an  array,  you  can
                     store  comma-separated values in the string. However, you
                     must interpret the value in your code.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider

       To create an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider,  we  recommend  using  the
       --cli-input-json  parameter  to  pass  a  JSON  file  that contains the
       required parameters. When you create an OIDC provider,  you  must  pass
       the  URL  of the provider, and the URL must begin with https://. It can
       be difficult to pass the URL as a command line parameter,  because  the
       colon (:) and forward slash (/) characters have special meaning in some
       command line environments. Using the  --cli-input-json  parameter  gets
       around this limitation.

       To  use  the  --cli-input-json  parameter,  start  by  using  the  cre-
       ate-open-id-connect-provider command with  the  --generate-cli-skeleton
       parameter, as in the following example:

          aws iam create-open-id-connect-provider --generate-cli-skeleton > create-open-id-connect-provider.json

       The  previous  command  creates  a JSON file called create-open-id-con-
       nect-provider.json that you can use to fill in the  information  for  a
       subsequent create-open-id-connect-provider command. For example:

          {
              "Url": "https://server.example.com",
              "ClientIDList": [
                  "example-application-ID"
              ],
              "ThumbprintList": [
                  "c3768084dfb3d2b68b7897bf5f565da8eEXAMPLE"
              ]
          }

       Next,  to  create  the  OpenID  Connect  (OIDC)  provider, use the cre-
       ate-open-id-connect-provider  command  again,  this  time  passing  the
       --cli-input-json  parameter  to  specify  your JSON file. The following
       create-open-id-connect-provider  command  uses   the   --cli-input-json
       parameter with a JSON file called create-open-id-connect-provider.json:

          aws iam create-open-id-connect-provider --cli-input-json file://create-open-id-connect-provider.json

       Output:

          {
              "OpenIDConnectProviderArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:oidc-provider/server.example.com"
          }

       Identity Providers in the Using IAM guide.

       For  more information about obtaining thumbprints for an OIDC provider,
       see Obtaining the Thumbprint for an  OpenID  Connect  Provider  in  the
       Using IAM guide.

OUTPUT
       OpenIDConnectProviderArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the  new  IAM OpenID Connect
          provider that is created. For more information, see   OpenIDConnect-
          ProviderListEntry .

       Tags -> (list)
          A  list  of tags that are attached to the new IAM OIDC provider. The
          returned list of tags is sorted by tag  key.  For  more  information
          about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in the IAM User Guide .

          (structure)
              A  structure  that represents user-provided metadata that can be
              associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tag-
              ging, see Tagging IAM resources in the IAM User Guide .

              Key -> (string)
                 The  key  name  that  can  be used to look up or retrieve the
                 associated value. For example, Department or Cost Center  are
                 common choices.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a
                 key name of  Department  could  have  values  such  as  Human
                 Resources  ,  Accounting , and Support . Tags with a key name
                 of Cost Center might have values that consist of  the  number
                 associated  with  the different cost centers in your company.
                 Typically, many resources have tags with the  same  key  name
                 but with different values.

                 NOTE:
                     Amazon  Web Services always interprets the tag Value as a
                     single string. If you need to store  an  array,  you  can
                     store  comma-separated values in the string. However, you
                     must interpret the value in your code.
