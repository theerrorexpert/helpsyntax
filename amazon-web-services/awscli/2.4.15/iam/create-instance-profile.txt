       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-instance-profile
          --instance-profile-name <value>
          [--path <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-profile-name (string)
          The name of the instance profile to create.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  upper  and lowercase alphanumeric characters
          with no spaces. You can also include any of  the  following  charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --path (string)
          The  path to the instance profile. For more information about paths,
          see IAM Identifiers in the IAM User Guide .

          This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to  a
          slash (/).

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters consisting of either a forward  slash  (/)  by  itself  or  a
          string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it
          can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021 ) through the DEL
          character  (\u007F ), including most punctuation characters, digits,
          and upper and lowercased letters.

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags that you want to attach  to  the  newly  created  IAM
          instance  profile. Each tag consists of a key name and an associated
          value. For more information about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources
          in the IAM User Guide .

          NOTE:
              If  any  one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed
              maximum number of tags, then the entire request  fails  and  the
              resource is not created.

          (structure)
              A  structure  that represents user-provided metadata that can be
              associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tag-
              ging, see Tagging IAM resources in the IAM User Guide .

              Key -> (string)
                 The  key  name  that  can  be used to look up or retrieve the
                 associated value. For example, Department or Cost Center  are
                 common choices.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a
                 key name of  Department  could  have  values  such  as  Human
                 Resources  ,  Accounting , and Support . Tags with a key name
                 of Cost Center might have values that consist of  the  number
                 associated  with  the different cost centers in your company.
                 Typically, many resources have tags with the  same  key  name
                 but with different values.

                 NOTE:
                     Amazon  Web Services always interprets the tag Value as a
                     single string. If you need to store  an  array,  you  can
                     store  comma-separated values in the string. However, you
                     must interpret the value in your code.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create an instance profile

       The following create-instance-profile command creates an instance  pro-
       file named Webserver:

          aws iam create-instance-profile --instance-profile-name Webserver

       Output:

          {
              "InstanceProfile": {
                  "InstanceProfileId": "AIPAJMBYC7DLSPEXAMPLE",
                  "Roles": [],
                  "CreateDate": "2015-03-09T20:33:19.626Z",
                  "InstanceProfileName": "Webserver",
                  "Path": "/",
                  "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:instance-profile/Webserver"
              }
          }

       To add a role to an instance profile, use the add-role-to-instance-pro-
       file command.

                               Amazon Web Services always interprets  the  tag
                               Value  as a single string. If you need to store
                               an array, you can store comma-separated  values
                               in  the string. However, you must interpret the

                     in which  the  role  was  last  used.  Activity  is  only
                     reported  for  the  trailing 400 days. This period can be
                     shorter if your Region began  supporting  these  features
                     within  the last year. The role might have been used more
                     than 400 days ago.  For  more  information,  see  Regions
                     where data is tracked in the IAM User Guide .

                     LastUsedDate -> (timestamp)
                        The  date  and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format that
                        the role was last used.

                        This field is null if  the  role  has  not  been  used
                        within  the  IAM tracking period. For more information
                        about the tracking period, see Regions where  data  is
                        tracked in the IAM User Guide .

                     Region -> (string)
                        The  name  of  the Amazon Web Services Region in which
                        the role was last used.

          Tags -> (list)
              A list of tags that are attached to the  instance  profile.  For
              more information about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in the
              IAM User Guide .

              (structure)
                 A structure that represents user-provided metadata  that  can
                 be  associated  with  an  IAM  resource. For more information
                 about tagging, see Tagging IAM  resources  in  the  IAM  User
                 Guide .

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the
                     associated value. For example, Department or Cost  Center
                     are common choices.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  value  associated  with  this tag. For example, tags
                     with a key name of Department could have values  such  as
                     Human  Resources , Accounting , and Support . Tags with a
                     key name of Cost Center might have values that consist of
                     the  number associated with the different cost centers in
                     your company. Typically, many resources  have  tags  with
                     the same key name but with different values.

                     NOTE:
                        Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag Value as
                        a single string. If you need to store  an  array,  you
                        can  store  comma-separated values in the string. How-
                        ever, you must interpret the value in your code.
