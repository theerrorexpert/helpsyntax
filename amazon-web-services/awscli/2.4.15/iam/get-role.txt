GET-ROLE()                                                          GET-ROLE()



NAME
       get-role -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information  about  the specified role, including the role's
       path, GUID, ARN, and the role's trust policy that grants permission  to
       assume  the  role.  For  more information about roles, see Working with
       roles .

       NOTE:
          Policies returned by this operation are URL-encoded  compliant  with
          RFC  3986  . You can use a URL decoding method to convert the policy
          back to plain JSON text. For example, if you use Java, you  can  use
          the  decode  method  of the java.net.URLDecoder utility class in the
          Java SDK. Other languages and SDKs provide similar functionality.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-role
          --role-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --role-name (string)
          The name of the IAM role to get information about.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  upper  and lowercase alphanumeric characters
          with no spaces. You can also include any of  the  following  charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about an IAM role

       The  following  get-role  command gets information about the role named
       Test-Role:

          aws iam get-role \
              --role-name Test-Role

       Output:

          {
              "Role": {
                  "Description": "Test Role",
                  "AssumeRolePolicyDocument":"<URL-encoded-JSON>",
                  "MaxSessionDuration": 3600,
                  "RoleId": "AROA1234567890EXAMPLE",
                  "CreateDate": "2019-11-13T16:45:56Z",
                  "RoleName": "Test-Role",
                  "Path": "/",
                  "RoleLastUsed": {
                      "Region": "us-east-1",
                      "LastUsedDate": "2019-11-13T17:14:00Z"
                  },
                  "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/Test-Role"
              }
          }

       The command displays the trust policy attached to the role. To list the
       permissions  policies  attached  to  a role, use the list-role-policies
       command.

              specify  the  duration  using  the  optional DurationSeconds API
              parameter or duration-seconds CLI parameter.

          PermissionsBoundary -> (structure)
              The ARN of the policy used to set the permissions  boundary  for
              the role.

              For   more   information   about   permissions  boundaries,  see
              Permissions boundaries for IAM identities in the IAM User  Guide

                 The  permissions boundary usage type that indicates what type
                 of IAM resource is used as the permissions  boundary  for  an

              PermissionsBoundaryArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of  the policy used to set the permissions boundary
                 for the user or role.

              A list of tags that are attached to the role. For more  informa-
              tion  about  tagging,  see Tagging IAM resources in the IAM User
              Guide .

              (structure)
                 A structure that represents user-provided metadata  that  can
                 be  associated  with  an  IAM  resource. For more information
                 about tagging, see Tagging IAM  resources  in  the  IAM  User
                 Guide .

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the
                     associated value. For example, Department or Cost  Center
                     are common choices.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  value  associated  with  this tag. For example, tags
                     with a key name of Department could have values  such  as
                     Human  Resources , Accounting , and Support . Tags with a
                     key name of Cost Center might have values that consist of
                     the  number associated with the different cost centers in
                     your company. Typically, many resources  have  tags  with
                     the same key name but with different values.

                     NOTE:
                        Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag Value as
                        a single string. If you need to store  an  array,  you
                        can  store  comma-separated values in the string. How-
                        ever, you must interpret the value in your code.

          RoleLastUsed -> (structure)
              Contains information about the last time that an  IAM  role  was
              used.  This  includes  the date and time and the Region in which
              the role was last used. Activity is only reported for the trail-
              ing  400  days.  This period can be shorter if your Region began
              supporting these features within the last year. The  role  might
              have been used more than 400 days ago. For more information, see
              Regions where data is tracked in the IAM User Guide .

              LastUsedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time format that the role
                 was last used.

                 This  field  is null if the role has not been used within the
                 IAM tracking period. For more information about the  tracking
                 period,  see  Regions  where  data is tracked in the IAM User
                 Guide .

              Region -> (string)
                 The name of the Amazon Web Services Region in which the  role
                 was last used.
