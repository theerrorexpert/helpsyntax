GET-INSTANCE-PROFILE()                                  GET-INSTANCE-PROFILE()



NAME
       get-instance-profile -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information  about the specified instance profile, including
       the instance profile's path, GUID, ARN, and role. For more  information
       about  instance  profiles,  see About instance profiles in the IAM User
       Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-instance-profile
          --instance-profile-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-profile-name (string)
          The name of the instance profile to get information about.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  upper  and lowercase alphanumeric characters
          with no spaces. You can also include any of  the  following  charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about an instance profile

       The  following  get-instance-profile command gets information about the
       instance profile named ExampleInstanceProfile:

          aws iam get-instance-profile --instance-profile-name ExampleInstanceProfile

       Output:

          {

                     information about tagging, see Tagging IAM  resources  in
                     the IAM User Guide .

                     (structure)
                        A  structure  that  represents  user-provided metadata
                        that can be associated with an IAM resource. For  more
                        information  about  tagging, see Tagging IAM resources
                        in the IAM User Guide .

                        Key -> (string)
                            The key name that  can  be  used  to  look  up  or
                            retrieve   the   associated  value.  For  example,
                            Department or Cost Center are common choices.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value associated with this tag.  For  example,
                            tags with a key name of Department could have val-
                            ues such as Human Resources  ,  Accounting  ,  and
                            Support  .  Tags  with  a  key name of Cost Center
                            might have values that consist of the number asso-
                            ciated  with  the  different  cost centers in your
                            company. Typically, many resources have tags  with
                            the same key name but with different values.

                            NOTE:
                               Amazon  Web  Services always interprets the tag
                               Value as a single string. If you need to  store
                               an  array, you can store comma-separated values
                               in the string. However, you must interpret  the
                               value in your code.

                 RoleLastUsed -> (structure)
                     Contains information about the last time that an IAM role
                     was used. This includes the date and time and the  Region
                     in  which  the  role  was  last  used.  Activity  is only
                     reported for the trailing 400 days. This  period  can  be
                     shorter  if  your  Region began supporting these features
                     within the last year. The role might have been used  more
                     than  400  days  ago.  For  more information, see Regions
                     where data is tracked in the IAM User Guide .

                     LastUsedDate -> (timestamp)
                        The date and time, in ISO 8601 date-time  format  that
                        the role was last used.

                        This  field  is  null  if  the  role has not been used
                        within the IAM tracking period. For  more  information
                        about  the  tracking period, see Regions where data is
                        tracked in the IAM User Guide .

                     Region -> (string)
                        The name of the Amazon Web Services  Region  in  which
                        the role was last used.

          Tags -> (list)
              A  list  of  tags that are attached to the instance profile. For
              more information about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in the
              IAM User Guide .

              (structure)
                 A  structure  that represents user-provided metadata that can
                 be associated with an  IAM  resource.  For  more  information
                 about  tagging,  see  Tagging  IAM  resources in the IAM User
                 Guide .

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve  the
                     associated  value. For example, Department or Cost Center
                     are common choices.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value associated with this  tag.  For  example,  tags
                     with  a  key name of Department could have values such as
                     Human Resources , Accounting , and Support . Tags with  a
                     key name of Cost Center might have values that consist of
                     the number associated with the different cost centers  in
                     your  company.  Typically,  many resources have tags with
                     the same key name but with different values.

                     NOTE:
                        Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag Value as
                        a  single  string.  If you need to store an array, you
                        can store comma-separated values in the  string.  How-
                        ever, you must interpret the value in your code.
