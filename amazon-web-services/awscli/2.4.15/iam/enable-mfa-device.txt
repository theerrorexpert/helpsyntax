ENABLE-MFA-DEVICE()                                        ENABLE-MFA-DEVICE()



NAME
       enable-mfa-device -

DESCRIPTION
       Enables  the  specified MFA device and associates it with the specified
       IAM user. When enabled, the MFA device is required for every subsequent
       login by the IAM user associated with the device.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            enable-mfa-device
          --user-name <value>
          --serial-number <value>
          --authentication-code1 <value>
          --authentication-code2 <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-name (string)
          The name of the IAM user for whom you want to enable the MFA device.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  upper  and lowercase alphanumeric characters
          with no spaces. You can also include any of  the  following  charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --serial-number (string)
          The  serial number that uniquely identifies the MFA device. For vir-
          tual MFA devices, the serial number is the device ARN.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  upper  and lowercase alphanumeric characters
          with no spaces. You can also include any of  the  following  charac-
          ters: =,.@:/-

       --authentication-code1 (string)
          An authentication code emitted by the device.

          The format for this parameter is a string of six digits.

          WARNING:
              Submit your request immediately after generating the authentica-
              tion codes. If you generate the codes and then wait too long  to
              submit  the request, the MFA device successfully associates with
              the user but the MFA device becomes out of  sync.  This  happens
              because  time-based  one-time  passwords  (TOTP)  expire after a
              short period of time. If this happens, you can resync the device
              .

       --authentication-code2 (string)
          A subsequent authentication code emitted by the device.

          The format for this parameter is a string of six digits.

          WARNING:
              Submit your request immediately after generating the authentica-
              tion codes. If you generate the codes and then wait too long  to
              submit  the request, the MFA device successfully associates with
              the user but the MFA device becomes out of  sync.  This  happens
              because  time-based  one-time  passwords  (TOTP)  expire after a
              short period of time. If this happens, you can resync the device
              .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To enable an MFA device

       After  you  use  the  create-virtual-mfa-device command to create a new
       virtual MFA device, you can assign the MFA device to a user.  The  fol-
       lowing enable-mfa-device example assigns the MFA device with the serial
       number arn:aws:iam::210987654321:mfa/BobsMFADevice to the user Bob. The
       command  also  synchronizes  the device with AWS by including the first
       two codes in sequence from the virtual MFA device.

          aws iam enable-mfa-device \
              --user-name Bob \
              --serial-number arn:aws:iam::210987654321:mfa/BobsMFADevice \
              --authentication-code1 123456 \
              --authentication-code2 789012

       This command produces no output.

       Identity and Access Management User Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
