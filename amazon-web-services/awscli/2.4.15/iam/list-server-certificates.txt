LIST-SERVER-CERTIFICATES()                          LIST-SERVER-CERTIFICATES()



NAME
       list-server-certificates -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  server  certificates  stored in IAM that have the specified
       path prefix. If none exist, the operation returns an empty list.

       You can paginate the results using the MaxItems and Marker  parameters.

       For  more  information  about  working  with  server  certificates, see
       Working with server certificates in the IAM User  Guide  .  This  topic
       also  includes  a list of Amazon Web Services services that can use the
       server certificates that you manage with IAM.

       NOTE:
          IAM resource-listing operations return a  subset  of  the  available
          attributes  for  the  resource. For example, this operation does not
          return tags, even though they  are  an  attribute  of  the  returned
          object.  To view all of the information for a servercertificate, see
          GetServerCertificate .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-server-certificates is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: ServerCertificateMetadataList

SYNOPSIS
            list-server-certificates
          [--path-prefix <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --path-prefix (string)
          The  path  prefix  for  filtering  the  results.  For example: /com-
          pany/servercerts would get all server  certificates  for  which  the
          path starts with /company/servercerts .

          This  parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a
          slash (/), listing all server certificates.  This  parameter  allows
          (through  its  regex  pattern ) a string of characters consisting of
          either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and
          end  with  forward  slashes.  In  addition, it can contain any ASCII
          character from the ! (\u0021 ) through the DEL character (\u007F  ),
          including  most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lower-
          cased letters.

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

                      "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:server-certificate/Org1/Org2/MyTestCert",
                      "UploadDate": "2015-04-21T18:14:16+00:00",
                      "Expiration": "2018-01-14T17:52:36+00:00"

OUTPUT
       ServerCertificateMetadataList -> (list)
          A list of server certificates.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a server certificate without its cer-
              tificate body, certificate chain, and private key.

              This data type is used as a response  element  in  the   Upload-
              ServerCertificate and  ListServerCertificates operations.

              Path -> (string)
                 The  path  to  the  server  certificate. For more information
                 about paths, see IAM identifiers in the IAM User Guide .

              ServerCertificateName -> (string)
                 The name that identifies the server certificate.

              ServerCertificateId -> (string)
                 The stable and unique string identifying the server  certifi-
                 cate.  For more information about IDs, see IAM identifiers in
                 the IAM User Guide .

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) specifying the server certifi-
                 cate.  For more information about ARNs and how to use them in
                 policies, see IAM identifiers in the IAM User Guide .

              UploadDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date when the server certificate was uploaded.

              Expiration -> (timestamp)
                 The date on which the certificate is set to expire.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether there are more  items  to  return.  If
          your  results  were  truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination
          request using the Marker request parameter to retrieve  more  items.
          Note that IAM might return fewer than the MaxItems number of results
          even when there are more results available. We  recommend  that  you
          check  IsTruncated  after  every call to ensure that you receive all
          your results.

       Marker -> (string)
          When IsTruncated is true , this element is present and contains  the
          value  to  use  for  the Marker parameter in a subsequent pagination
          request.
