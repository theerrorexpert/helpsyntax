SYNOPSIS
            list-open-id-connect-provider-tags
          --open-id-connect-provider-arn <value>
          [--marker <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --open-id-connect-provider-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of  the OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider whose tags
          you want to see.

          This parameter allows (through its regex pattern ) a string of char-
          acters  consisting  of  upper  and lowercase alphanumeric characters
          with no spaces. You can also include any of  the  following  charac-
          ters: _+=,.@-

       --marker (string)
          Use  this  parameter only when paginating results and only after you
          receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it
          to the value of the Marker element in the response that you received
          to indicate where the next call should start.

       --max-items (integer)
          Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum number
          of  items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond
          the maximum you specify, the IsTruncated response element is true  .

          If  you  do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults
          to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results,  even  when  there
          are  more  results available. In that case, the IsTruncated response
          element returns true , and Marker contains a value to include in the
          subsequent call that tells the service where to continue from.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Tags -> (list)
          The  list  of tags that are currently attached to the OpenID Connect
          (OIDC) identity provider. Each tag consists of a  key  name  and  an
          associated value. If no tags are attached to the specified resource,
          the response contains an empty list.

          (structure)
              A structure that represents user-provided metadata that  can  be
              associated with an IAM resource. For more information about tag-
              ging, see Tagging IAM resources in the IAM User Guide .

              Key -> (string)
                 The key name that can be used to  look  up  or  retrieve  the
                 associated  value. For example, Department or Cost Center are
                 common choices.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with  a
                 key  name  of  Department  could  have  values  such as Human
                 Resources , Accounting , and Support . Tags with a  key  name
                 of  Cost  Center might have values that consist of the number
                 associated with the different cost centers in  your  company.
                 Typically,  many  resources  have tags with the same key name
                 but with different values.

                 NOTE:
                     Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag Value as  a
                     single  string.  If  you  need to store an array, you can
                     store comma-separated values in the string. However,  you
                     must interpret the value in your code.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A  flag  that  indicates  whether there are more items to return. If
          your results were truncated, you can make  a  subsequent  pagination
          request  using  the Marker request parameter to retrieve more items.
          Note that IAM might return fewer than the MaxItems number of results
          even  when  there  are more results available. We recommend that you
          check IsTruncated after every call to ensure that  you  receive  all
          your results.

       Marker -> (string)
          When  IsTruncated is true , this element is present and contains the
          value to use for the Marker parameter  in  a  subsequent  pagination
          request.
