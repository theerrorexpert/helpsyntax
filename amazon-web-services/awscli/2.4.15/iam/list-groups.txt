LIST-GROUPS()                                                    LIST-GROUPS()



NAME
       list-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the IAM groups that have the specified path prefix.

       You  can paginate the results using the MaxItems and Marker parameters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-groups is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be  issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the  results  of  the  following  query
       expressions: Groups

SYNOPSIS
            list-groups
          [--path-prefix <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --path-prefix (string)
          The  path  prefix for filtering the results. For example, the prefix
          /division_abc/subdivision_xyz/ gets all  groups  whose  path  starts
          with /division_abc/subdivision_xyz/ .

          This  parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a
          slash (/), listing all groups. This parameter  allows  (through  its
          regex  pattern  ) a string of characters consisting of either a for-
          ward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin  and  end  with
          forward  slashes.  In  addition,  it can contain any ASCII character
          from the ! (\u0021 ) through the DEL character (\u007F ),  including
          most  punctuation  characters, digits, and upper and lowercased let-
          ters.

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the IAM groups for the current account

       The  following  list-groups command lists the IAM groups in the current
       account:

          aws iam list-groups

       Output:

          "Groups": [
            {
                "Path": "/",
                "CreateDate": "2013-06-04T20:27:27.972Z",
                "GroupId": "AIDACKCEVSQ6C2EXAMPLE",
                "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:group/Admins",
                "GroupName": "Admins"
            },
            {
                "Path": "/",
                "CreateDate": "2013-04-16T20:30:42Z",
                "GroupId": "AIDGPMS9RO4H3FEXAMPLE",
                "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:group/S3-Admins",
                "GroupName": "S3-Admins"
            }
          ]

       guide.

OUTPUT
       Groups -> (list)
          A list of groups.

          (structure)
              Contains information about an IAM group entity.

              This  data  type  is used as a response element in the following
              operations:

              o CreateGroup

              o GetGroup

              o ListGroups

              Path -> (string)
                 The path to the group. For more information about paths,  see
                 IAM identifiers in the IAM User Guide .

              GroupName -> (string)
                 The friendly name that identifies the group.

              GroupId -> (string)
                 The  stable and unique string identifying the group. For more
                 information about IDs, see IAM identifiers in  the  IAM  User
                 Guide .

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) specifying the group. For more
                 information about ARNs and how to use them in  policies,  see
                 IAM identifiers in the IAM User Guide .

              CreateDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time, in ISO 8601 date-time format , when the
                 group was created.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether there are more  items  to  return.  If
          your  results  were  truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination
          request using the Marker request parameter to retrieve  more  items.
          Note that IAM might return fewer than the MaxItems number of results
          even when there are more results available. We  recommend  that  you
          check  IsTruncated  after  every call to ensure that you receive all
          your results.

       Marker -> (string)
          When IsTruncated is true , this element is present and contains  the
          value  to  use  for  the Marker parameter in a subsequent pagination
          request.
