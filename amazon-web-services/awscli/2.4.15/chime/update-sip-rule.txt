SYNOPSIS
            update-sip-rule
          --sip-rule-id <value>
          --name <value>
          [--disabled | --no-disabled]
          [--target-applications <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --sip-rule-id (string)
          The SIP rule ID.

       --name (string)
          The new name for the specified SIP rule.

       --disabled | --no-disabled (boolean)
          The new value specified to indicate whether the rule is disabled.

       --target-applications (list)
          The new value of the list of target applications.

          (structure)
              Target SIP media application and other details, such as priority
              and AWS Region, to be specified in the SIP rule.  Only  one  SIP
              rule per AWS Region can be provided.

              SipMediaApplicationId -> (string)
                 The SIP media application ID.

              Priority -> (integer)
                 Priority of the SIP media application in the target list.

              AwsRegion -> (string)
                 The AWS Region of the target application.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SipMediaApplicationId=string,Priority=integer,AwsRegion=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "SipMediaApplicationId": "string",
              "Priority": integer,
              "AwsRegion": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
