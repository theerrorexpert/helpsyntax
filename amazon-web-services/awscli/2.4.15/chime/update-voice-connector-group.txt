OPTIONS

       --name (string)
          The name of the Amazon Chime Voice Connector group.

          (structure)
              For Amazon Chime Voice Connector groups, the Amazon Chime  Voice
              Connectors  to  which  to route inbound calls. Includes priority
              configuration settings. Limit: 3 VoiceConnectorItems per  Amazon
              Chime Voice Connector group.

              VoiceConnectorId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Chime Voice Connector ID.

              Priority -> (integer)
                 The  priority  associated with the Amazon Chime Voice Connec-
                 tor, with 1 being the highest priority. Higher priority  Ama-
                 zon Chime Voice Connectors are attempted first.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          VoiceConnectorId=string,Priority=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "VoiceConnectorId": "string",
              "Priority": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
