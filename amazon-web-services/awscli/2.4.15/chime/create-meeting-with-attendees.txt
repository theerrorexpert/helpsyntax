       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       Attendees -> (list)
          The attendee information, including attendees IDs and join tokens.

          (structure)
              An Amazon Chime SDK meeting attendee. Includes a  unique  Atten-
              deeId and JoinToken . The JoinToken allows a client to authenti-
              cate and join as the specified attendee. The  JoinToken  expires
              when  the  meeting ends or when  DeleteAttendee is called. After
              that, the attendee is unable to join the meeting.

              We recommend securely  transferring  each  JoinToken  from  your
              server  application  to  the  client so that no other client has
              access to the token except for the one authorized  to  represent
              the attendee.

                 cation.

              AttendeeId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Chime SDK attendee ID.

              JoinToken -> (string)
                 The join token used by the Amazon Chime SDK attendee.

       Errors -> (list)
          If the action fails for one or more of the attendees in the request,
          a list of the attendees is returned,  along  with  error  codes  and
          error messages.

          (structure)
              The  list  of errors returned when errors are encountered during
              the  BatchCreateAttendee  and   CreateAttendee   actions.   This
              includes external user IDs, error codes, and error messages.

                 cation.
