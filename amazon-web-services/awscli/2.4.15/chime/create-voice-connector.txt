CREATE-VOICE-CONNECTOR()                              CREATE-VOICE-CONNECTOR()



NAME
       create-voice-connector -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  Amazon Chime Voice Connector under the administrator's AWS
       account. You can choose to create an Amazon Chime Voice Connector in  a
       specific AWS Region.

       Enabling  CreateVoiceConnectorRequest$RequireEncryption configures your
       Amazon Chime Voice Connector to use TLS transport for SIP signaling and
       Secure RTP (SRTP) for media. Inbound calls use TLS transport, and unen-
       crypted outbound calls are blocked.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-voice-connector
          --name <value>
          [--aws-region <value>]
          --require-encryption | --no-require-encryption
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the Amazon Chime Voice Connector.

       --aws-region (string)
          The AWS Region in which the Amazon Chime Voice Connector is created.
          Default value: us-east-1 .

          Possible values:

          o us-east-1

          o us-west-2

       --require-encryption | --no-require-encryption (boolean)
          When enabled, requires encryption for the Amazon Chime Voice Connec-
          tor.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create an Amazon Chime Voice Connector

       The following create-voice-connector example creates  an  Amazon  Chime
       Voice Connector in the specified AWS Region, with encryption enabled.

          aws chime create-voice-connector \
              --name newVoiceConnector \
              --aws-region us-west-2 \
              --require-encryption

       Output:

          {
              "VoiceConnector": {
                  "VoiceConnectorId": "abcdef1ghij2klmno3pqr4",
                  "AwsRegion": "us-west-2",
                  "Name": "newVoiceConnector",
                  "OutboundHostName": "abcdef1ghij2klmno3pqr4.voiceconnector.chime.aws",
                  "RequireEncryption": true,
                  "CreatedTimestamp": "2019-09-18T20:34:01.352Z",
                  "UpdatedTimestamp": "2019-09-18T20:34:01.352Z"
              }
          }
