NAME
       delete-account -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the specified Amazon Chime account. You must suspend all users
       before deleting Team account. You can use the  BatchSuspendUser  action
       to dodo.

       For  EnterpriseLWA  and  EnterpriseAD  accounts,  you  must release the
       claimed domains for your Amazon Chime account before deletion. As  soon
       as  you release the domain, all users under that account are suspended.

       Deleted accounts appear in your Disabled accounts list for 90 days.  To
       restore deleted account from your Disabled accounts list, you must con-
       tact AWS Support.

       After 90 days, deleted accounts are permanently removed from your  Dis-
       abled accounts list.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-account
          --account-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Chime account ID.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
