LIST-CHANNEL-MEMBERSHIPS-FOR-ALIST-CHANNEL-MEMBERSHIPS-FOR-APP-INSTANCE-USER()



NAME
       list-channel-memberships-for-app-instance-user -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all channels that a particular AppInstanceUser is a part of. Only
       an AppInstanceAdmin can call the API with a user ARN that is not  their
       own.

       NOTE:
          The  x-amz-chime-bearer  request header is mandatory. Use the AppIn-
          stanceUserArn of the user that makes the API call as  the  value  in
          the header.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-channel-memberships-for-app-instance-user
          [--app-instance-user-arn <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--chime-bearer <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --app-instance-user-arn (string)
          The ARN of the AppInstanceUser s

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of users that you want returned.

       --next-token (string)
          The  token  returned  from previous API requests until the number of
          channel memberships is reached.

       --chime-bearer (string)
          The AppInstanceUserArn of the user that makes the API call.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
