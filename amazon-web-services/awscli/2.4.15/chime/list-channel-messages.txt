LIST-CHANNEL-MESSAGES()                                LIST-CHANNEL-MESSAGES()



NAME
       list-channel-messages -

DESCRIPTION
       List  all  the messages in a channel. Returns a paginated list of Chan-
       nelMessages . By default, sorted by creation  timestamp  in  descending
       order.

       NOTE:
          Redacted  messages  appear  in  the results as empty, since they are
          only redacted, not deleted. Deleted messages do not  appear  in  the
          results.  This action always returns the latest version of an edited
          message.

          Also, the x-amz-chime-bearer request header is  mandatory.  Use  the
          AppInstanceUserArn  of the user that makes the API call as the value
          in the header.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-channel-messages
          --channel-arn <value>
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--not-before <value>]
          [--not-after <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--chime-bearer <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel-arn (string)
          The ARN of the channel.

       --sort-order (string)
          The order in which you want messages sorted. Default is  Descending,
          based on time created.

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --not-before (timestamp)
          The initial or starting time stamp for your requested messages.

       --not-after (timestamp)
          The final or ending time stamp for your requested messages.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of messages that you want returned.

       --next-token (string)
          The  token passed by previous API calls until all requested messages
          are returned.

       --chime-bearer (string)
          The AppInstanceUserArn of the user that makes the API call.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
