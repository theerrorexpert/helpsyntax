SYNOPSIS
            put-retention-settings
          --account-id <value>
          --retention-settings <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Chime account ID.

       --retention-settings (structure)
          The retention settings.

          RoomRetentionSettings -> (structure)
              The chat room retention settings.

              RetentionDays -> (integer)
                 The number of days for which to retain chat-room messages.

          ConversationRetentionSettings -> (structure)
              The chat conversation retention settings.

              RetentionDays -> (integer)
                 The number of days for which to retain conversation messages.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RoomRetentionSettings={RetentionDays=integer},ConversationRetentionSettings={RetentionDays=integer}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "RoomRetentionSettings": {
              "RetentionDays": integer
            },
            "ConversationRetentionSettings": {
              "RetentionDays": integer
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
