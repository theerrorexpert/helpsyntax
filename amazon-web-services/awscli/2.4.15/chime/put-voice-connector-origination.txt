NAME
       put-voice-connector-origination -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  origination settings for the specified Amazon Chime Voice Connec-
       tor.

       NOTE:
          If emergency calling is configured for the Amazon Chime  Voice  Con-
          nector,  it  must  be  deleted prior to turning off origination set-
          tings.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-voice-connector-origination
          --voice-connector-id <value>
          --origination <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --voice-connector-id (string)
          The Amazon Chime Voice Connector ID.

       --origination (structure)
          The origination setting details to add.

          Routes -> (list)
              The call distribution properties defined  for  your  SIP  hosts.
              Valid  range:  Minimum  value  of  1.  Maximum value of 20. This
              parameter is not required, but you must specify  this  parameter
              or Disabled .

              (structure)
                 Origination  routes  define  call distribution properties for
                 your SIP hosts to receive inbound  calls  using  your  Amazon
                 Chime Voice Connector. Limit: Ten origination routes for each
                 Amazon Chime Voice Connector.

                 NOTE:
                     The parameters listed below are  not  required,  but  you
                     must use at least one.

                 Host -> (string)
                     The  FQDN  or IP address to contact for origination traf-
                     fic.

                 Port -> (integer)
                     The designated origination route port. Defaults to  5060.

                 Protocol -> (string)
                     The  protocol  to  use for the origination route. Encryp-
                     tion-enabled Amazon Chime Voice Connectors use TCP proto-
                     col by default.

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     The  priority  associated with the host, with 1 being the
                     highest priority. Higher  priority  hosts  are  attempted
                     first.

                 Weight -> (integer)
                     The  weight  associated with the host. If hosts are equal
                     in priority, calls are redistributed among them based  on
                     their relative weight.

          Disabled -> (boolean)
              When  origination  settings  are disabled, inbound calls are not
              enabled for your Amazon Chime Voice Connector. This parameter is
              not required, but you must specify this parameter or Routes .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Routes=[{Host=string,Port=integer,Protocol=string,Priority=integer,Weight=integer},{Host=string,Port=integer,Protocol=string,Priority=integer,Weight=integer}],Disabled=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Routes": [
              {
                "Host": "string",
                "Port": integer,
                "Protocol": "TCP"|"UDP",
                "Priority": integer,
                "Weight": integer
              }
              ...
            ],
            "Disabled": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To set up origination settings

       The following put-voice-connector-origination example sets up the orig-
       ination host, port, protocol, priority, and weight  for  the  specified
       Amazon Chime Voice Connector.

          aws chime put-voice-connector-origination \
              --voice-connector-id abcdef1ghij2klmno3pqr4 \
              --origination Routes=[{Host="10.24.34.0",Port=1234,Protocol="TCP",Priority=1,Weight=5}],Disabled=false

       Output:

          {
              "Origination": {
                  "Routes": [
                      {
                          "Host": "10.24.34.0",
                          "Port": 1234,
                          "Protocol": "TCP",
                          "Priority": 1,
                          "Weight": 5
                      }
                  ],
                  "Disabled": false
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       Origination -> (structure)
          The updated origination setting details.

          Routes -> (list)
              The call distribution properties defined  for  your  SIP  hosts.
              Valid  range:  Minimum  value  of  1.  Maximum value of 20. This
              parameter is not required, but you must specify  this  parameter
              or Disabled .

              (structure)
                 Origination  routes  define  call distribution properties for
                 your SIP hosts to receive inbound  calls  using  your  Amazon
                 Chime Voice Connector. Limit: Ten origination routes for each
                 Amazon Chime Voice Connector.

                 NOTE:
                     The parameters listed below are  not  required,  but  you
                     must use at least one.

                 Host -> (string)
                     The  FQDN  or IP address to contact for origination traf-
                     fic.

                 Port -> (integer)
                     The designated origination route port. Defaults to  5060.

                 Protocol -> (string)
                     The  protocol  to  use for the origination route. Encryp-
                     tion-enabled Amazon Chime Voice Connectors use TCP proto-
                     col by default.

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     The  priority  associated with the host, with 1 being the
                     highest priority. Higher  priority  hosts  are  attempted
                     first.

                 Weight -> (integer)
                     The  weight  associated with the host. If hosts are equal
                     in priority, calls are redistributed among them based  on
                     their relative weight.

          Disabled -> (boolean)
              When  origination  settings  are disabled, inbound calls are not
              enabled for your Amazon Chime Voice Connector. This parameter is
              not required, but you must specify this parameter or Routes .
