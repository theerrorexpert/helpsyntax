BATCH-SUSPEND-USER()                                      BATCH-SUSPEND-USER()



NAME
       batch-suspend-user -

DESCRIPTION
       Suspends  up  to  50  users  from  a Team or EnterpriseLWA Amazon Chime
       account. For  more  information  about  different  account  types,  see
       Managing  Your Amazon Chime Accounts in the Amazon Chime Administration
       Guide .

       Users  suspended  from  a  Team  account  are  disassociated  from  the
       account,but  they  can  continue  to use Amazon Chime as free users. To
       remove the suspension from suspended Team account users, invite them to
       the Team account again. You can use the  InviteUsers action to do so.

       Users  suspended  from  an EnterpriseLWA account are immediately signed
       out of Amazon Chime and can no longer sign in. To remove the suspension
       from suspended EnterpriseLWA account users, use the  BatchUnsuspendUser
       action.

       To sign out users without suspending them, use the  LogoutUser  action.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-suspend-user
          --account-id <value>
          --user-id-list <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Chime account ID.

       --user-id-list (list)
          The request containing the user IDs to suspend.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To suspend multiple users

       The following batch-suspend-user example suspends the listed users from
       the specified Amazon Chime account.

          aws chime batch-suspend-user \
              --account-id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-11111EXAMPLE \
              --user-id-list "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-22222EXAMPLE" "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-33333EXAMPLE" "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-44444EXAMPLE"

       Output:

          {
              "UserErrors": []
          }

OUTPUT
       UserErrors -> (list)
          If the  BatchSuspendUser action fails for one or more  of  the  user
          IDs  in  the request, a list of the user IDs is returned, along with
          error codes and error messages.
