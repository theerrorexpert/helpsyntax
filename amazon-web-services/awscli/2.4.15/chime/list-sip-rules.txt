NAME
       list-sip-rules -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the SIP rules under the administrator's AWS account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-sip-rules
          [--sip-media-application-id <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --sip-media-application-id (string)
          The SIP media application ID.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number of results to return in a single call. Defaults
          to 100.

       --next-token (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          List of SIP rules and rule details.

          (structure)
              The SIP rule  details,  including  name,  triggers,  and  target
              applications. An AWS account can have multiple SIP rules.

                 The SIP rule ID.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the SIP rule.

              Disabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  the  SIP rule is enabled or disabled. You
                 must disable a rule before you can delete it.

              TriggerType -> (string)
                 The type of trigger assigned to the SIP rule in  TriggerValue

                 customer-owned phone number in E164 format. SipRule is  trig-

                 matches in the incoming SIP request.

              TargetApplications -> (list)
                 Target SIP media application and other details, such as  pri-
                 ority  and  AWS Region, to be specified in the SIP rule. Only
                 one SIP rule per AWS Region can be provided.

                     Target SIP media application and other details,  such  as
                     priority and AWS Region, to be specified in the SIP rule.
                     Only one SIP rule per AWS Region can be provided.

                     SipMediaApplicationId -> (string)
                        The SIP media application ID.

                     Priority -> (integer)
                        Priority of the SIP media application  in  the  target
                        list.

                     AwsRegion -> (string)
                        The AWS Region of the target application.

              CreatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The  time at which the SIP rule was created, in ISO 8601 for-
                 mat.
