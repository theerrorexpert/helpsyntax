SYNOPSIS
            batch-create-room-membership
          --account-id <value>
          --room-id <value>
          --membership-item-list <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Chime account ID.

       --room-id (string)
          The room ID.

       --membership-item-list (list)
          The list of membership items.

          (structure)
              Membership details, such as member ID and member role.

              MemberId -> (string)
                 The member ID.

              Role -> (string)
                 The member role.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MemberId=string,Role=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "MemberId": "string",
              "Role": "Administrator"|"Member"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       to  a chat room as chat room members. It also assigns administrator and
       member roles to the users.
