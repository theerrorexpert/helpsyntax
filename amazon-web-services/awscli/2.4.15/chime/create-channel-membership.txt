CREATE-CHANNEL-MEMBERSHIP()                        CREATE-CHANNEL-MEMBERSHIP()



NAME
       create-channel-membership -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  a user to a channel. The InvitedBy response field is derived from
       the request header. A channel member can:

       o List messages

       o Send messages

       o Receive messages

       o Edit their own messages

       o Leave the channel

       Privacy settings impact this action as follows:

       o Public Channels: You do not need to be a member to list messages, but
         you must be a member to send messages.

       o Private Channels: You must be a member to list or send messages.

       NOTE:
          The  x-amz-chime-bearer  request header is mandatory. Use the AppIn-
          stanceUserArn of the user that makes the API call as  the  value  in
          the header.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-channel-membership
          --channel-arn <value>
          --member-arn <value>
          --type <value>
          [--chime-bearer <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel-arn (string)
          The ARN of the channel to which you're adding users.

       --member-arn (string)
          The ARN of the member you want to add to the channel.

       --type (string)
          The  membership  type of a user, DEFAULT or HIDDEN . Default members
          are always returned as part of ListChannelMemberships . Hidden  mem-
          bers  are only returned if the type filter in ListChannelMemberships
          equals HIDDEN . Otherwise hidden members are not returned.  This  is
          only supported by moderators.

          Possible values:

          o DEFAULT

          o HIDDEN

       --chime-bearer (string)
          The AppInstanceUserArn of the user that makes the API call.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ChannelArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the channel.

       Member -> (structure)
          The ARN and metadata of the member being added.

          Arn -> (string)
              The ARN in an Identity.

          Name -> (string)
              The name in an Identity.
