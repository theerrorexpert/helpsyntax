NAME
       create-sip-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a SIP rule which can be used to run a SIP media application as
       a target for a specific trigger type.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-sip-rule
          --name <value>
          --trigger-type <value>
          --trigger-value <value>
          [--disabled | --no-disabled]
          --target-applications <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the SIP rule.

       --trigger-type (string)
          The type of trigger assigned to the SIP rule in TriggerValue ,  cur-
          rently RequestUriHostname or ToPhoneNumber .

          Possible values:

          o ToPhoneNumber

          o RequestUriHostname

       --trigger-value (string)
          If TriggerType is RequestUriHostname , the value can be the outbound
          host name of an Amazon Chime  Voice  Connector.  If  TriggerType  is
          ToPhoneNumber  ,  the  value can be a customer-owned phone number in
          the E164 format. The SipMediaApplication specified in the SipRule is
          triggered  if the request URI in an incoming SIP request matches the
          RequestUriHostname , or if the To header in the incoming SIP request
          matches the ToPhoneNumber value.

       --disabled | --no-disabled (boolean)
          Enables  or  disables  a rule. You must disable rules before you can
          delete them.

       --target-applications (list)
          List of SIP media applications with priority and  AWS  Region.  Only
          one SIP application per AWS Region can be used.

          (structure)
              Target SIP media application and other details, such as priority
              and AWS Region, to be specified in the SIP rule.  Only  one  SIP
              rule per AWS Region can be provided.

              SipMediaApplicationId -> (string)
                 The SIP media application ID.

              Priority -> (integer)
                 Priority of the SIP media application in the target list.

              AwsRegion -> (string)
                 The AWS Region of the target application.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SipMediaApplicationId=string,Priority=integer,AwsRegion=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "SipMediaApplicationId": "string",
              "Priority": integer,
              "AwsRegion": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SipRule -> (structure)
          Returns  the  SIP rule information, including the rule ID, triggers,
          and target applications.

          SipRuleId -> (string)
              The SIP rule ID.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the SIP rule.

          Disabled -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether the SIP rule is enabled or disabled. You  must
              disable a rule before you can delete it.

          TriggerType -> (string)
              The  type  of trigger assigned to the SIP rule in TriggerValue ,

          TriggerValue -> (string)
              If TriggerType is RequestUriHostname , then the value can be the
              outbound host name of the Amazon Chime Voice Connector. If Trig-
              gerType is  ToPhoneNumber  ,  then  the  value  can  be  a  cus-
              tomer-owned  phone  number  in E164 format. SipRule is triggered
              when a SIP rule requests host name or ToPhoneNumber  matches  in
              the incoming SIP request.

          TargetApplications -> (list)
              Target SIP media application and other details, such as priority
              and AWS Region, to be specified in the SIP rule.  Only  one  SIP
              rule per AWS Region can be provided.

              (structure)
                 Target  SIP media application and other details, such as pri-
                 ority and AWS Region, to be specified in the SIP  rule.  Only
                 one SIP rule per AWS Region can be provided.

                 SipMediaApplicationId -> (string)
                     The SIP media application ID.

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     Priority of the SIP media application in the target list.

                 AwsRegion -> (string)
                     The AWS Region of the target application.

          CreatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The time at which the SIP rule was created, in ISO 8601  format.

          UpdatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The  time  at  which  the SIP rule was last updated, in ISO 8601
