NAME
       list-queued-messages -

DESCRIPTION
       The operation to list queued messages.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-queued-messages
          --id <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--wireless-device-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          Id  of  a  given wireless device which the downlink packets are tar-
          geted

       --next-token (string)
          To retrieve the next set of results, the nextToken value from a pre-
          vious  response; otherwise null to receive the first set of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return in this operation.

       --wireless-device-type (string)
          The wireless device type, it is either Sidewalk or LoRaWAN.

          Possible values:

          o Sidewalk

          o LoRaWAN

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          To retrieve the next set of results, the nextToken value from a pre-
          vious  response; otherwise null to receive the first set of results.

       DownlinkQueueMessagesList -> (list)
          The messages in downlink queue.

          (structure)
              The message in downlink queue.

              MessageId -> (string)
                 The messageId allocated by IoT Wireless for tracing purpose

              TransmitMode -> (integer)
                 The transmit mode to use to send data to the wireless device.
                 Can  be:  0 for UM (unacknowledge mode) or 1 for AM (acknowl-
                 edge mode).

              ReceivedAt -> (string)
                 The timestamp that Iot Wireless received the message.

              LoRaWAN -> (structure)
                 LoRaWAN router info.

                 FPort -> (integer)
                     The Fport value.
