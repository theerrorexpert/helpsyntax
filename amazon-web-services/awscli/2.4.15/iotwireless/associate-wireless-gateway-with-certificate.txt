NAME
       associate-wireless-gateway-with-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates a wireless gateway with a certificate.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            associate-wireless-gateway-with-certificate
          --id <value>
          --iot-certificate-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The ID of the resource to update.

       --iot-certificate-id (string)
          The ID of the certificate to associate with the wireless gateway.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To associate the certificate with the wireless gateway

       The  following associate-wireless-gateway-with-certificate associates a
       wireless gateway with a certificate.

          aws iotwireless associate-wireless-gateway-with-certificate \
              --id "12345678-a1b2-3c45-67d8-e90fa1b2c34d" \
              --iot-certificate-id "a123b45c6d78e9f012a34cd5e6a7890b12c3d45e6f78a1b234c56d7e890a1234"

       Output:

          {
              "IotCertificateId": "a123b45c6d78e9f012a34cd5e6a7890b12c3d45e6f78a1b234c56d7e890a1234"
          }

       IoT Core for LoRaWAN in the AWS IoT Developers Guide.

OUTPUT
       IotCertificateId -> (string)
          The ID of the certificate associated with the wireless gateway.
