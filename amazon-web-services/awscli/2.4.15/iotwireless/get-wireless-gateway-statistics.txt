GET-WIRELESS-GATEWAY-STATISTICS()            GET-WIRELESS-GATEWAY-STATISTICS()



NAME
       get-wireless-gateway-statistics -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets operating information about a wireless gateway.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-wireless-gateway-statistics
          --wireless-gateway-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --wireless-gateway-id (string)
          The ID of the wireless gateway for which to get the data.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get operating information about a wireless gateway

       The  following  get-wireless-gateway-statistics  example gets operating
       information about a wireless gateway.

          aws iotwireless get-wireless-gateway-statistics \
              --wireless-gateway-id "3039b406-5cc9-4307-925b-9948c63da25b"

       Output:

          {
              "WirelessGatewayId": "3039b406-5cc9-4307-925b-9948c63da25b"
          }

       Core for LoRaWAN in the AWS IoT Developers Guide.

OUTPUT
       WirelessGatewayId -> (string)
          The ID of the wireless gateway.

       LastUplinkReceivedAt -> (string)
          The date and time when the most recent uplink was received.

       ConnectionStatus -> (string)
          The connection status of the wireless gateway.
