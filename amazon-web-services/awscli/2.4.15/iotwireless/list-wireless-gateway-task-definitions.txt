NAME
       list-wireless-gateway-task-definitions -

DESCRIPTION
       List  the  wireless  gateway  tasks  definitions registered to your AWS
       account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-wireless-gateway-task-definitions
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--task-definition-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return in this operation.

       --next-token (string)
          To retrieve the next set of results, the nextToken value from a pre-
          vious  response; otherwise null to receive the first set of results.

       --task-definition-type (string)
          A filter to list only the wireless gateway task definitions that use
          this task definition type.

          Possible values:

          o UPDATE

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the wireless gateway task definitions

       The  following list-wireless-gateway-task-definitions example lists the
       available wireless gateway task  definitions  registered  to  your  AWS
