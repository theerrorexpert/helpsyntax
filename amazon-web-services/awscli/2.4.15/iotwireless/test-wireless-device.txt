TEST-WIRELESS-DEVICE()                                  TEST-WIRELESS-DEVICE()



NAME
       test-wireless-device -

DESCRIPTION
       Simulates  a  provisioned  device  by sending an uplink data payload of
       Hello .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            test-wireless-device
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The ID of the wireless device to test.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To test the wireless device

       The following test-wireless-device example sends uplink data  of  Hello
       to a device with specified ID.

          aws iotwireless test-wireless-device \
              --id "11aa5eae-2f56-4b8e-a023-b28d98494e49"

       Output:

          {
              Result: "Test succeeded. one message is sent with payload: hello"
          }

       Core for LoRaWAN in the AWS IoT Developers Guide.

OUTPUT
       Result -> (string)
          The result returned by the test.
