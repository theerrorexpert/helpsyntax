GET-WIRELESS-GATEWAY()                                  GET-WIRELESS-GATEWAY()



NAME
       get-wireless-gateway -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about a wireless gateway.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-wireless-gateway
          --identifier <value>
          --identifier-type <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --identifier (string)
          The identifier of the wireless gateway to get.

       --identifier-type (string)
          The type of identifier used in identifier .

          Possible values:

          o GatewayEui

          o WirelessGatewayId

          o ThingName

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about a wireless gateway

       The  following  get-wireless-gateway example gets information about the
       wireless gateway myFirstLoRaWANGateway.

          aws iotwireless get-wireless-gateway \
              --identifier "12345678-a1b2-3c45-67d8-e90fa1b2c34d" \
              --identifier-type WirelessGatewayId

       Output:

          {
              "Description": "My first LoRaWAN gateway",
              "ThingArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:thing/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-12ab345c67de",
              "LoRaWAN": {
                  "RfRegion": "US915",
                  "GatewayEui": "a1b2c3d4567890ab"
              },
              "ThingName": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-12ab345c67de",
              "Id": "12345678-a1b2-3c45-67d8-e90fa1b2c34d",
              "Arn": "arn:aws:iotwireless:us-east-1:123456789012:WirelessGateway/6c44ab31-8b4d-407a-bed3-19b6c7cda551",
              "Name": "myFirstLoRaWANGateway"
          }
