NAME
       get-log-levels-by-resource-types -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  current  default  log  levels or log levels by resource types.
       Based on resource types, log levels can  be  for  wireless  device  log
       options or wireless gateway log options.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-log-levels-by-resource-types
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       WirelessGatewayLogOptions -> (list)
          The list of wireless gateway log options.

          (structure)
              The log options for wireless gateways and can be used to set log
              levels for a specific type of wireless gateway.

              Type -> (string)
                 The wireless gateway type.

              LogLevel -> (string)

                 (structure)
                     The log options for a wireless gateway event and  can  be
                     used  to  set  log levels for a specific wireless gateway
                     event.

                     For a LoRaWAN gateway, possible events for a log  message
                     are CUPS_Request and Certificate .

                     Event -> (string)
                        The  event  for  a  log message, if the log message is
                        tied to a wireless gateway.

                     LogLevel -> (string)
                        The log level for a log message.

       WirelessDeviceLogOptions -> (list)
          The list of wireless device log options.

          (structure)
              The log options for wireless devices and can be used to set  log
              levels for a specific type of wireless device.

              Type -> (string)
                 The wireless device type.

              LogLevel -> (string)
                 The log level for a log message.

              Events -> (list)
                 The list of wireless device event log options.

                 (structure)
                     The  log  options  for a wireless device event and can be
                     used to set log levels for  a  specific  wireless  device
                     event.

                     For  a LoRaWAN device, possible events for a log messsage
                     are: Join , Rejoin , Downlink_Data ,  and  Uplink_Data  .
                     For  a Sidewalk device, possible events for a log message
                     are Registration , Downlink_Data , and Uplink_Data .

                     Event -> (string)
                        The event for a log message, if  the  log  message  is
                        tied to a wireless device.

                     LogLevel -> (string)
                        The log level for a log message.
