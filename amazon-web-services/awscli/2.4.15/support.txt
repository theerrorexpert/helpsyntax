DESCRIPTION
       The  Amazon Web Services Support API Reference is intended for program-
       mers who need detailed information about the Amazon Web  Services  Sup-
       port operations and data types. You can use the API to manage your sup-
       port cases programmatically. The Amazon Web Services Support  API  uses
       HTTP methods that return results in JSON format.

       NOTE:

          o You  must  have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Sup-
            port plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.

          o If you call the Amazon Web Services Support API  from  an  account
            that  does  not have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise
            Support  plan,  the  SubscriptionRequiredException  error  message
            appears.  For  information  about  changing your support plan, see
            Amazon Web Services Support .

       The Amazon Web Services Support service also exposes a set  of  Trusted
       Advisor  features. You can retrieve a list of checks and their descrip-
       tions, get check results,  specify  checks  to  refresh,  and  get  the
       refresh status of checks.

       The  following list describes the Amazon Web Services Support case man-
       agement operations:

       o Service names, issue categories, and available severity levels -  The
         DescribeServices and  DescribeSeverityLevels operations return Amazon
         Web Services service names, service codes,  service  categories,  and
         problem severity levels. You use these values when you call the  Cre-
         ateCase operation.

       o Case creation, case details, and case resolution - The  CreateCase  ,
         DescribeCases  ,   DescribeAttachment  ,  and  ResolveCase operations
         create Amazon Web Services Support cases, retrieve information  about
         cases, and resolve cases.

       o Case communication - The  DescribeCommunications ,  AddCommunication-
         ToCase , and  AddAttachmentsToSet operations retrieve and add  commu-
         nications and attachments to Amazon Web Services Support cases.

       The  following  list describes the operations available from the Amazon
       Web Services Support service for Trusted Advisor:

       o DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks returns the  list  of  checks  that  run
         against your Amazon Web Services resources.

       o Using  the  checkId  for  a  specific  check  returned  by  Describe-
         TrustedAdvisorChecks , you can  call   DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckRe-
         sult to obtain the results for the check that you specified.

       o DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckSummaries  returns  summarized results for
         one or more Trusted Advisor checks.

       o RefreshTrustedAdvisorCheck requests  that  Trusted  Advisor  rerun  a
         specified check.

       o DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatuses reports the refresh status
         of one or more checks.

       For authentication  of  requests,  Amazon  Web  Services  Support  uses
       Signature Version 4 Signing Process .
