LIST-TIME-SERIES()                                          LIST-TIME-SERIES()



NAME
       list-time-series -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a paginated list of time series (data streams).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-time-series  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: TimeSeriesSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-time-series
          [--asset-id <value>]
          [--alias-prefix <value>]
          [--time-series-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --asset-id (string)
          The ID of the asset in which the asset property was created.

       --alias-prefix (string)
          The alias prefix of the time series.

       --time-series-type (string)
          The type of the time series. The time series type can be one of  the
          following values:

          o ASSOCIATED   The time series is associated with an asset property.

          o DISASSOCIATED  The time series isn't  associated  with  any  asset
            property.

          Possible values:

          o ASSOCIATED

          o DISASSOCIATED

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TimeSeriesSummaries -> (list)
          One or more time series summaries to list.

          (structure)
              Contains a summary of a time series (data stream).

              assetId -> (string)
                 The ID of the asset in which the asset property was  created.

              propertyId -> (string)
                 The ID of the asset property.

              alias -> (string)
                 The alias that identifies the time series.

              timeSeriesId -> (string)
                 The ID of the time series.

              dataType -> (string)
                 The data type of the time series.

                 If you specify STRUCT , you must also specify dataTypeSpec to
                 identify the type of the structure for this time series.

              dataTypeSpec -> (string)
                 The data type of the structure for  this  time  series.  This
                 parameter  is  required  for time series that have the STRUCT
                 data type.

                 The options for this parameter depend on the type of the com-
                 posite  model in which you created the asset property that is
                 associated with your time  series.  Use  AWS/ALARM_STATE  for
                 alarm state in alarm composite models.

              timeSeriesCreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  that  the  time  series was created, in Unix epoch
                 time.

              timeSeriesLastUpdateDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date that the time series was last updated, in Unix epoch
                 time.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results, or null if there are no addi-
          tional results.
