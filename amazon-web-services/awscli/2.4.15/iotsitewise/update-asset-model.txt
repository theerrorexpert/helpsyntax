UPDATE-ASSET-MODEL()                                      UPDATE-ASSET-MODEL()



NAME
       update-asset-model -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates an asset model and all of the assets that were created from the
       model. Each asset created from the model  inherits  the  updated  asset
       model's  property  and hierarchy definitions. For more information, see
       Updating assets and models in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

       WARNING:
          This operation overwrites  the  existing  model  with  the  provided
          model.  To  avoid  deleting your asset model's properties or hierar-
          chies, you must include their IDs and  definitions  in  the  updated
          asset  model payload. For more information, see DescribeAssetModel .

          If you remove a property from an asset model, IoT  SiteWise  deletes
          all previous data for that property. If you remove a hierarchy defi-
          nition from an asset model, IoT SiteWise disassociates  every  asset
          associated  with  that  hierarchy. You can't change the type or data
          type of an existing property.

          (structure)
              Contains information about an asset model property.

              id -> (string)
                 The ID of the asset model property.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the asset model property.

              dataType -> (string)
                 The data type of the asset model property.

              dataTypeSpec -> (string)
                 The data type of the structure for this property. This param-
                 eter exists on properties that have the STRUCT data type.

              unit -> (string)
                 The  unit of the asset model property, such as Newtons or RPM
                 .

              type -> (structure)
                 The property type (see PropertyType ).

                 attribute -> (structure)
                     Specifies an asset attribute property. An attribute  gen-
                     erally  contains  static  information, such as the serial
                     number of an IIoT wind turbine.

                     defaultValue -> (string)
                        The  default  value  of  the  asset   model   property
                        attribute.  All  assets that you create from the asset
                        model contain this attribute value. You can update  an
                        attribute's  value after you create an asset. For more
                        information, see Updating attribute values in the  IoT
                        SiteWise User Guide .

                 measurement -> (structure)
                     Specifies  an  asset  measurement property. A measurement
                     represents a device's raw sensor  data  stream,  such  as
                     timestamped  temperature values or timestamped power val-
                     ues.

                        The processing configuration for the given measurement
                        property. You can configure measurements to be kept at
                        the edge or  forwarded  to  the  Amazon  Web  Services
                        Cloud.  By  default, measurements are forwarded to the
                        cloud.

                        forwardingConfig -> (structure)
                            The forwarding configuration for  the  given  mea-
                            surement property.

                            state -> (string)
                               The forwarding state for the given property.

                 transform -> (structure)
                     Specifies  an  asset transform property. A transform con-
                     tains a mathematical expression that  maps  a  property's
                     data points from one form to another, such as a unit con-
                     version from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

                     expression -> (string)
                        The mathematical expression that defines the transfor-
                        mation  function.  You  can specify up to 10 variables
                        per expression. You can specify up to 10 functions per
                        expression.

                        For  more  information, see Quotas in the IoT SiteWise
                        User Guide .

                     variables -> (list)
                        The list of variables used in the expression.

                        (structure)
                            Contains expression variable information.

                               The friendly name of the variable to be used in
                               the expression.

                            value -> (structure)
                               The  variable that identifies an asset property
                               from which to use values.

                               propertyId -> (string)
                                   The ID of the property to use as the  vari-
                                   able. You can use the property name if it's
                                   from the same asset model.

                               hierarchyId -> (string)
                                   The ID of the hierarchy to  query  for  the
                                   property  ID.  You  can use the hierarchy's
                                   name instead of the hierarchy's ID.

                                   You use a hierarchy ID instead of  a  model
                                   ID because you can have several hierarchies
                                   using the same model and therefore the same
                                   propertyId  .  For  example, you might have
                                   separately grouped assets  that  come  from
                                   the same asset model. For more information,
                                   see Asset hierarchies in the  IoT  SiteWise
                                   User Guide .

                     processingConfig -> (structure)
                        The  processing  configuration for the given transform
                        property. You can configure transforms to be  kept  at
                        the  edge  or  forwarded  to  the  Amazon Web Services
                        Cloud. You can also configure transforms  to  be  com-
                        puted at the edge or in the cloud.

                        computeLocation -> (string)

                 metric -> (structure)
                     Specifies  an  asset metric property. A metric contains a
                     mathematical expression that uses aggregate functions  to
                     process  all  input  data points over a time interval and
                     output a single data point,  such  as  to  calculate  the
                     average hourly temperature.

                     expression -> (string)
                        The  mathematical  expression  that defines the metric
                        aggregation function. You can specify up to  10  vari-
                        ables  per  expression. You can specify up to 10 func-
                        tions per expression.

                        User Guide .

                     variables -> (list)
                        The list of variables used in the expression.

                        (structure)
                            Contains expression variable information.

                            name -> (string)
                               The friendly name of the variable to be used in
                               the expression.

                            value -> (structure)
                               The variable that identifies an asset  property
                               from which to use values.

                               propertyId -> (string)
                                   The  ID of the property to use as the vari-
                                   able. You can use the property name if it's
                                   from the same asset model.

                               hierarchyId -> (string)
                                   The  ID  of  the hierarchy to query for the
                                   property ID. You can  use  the  hierarchy's
                                   name instead of the hierarchy's ID.

                                   You  use  a hierarchy ID instead of a model
                                   ID because you can have several hierarchies
                                   using the same model and therefore the same
                                   propertyId . For example,  you  might  have
                                   separately  grouped  assets  that come from
                                   the same asset model. For more information,
                                   see  Asset  hierarchies in the IoT SiteWise
                                   User Guide .

                     window -> (structure)
                        The window (time interval)  over  which  IoT  SiteWise
                        computes  the  metric's  aggregation  expression.  IoT
                        SiteWise computes one data point per window .

                        tumbling -> (structure)
                            The tumbling time interval window.

                            interval -> (string)
                               The time interval for the tumbling window.  The
                               interval  time  must  be between 1 minute and 1
                               week.

                               IoT SiteWise computes the 1w interval  the  end
                               of  Sunday  at midnight each week (UTC), the 1d
                               interval at the end of  each  day  at  midnight
                               (UTC), the 1h interval at the end of each hour,
                               and so on.

                               When IoT SiteWise aggregates  data  points  for
                               metric computations, the start of each interval
                               is exclusive and the end of  each  interval  is
                               inclusive.  IoT  SiteWise  places  the computed
                               data point at the end of the interval.

                            offset -> (string)
                               The offset for the tumbling window. The  offset
                               parameter accepts the following:

                               o The  offset time. For example, if you specify
                                 18h for offset and  1d  for  interval  ,  IoT
                                 SiteWise  aggregates  data in one of the fol-
                                 lowing ways:

                                 o If you create the metric before or at 6  PM
                                   (UTC), you get the first aggregation result
                                   at 6 PM (UTC) on the day  when  you  create
                                   the metric.

                                 o If  you create the metric after 6 PM (UTC),
                                   you get the first aggregation result  at  6
                                   PM (UTC) the next day.

                               o The  ISO  8601  format.  For  example, if you
                                 specify PT18H for offset and 1d for  interval
                                 ,  IoT SiteWise aggregates data in one of the
                                 following ways:

                                 o If you create the metric before or at 6  PM
                                   (UTC), you get the first aggregation result
                                   at 6 PM (UTC) on the day  when  you  create
                                   the metric.

                                 o If  you create the metric after 6 PM (UTC),
                                   you get the first aggregation result  at  6
                                   PM (UTC) the next day.

                               o The  24-hour clock. For example, if you spec-
                                 ify 00:03:00 for offset , 5m for  interval  ,
                                 and  you create the metric at 2 PM (UTC), you
                                 get the first aggregation result at  2:03  PM
                                 (UTC).  You get the second aggregation result
                                 at 2:08 PM (UTC).

                               o The offset time zone.  For  example,  if  you
                                 specify 2021-07-23T18:00-08 for offset and 1d
                                 for interval , IoT SiteWise  aggregates  data
                                 in one of the following ways:

                                 o If  you create the metric before or at 6 PM
                                   (PST), you get the first aggregation result
                                   at  6  PM  (PST) on the day when you create

                                          variable.  You  can use the property
                                          name if it's  from  the  same  asset
                                          model.

                                          hierarchy's   name  instead  of  the
                                          hierarchy's ID.

                                          You use a hierarchy ID instead of  a
                                          model  ID  because you can have sev-
                                          eral  hierarchies  using  the   same
                                          model and therefore the same proper-
                                          tyId . For example, you  might  have
                                          separately  grouped assets that come
                                          from the same asset model. For  more

                                      The variable that  identifies  an  asset
                                      property from which to use values.

                                      propertyId -> (string)
                                          The ID of the property to use as the
                                          variable. You can use  the  property
                                          name  if  it's  from  the same asset
                                          model.

                                      hierarchyId -> (string)
                                          The ID of the hierarchy to query for
                                          the  property  ID.  You  can use the
                                          hierarchy's  name  instead  of   the
                                          hierarchy's ID.

                                          You  use a hierarchy ID instead of a
                                          model ID because you can  have  sev-
                                          eral   hierarchies  using  the  same
                                          model and therefore the same proper-
                                          tyId  .  For example, you might have
                                          separately grouped assets that  come
                                          from  the same asset model. For more
                                          information, see  Asset  hierarchies
                                          in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

                            window -> (structure)
                               The window (time interval) over which IoT Site-
                               Wise computes the metric's aggregation  expres-
                               sion.  IoT SiteWise computes one data point per
                               window .

                               tumbling -> (structure)
                                   The tumbling time interval window.

                                   interval -> (string)
                                      The time interval for the tumbling  win-
                                      dow. The interval time must be between 1
                                      minute and 1 week.

                                      IoT SiteWise computes  the  1w  interval
                                      the  end of Sunday at midnight each week
                                      (UTC), the 1d interval  at  the  end  of
                                      each  day  at  midnight  (UTC),  the  1h
                                      interval at the end of each hour, and so
                                      on.

                                      When IoT SiteWise aggregates data points
                                      for metric computations,  the  start  of
                                      each  interval  is exclusive and the end
                                      of each interval is inclusive. IoT Site-
                                      Wise  places  the computed data point at
                                      the end of the interval.

                                   offset -> (string)
                                      The offset for the tumbling window.  The
                                      offset parameter accepts the following:

                                      o The  offset  time. For example, if you
                                        specify 18h  for  offset  and  1d  for
                                        interval  ,  IoT  SiteWise  aggregates
                                        data in one of the following ways:

                                        o If you create the metric  before  or
                                          at  6  PM  (UTC),  you get the first
                                          aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC)  on
                                          the  day when you create the metric.

                                        o If you create the metric after 6  PM
                                          (UTC), you get the first aggregation
                                          result at 6 PM (UTC) the next day.

                                      o The ISO 8601 format. For  example,  if
                                        you  specify  PT18H  for offset and 1d
                                        for interval , IoT SiteWise aggregates
                                        data in one of the following ways:

                                        o If  you  create the metric before or
                                          at 6 PM (UTC),  you  get  the  first
                                          aggregation  result at 6 PM (UTC) on
                                          the day when you create the  metric.

                                        o If  you create the metric after 6 PM
                                          (UTC), you get the first aggregation
                                          result at 6 PM (UTC) the next day.

                                      o The 24-hour clock. For example, if you
                                        specify 00:03:00 for offset ,  5m  for
                                        interval  ,  and you create the metric
                                        at 2  PM  (UTC),  you  get  the  first
                                        aggregation  result  at 2:03 PM (UTC).
                                        You get the second aggregation  result
                                        at 2:08 PM (UTC).

                                      o The  offset time zone. For example, if
                                        you  specify  2021-07-23T18:00-08  for
                                        offset and 1d for interval , IoT Site-
                                        Wise aggregates data  in  one  of  the
                                        following ways:

                                        o If  you  create the metric before or
                                          at 6 PM (PST),  you  get  the  first
                                          aggregation  result at 6 PM (PST) on
                                          the day when you create the  metric.

                                        o If  you create the metric after 6 PM
                                          (PST), you get the first aggregation
                                          result at 6 PM (PST) the next day.

                            processingConfig -> (structure)

                               ric property. You can configure metrics  to  be
                               computed  at the edge or in the Amazon Web Ser-
                               vices Cloud. By default, metrics are  forwarded
                               to the cloud.

                               computeLocation -> (string)
                                   The  compute  location for the given metric
                                   property.

       --client-token (string)
          A unique case-sensitive identifier that you can  provide  to  ensure
          the  idempotency  of the request. Don't reuse this client token if a
          new idempotent request is required.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To update an asset model

       The following update-asset-model example  updates  a  wind  farm  asset
       model's description. This example includes the model's existing IDs and
       definitions, because update-asset-model overwrites the  existing  model
       with the new model.
