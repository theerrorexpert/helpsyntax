DESCRIBE-ACCESS-POLICY()                              DESCRIBE-ACCESS-POLICY()



NAME
       describe-access-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  an access policy, which specifies an identity's access to an
       IoT SiteWise Monitor portal or project.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-access-policy
          --access-policy-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --access-policy-id (string)
          The ID of the access policy.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe an access policy

       The following describe-access-policy example describes an access policy
       that  grants  a  user  administrative access to a web portal for a wind
       farm company.

          aws iotsitewise describe-access-policy \
              --access-policy-id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-cccccEXAMPLE

       Output:

                  }
              },

                  "portal": {
                      "id": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-aaaaaEXAMPLE"
                  }
              },

              "accessPolicyCreationDate": "2020-02-20T22:35:15.552880124Z",
              "accessPolicyLastUpdateDate": "2020-02-20T22:35:15.552880124Z"
          }
