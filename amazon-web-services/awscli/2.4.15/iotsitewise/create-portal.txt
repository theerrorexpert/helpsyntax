CREATE-PORTAL()                                                CREATE-PORTAL()



NAME
       create-portal -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a portal, which can contain projects and dashboards. IoT Site-
       Wise Monitor uses Amazon Web Services SSO or IAM to authenticate portal
       users and manage user permissions.

       NOTE:
          Before  you  can  sign in to a new portal, you must add at least one
          identity to that portal. For more information, see Adding or  remov-
          ing portal administrators in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          The Amazon Web Services administrator's contact email address.

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique  case-sensitive  identifier that you can provide to ensure
          the idempotency of the request. Don't reuse this client token  if  a
          new idempotent request is required.

          A logo image to display in the portal. Upload a square, high-resolu-
          tion image. The image is displayed on a dark background.

          data -> (blob)
              The image file contents, represented as a base64-encoded string.
              The file size must be less than 1 MB.

          type -> (string)
              The file type of the image.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          data=blob,type=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "data": blob,
            "type": "PNG"
          }

       --role-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of a service role that allows the portal's users to access
          your IoT SiteWise resources on your behalf.  For  more  information,
          see Using service roles for IoT SiteWise Monitor in the IoT SiteWise
          User Guide .

       --tags (map)
          A list of key-value pairs that contain metadata for the portal.  For

            ...}

       --portal-auth-mode (string)
          The service to use to authenticate users to the portal. Choose  from
          the following options:

          o SSO  The portal uses Amazon Web Services Single Sign On to authen-
            ticate users and manage user permissions. Before you can create  a
            portal  that  uses Amazon Web Services SSO, you must enable Amazon
            Web Services SSO. For more information, see  Enabling  Amazon  Web
            Services  SSO in the IoT SiteWise User Guide . This option is only
            available in Amazon Web Services  Regions  other  than  the  China
            Regions.

          o IAM   The  portal uses Identity and Access Management to authenti-
            cate users and manage user permissions.

          You can't change this value after you create a portal.

          Default: SSO

          Possible values:

          o IAM

          o SSO

       --notification-sender-email (string)
          The email address that sends alarm notifications.

          WARNING:
              If you use the IoT Events managed Lambda function to manage your
              emails, you must verify the sender email address in Amazon SES .

       --alarms (structure)
          Contains the configuration information of an alarm created in an IoT
          SiteWise  Monitor  portal. You can use the alarm to monitor an asset
          property and get notified when the asset property value is outside a
          specified range. For more information, see Monitoring with alarms in
          the IoT SiteWise Application Guide .

          alarmRoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the IAM role that allows the alarm to perform actions
              and  access  Amazon Web Services resources and services, such as
              IoT Events.

          notificationLambdaArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the Lambda function that manages alarm notifications.
              For  more  information,  see Managing alarm notifications in the
              IoT Events Developer Guide .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          alarmRoleArn=string,notificationLambdaArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "alarmRoleArn": "string",
            "notificationLambdaArn": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a portal

       The following create-portal example creates a web  portal  for  a  wind
       farm  company. You can create portals only in the same Region where you
       enabled AWS Single Sign-On.

          aws iotsitewise create-portal \
              --portal-name WindFarmPortal \
              --portal-description "A portal that contains wind farm projects for Example Corp." \
              --portal-contact-email support@example.com \
              --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/service-role/MySiteWiseMonitorServiceRole

       Output:

          {
              "portalId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-aaaaaEXAMPLE",
              "portalArn": "arn:aws:iotsitewise:us-west-2:123456789012:portal/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-aaaaaEXAMPLE",
              "portalStartUrl": "https://a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-aaaaaEXAMPLE.app.iotsitewise.aws",
              "portalStatus": {
                  "state": "CREATING"
              },
              "ssoApplicationId": "ins-a1b2c3d4-EXAMPLE"
          }

          SiteWise console to get a URL that you can use to access the portal.

       portalStatus -> (structure)

              Contains associated error information, if any.

              code -> (string)
                 The error code.
