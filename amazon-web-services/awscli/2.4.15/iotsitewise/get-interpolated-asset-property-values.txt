NAME
       get-interpolated-asset-property-values -

DESCRIPTION
       Get  interpolated  values  for  an  asset property for a specified time
       interval, during a period of time. If your time series is missing  data
       points during the specified time interval, you can use interpolation to
       estimate the missing data.

       For example, you can use this operation to return the interpolated tem-
       perature  values for a wind turbine every 24 hours over a duration of 7
       days.

       To identify an asset property, you must specify one of the following:

       o The assetId and propertyId of an asset property.

       o A propertyAlias , which is a data stream alias  (for  example,  /com-
         pany/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temperature  ).  To  define  an asset prop-
         erty's alias, see UpdateAssetProperty .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-interpolated-asset-property-values is a paginated operation. Multi-
       ple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: interpolatedAssetPropertyValues

OPTIONS
       --asset-id (string)
          The ID of the asset.

       --property-id (string)
          The ID of the asset property.

       --property-alias (string)
          The  alias  that  identifies  the property, such as an OPC-UA server
          data stream path (for example, /company/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temper-
          ature  ).  For more information, see Mapping industrial data streams
          to asset properties in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

       --start-time-in-seconds (long)
          The exclusive start of the range from  which  to  interpolate  data,
          expressed in seconds in Unix epoch time.

       --start-time-offset-in-nanos (integer)
          The nanosecond offset converted from startTimeInSeconds .

       --end-time-in-seconds (long)
          The  inclusive  end  of  the  range  from which to interpolate data,
          expressed in seconds in Unix epoch time.

       --end-time-offset-in-nanos (integer)
          The nanosecond offset converted from endTimeInSeconds .

       --quality (string)
          The quality of the asset property value. You can use this  parameter
          as  a  filter  to  choose only the asset property values that have a
          specific quality.

          Possible values:

          o GOOD

          o BAD

          o UNCERTAIN

       --interval-in-seconds (long)
          The time interval in seconds over which to  interpolate  data.  Each
          interval starts when the previous one ends.

       --type (string)
          The interpolation type.

          Valid values: LINEAR_INTERPOLATION | LOCF_INTERPOLATION

          o LINEAR_INTERPOLATION  Estimates missing data using linear interpo-
            lation . For example, you can use this  operation  to  return  the
            interpolated  temperature values for a wind turbine every 24 hours
            over a duration of 7 days. If the  interpolation  starts  July  1,
            2021,  at  9 AM, IoT SiteWise returns the first interpolated value
            on July 2, 2021, at 9 AM, the second interpolated value on July 3,
            2021, at 9 AM, and so on.

          o LOCF_INTERPOLATION   Estimates missing data using last observation
            carried forward interpolation If no data point  is  found  for  an
            interval,  IoT  SiteWise  returns the last observed data point for
            the previous interval and carries forward this interpolated  value
            until  a  new  data  point  is found. For example, you can get the
            state of an on-off valve every 24 hours over a duration of 7 days.
            If  the  interpolation  starts July 1, 2021, at 9 AM, IoT SiteWise
            returns the last observed data point between July 1, 2021, at 9 AM
            and  July  2,  2021, at 9 AM as the first interpolated value. If a
            data point isn't found after 9 AM on July 2,  2021,  IoT  SiteWise
            uses the same interpolated value for the rest of the days.

       --interval-window-in-seconds (long)
          The query interval for the window, in seconds. IoT SiteWise computes
          each interpolated value by using data points from the  timestamp  of
          each  interval,  minus  the window to the timestamp of each interval
          plus the window. If not specified, the  window  ranges  between  the
          start time minus the interval and the end time plus the interval.

          NOTE:

              o If you specify a value for the intervalWindowInSeconds parame-
                ter, the value for the type parameter must be  LINEAR_INTERPO-
                LATION .

              o If a data point isn't found during the specified query window,
                IoT SiteWise won't return an interpolated value for the inter-
                val.  This  indicates  that there's a gap in the ingested data
                points.

          For example, you can get the interpolated temperature values  for  a
          wind turbine every 24 hours over a duration of 7 days. If the inter-
          polation starts on July 1, 2021, at 9 AM with a window of  2  hours,
          IoT  SiteWise uses the data points from 7 AM (9 AM minus 2 hours) to
          11 AM (9 AM plus 2 hours) on July  2,  2021  to  compute  the  first
          interpolated  value.  Next, IoT SiteWise uses the data points from 7
          AM (9 AM minus 2 hours) to 11 AM (9 AM plus 2 hours) on July 3, 2021
          to compute the second interpolated value, and so on.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
