DESCRIBE-GATEWAY()                                          DESCRIBE-GATEWAY()



NAME
       describe-gateway -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information about a gateway.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-gateway
          --gateway-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-id (string)
          The ID of the gateway device.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe a gateway

       The following describe-gateway example describes a gateway.

          aws iotsitewise describe-gateway \
              --gateway-id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-1a1a1EXAMPLE

                      "capabilitySyncStatus": "IN_SYNC"
                  }

OUTPUT
       gatewayId -> (string)
          The ID of the gateway device.

       gatewayName -> (string)
          The name of the gateway.

       gatewayArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the gateway, which has the following format.
              arn:${Partition}:iotsitewise:${Region}:${Account}:gate-
              way/${GatewayId}

       gatewayPlatform -> (structure)
          The gateway's platform.

          greengrass -> (structure)
              A gateway that runs on IoT Greengrass.

              groupArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of the Greengrass group. For more information about
                 how to find a group's ARN, see ListGroups and GetGroup in the
                 IoT Greengrass API Reference .

          greengrassV2 -> (structure)
              A gateway that runs on IoT Greengrass V2.

              coreDeviceThingName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  IoT thing for your IoT Greengrass V2 core
                 device.

       gatewayCapabilitySummaries -> (list)
          A list of gateway capability summaries that each contain a namespace
          and  status.  Each  gateway  capability defines data sources for the
          gateway. To retrieve a capability  configuration's  definition,  use
          DescribeGatewayCapabilityConfiguration .

          (structure)
              Contains a summary of a gateway capability configuration.

              capabilityNamespace -> (string)
                 The  namespace  of the capability configuration. For example,
                 if you configure OPC-UA sources from the  IoT  SiteWise  con-
                 sole,  your OPC-UA capability configuration has the namespace
                 iotsitewise:opcuacollector:version , where version is a  num-
                 ber such as 1 .

              capabilitySyncStatus -> (string)
                 The  synchronization  status of the capability configuration.
                 The sync status can be one of the following:

                 o IN_SYNC  The gateway is running the  capability  configura-
                   tion.

                 o OUT_OF_SYNC   The  gateway  hasn't  received the capability
                   configuration.

                 o SYNC_FAILED  The gateway rejected the capability configura-
                   tion.

       creationDate -> (timestamp)
          The date the gateway was created, in Unix epoch time.

       lastUpdateDate -> (timestamp)
          The date the gateway was last updated, in Unix epoch time.
