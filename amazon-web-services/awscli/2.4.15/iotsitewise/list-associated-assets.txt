LIST-ASSOCIATED-ASSETS()                              LIST-ASSOCIATED-ASSETS()



NAME
       list-associated-assets -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a paginated list of associated assets.

       You can use this operation to do the following:

       o List  child  assets  associated to a parent asset by a hierarchy that
         you specify.

       o List an asset's parent asset.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-associated-assets is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: assetSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-associated-assets
          --asset-id <value>
          [--hierarchy-id <value>]
          [--traversal-direction <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --asset-id (string)
          The ID of the asset to query.

       --hierarchy-id (string)
          The  ID of the hierarchy by which child assets are associated to the
          asset.  To  find  a  hierarchy  ID,   use   the   DescribeAsset   or
          DescribeAssetModel  operations.  This  parameter  is required if you
          choose CHILD for traversalDirection .

          For more information, see Asset hierarchies in the IoT SiteWise User
          Guide .

       --traversal-direction (string)
          The direction to list associated assets. Choose one of the following
          options:

          o CHILD  The list includes all child assets associated to the asset.
            The hierarchyId parameter is required if you choose CHILD .

          o PARENT  The list includes the asset's parent asset.

          Default: CHILD

          Possible values:

          o PARENT

          o CHILD

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
