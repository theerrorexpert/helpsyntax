DESCRIBE-TIME-SERIES()                                  DESCRIBE-TIME-SERIES()



NAME
       describe-time-series -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information about a time series (data stream).

       To identify a time series, do one of the following:

       o If  the  time series isn't associated with an asset property, specify
         the alias of the time series.

       o If the time series is associated with an asset property, specify  one
         of the following:

         o The alias of the time series.

         o The assetId and propertyId that identifies the asset property.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-time-series
          [--alias <value>]
          [--asset-id <value>]
          [--property-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --alias (string)
          The alias that identifies the time series.

       --asset-id (string)
          The ID of the asset in which the asset property was created.

       --property-id (string)
          The ID of the asset property.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       assetId -> (string)
          The ID of the asset in which the asset property was created.

       propertyId -> (string)
          The ID of the asset property.

       alias -> (string)
          The alias that identifies the time series.

       timeSeriesId -> (string)
          The ID of the time series.

       dataType -> (string)
          The data type of the time series.

          If  you specify STRUCT , you must also specify dataTypeSpec to iden-
          tify the type of the structure for this time series.

       dataTypeSpec -> (string)
          The data type of the structure for this time series. This  parameter
          is required for time series that have the STRUCT data type.

          The  options  for this parameter depend on the type of the composite
          model in which you created the asset  property  that  is  associated
          with  your time series. Use AWS/ALARM_STATE for alarm state in alarm
          composite models.

       timeSeriesCreationDate -> (timestamp)
          The date that the time series was created, in Unix epoch time.

       timeSeriesLastUpdateDate -> (timestamp)
          The date that the time series was last updated, in Unix epoch  time.
