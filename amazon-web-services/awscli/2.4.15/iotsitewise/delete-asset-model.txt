DELETE-ASSET-MODEL()                                      DELETE-ASSET-MODEL()



NAME
       delete-asset-model -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  an  asset  model. This action can't be undone. You must delete
       all assets created from an asset model before you can delete the model.
       Also,  you  can't  delete an asset model if a parent asset model exists
       that contains a property formula expression that depends on  the  asset
       model  that  you  want  to  delete.  For more information, see Deleting
       assets and models in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-asset-model
          --asset-model-id <value>
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --asset-model-id (string)
          The ID of the asset model to delete.

       --client-token (string)
          A unique case-sensitive identifier that you can  provide  to  ensure
          the  idempotency  of the request. Don't reuse this client token if a
          new idempotent request is required.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete an asset model

       The following delete-asset-model example deletes a wind  turbine  asset
       model.

          aws iotsitewise delete-asset-model \
              --asset-model-id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-11111EXAMPLE

              }
          }
