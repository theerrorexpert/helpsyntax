GET-ASSET-PROPERTY-AGGREGATES()                GET-ASSET-PROPERTY-AGGREGATES()



NAME
       get-asset-property-aggregates -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets aggregated values for an asset property. For more information, see
       Querying aggregates in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

       To identify an asset property, you must specify one of the following:

       o The assetId and propertyId of an asset property.

       o A propertyAlias , which is a data stream alias  (for  example,  /com-
         pany/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temperature  ).  To  define  an asset prop-
         erty's alias, see UpdateAssetProperty .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-asset-property-aggregates is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: aggregatedValues

          The ID of the asset.

       --property-id (string)
          The ID of the asset property.

       --property-alias (string)
          The  alias  that  identifies  the property, such as an OPC-UA server
          data stream path (for example, /company/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temper-
          ature  ).  For more information, see Mapping industrial data streams
          to asset properties in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

       --aggregate-types (list)
          The data aggregating function.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            AVERAGE
            COUNT
            MAXIMUM
            MINIMUM
            SUM
            STANDARD_DEVIATION

       --resolution (string)
          The time interval over which to aggregate data.

       --qualities (list)
          The quality by which to filter asset data.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            GOOD
            BAD
            UNCERTAIN

       --start-date (timestamp)
          The exclusive start of the range  from  which  to  query  historical
          data, expressed in seconds in Unix epoch time.

       --end-date (timestamp)
          The  inclusive end of the range from which to query historical data,
          expressed in seconds in Unix epoch time.

       --time-ordering (string)
          The chronological sorting order of the requested information.

          Default: ASCENDING

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve an asset property's aggregated average and count values

       The  following  get-asset-property-aggregates  example retrieves a wind
       turbine asset's average total power  and  count  of  total  power  data
       points for a 1 hour period in time.

          aws iotsitewise get-asset-property-aggregates \

              --property-id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-66666EXAMPLE \
              --start-date 1580849400 \

              --aggregate-types AVERAGE COUNT \
              --resolution 1h

       Output:

          {
              "aggregatedValues": [
                  {
                      "timestamp": 1580850000.0,
