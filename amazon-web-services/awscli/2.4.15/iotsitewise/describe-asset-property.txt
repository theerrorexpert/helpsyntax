DESCRIBE-ASSET-PROPERTY()                            DESCRIBE-ASSET-PROPERTY()



NAME
       describe-asset-property -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information about an asset property.

       NOTE:
          When  you  call  this  operation  for  an  attribute  property, this
          response includes the default attribute value that you define in the
          asset  model.  If  you  update  the default value in the model, this
          operation's response includes the new default value.

       This operation doesn't return the value of the asset property.  To  get
       the value of an asset property, use GetAssetPropertyValue .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-asset-property
          --asset-id <value>
          --property-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --asset-id (string)
          The ID of the asset.

       --property-id (string)
          The ID of the asset property.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          The ID of the asset model.

       assetProperty -> (structure)
          The asset property's definition, alias, and notification state.

          This  response  includes this object for normal asset properties. If
          you describe an asset property in a composite model,  this  response
          includes the asset property information in compositeModel .

          id -> (string)
              The ID of the asset property.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the property.

          alias -> (string)
              The alias that identifies the property, such as an OPC-UA server
              data  stream   path   (for   example,   /company/windfarm/3/tur-
              bine/7/temperature  ).  For more information, see Mapping indus-
              trial data streams to asset properties in the IoT SiteWise  User
              Guide .

          notification -> (structure)
              The  asset  property's  notification  topic  and state. For more
              information, see UpdateAssetProperty .

              topic -> (string)
                 The MQTT topic to which IoT SiteWise publishes property value
                 update notifications.

              state -> (string)
                 The current notification state.

          dataType -> (string)
              The property data type.

          unit -> (string)
              The unit (such as Newtons or RPM ) of the asset property.

          type -> (structure)
              The  property  type (see PropertyType ). A property contains one
              type.

              attribute -> (structure)
                 Specifies an asset attribute property. An attribute generally
                 contains  static information, such as the serial number of an
                 IIoT wind turbine.

                 defaultValue -> (string)
                     The default value of the asset model property  attribute.
                     All  assets  that you create from the asset model contain
                     this attribute value. You can update an attribute's value
                     after  you  create  an  asset.  For more information, see
                     Updating attribute values in the IoT SiteWise User  Guide
                     .

              measurement -> (structure)
                 Specifies an asset measurement property. A measurement repre-
                 sents a device's raw sensor data stream, such as  timestamped
                 temperature values or timestamped power values.

                 processingConfig -> (structure)
                     The  processing  configuration  for the given measurement
                     property. You can configure measurements to  be  kept  at
                     the  edge  or forwarded to the Amazon Web Services Cloud.
                     By default, measurements are forwarded to the cloud.

                     forwardingConfig -> (structure)
                        The forwarding configuration for the given measurement
                        property.

                            The forwarding state for the given property.

              transform -> (structure)
                 Specifies an asset transform property. A transform contains a
                 mathematical expression that maps a  property's  data  points
                 from one form to another, such as a unit conversion from Cel-
                 sius to Fahrenheit.

                 expression -> (string)
                     The mathematical expression that defines the  transforma-
                     tion  function.  You  can  specify up to 10 variables per
                     expression. You  can  specify  up  to  10  functions  per
                     expression.

                     For more information, see Quotas in the IoT SiteWise User
                     Guide .

                 variables -> (list)
                     The list of variables used in the expression.

                     (structure)
                        Contains expression variable information.

                        name -> (string)
                            The friendly name of the variable to  be  used  in
                            the expression.

                        value -> (structure)
                            The  variable  that  identifies  an asset property
                            from which to use values.

                            propertyId -> (string)
                               The ID of the property to use as the  variable.
                               You  can use the property name if it's from the
                               same asset model.

                            hierarchyId -> (string)
                               The ID of the hierarchy to query for the  prop-
                               erty  ID.  You  can  use  the  hierarchy's name
                               instead of the hierarchy's ID.

                               You use a hierarchy ID instead of  a  model  ID
                               because  you can have several hierarchies using
                               the same model and therefore the  same  proper-
                               tyId  .  For example, you might have separately
                               grouped assets that come from  the  same  asset
                               model.  For more information, see Asset hierar-
                               chies in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

                 processingConfig -> (structure)
                     The processing  configuration  for  the  given  transform
                     property.  You can configure transforms to be kept at the
                     edge or forwarded to the Amazon Web Services  Cloud.  You
                     can  also configure transforms to be computed at the edge
                     or in the cloud.

                     computeLocation -> (string)
                        The compute location for the given transform property.

                     forwardingConfig -> (structure)
                        The forwarding configuration for a given property.

                        state -> (string)
                            The forwarding state for the given property.

              metric -> (structure)
                 Specifies an asset metric property. A metric contains a math-
                 ematical expression that uses aggregate functions to  process
                 all  input data points over a time interval and output a sin-
                 gle data point, such as to calculate the average hourly  tem-
                 perature.

                 expression -> (string)
                     The  mathematical  expression  that  defines  the  metric
                     aggregation function. You can specify up to 10  variables
                     per  expression.  You  can specify up to 10 functions per
                     expression.

                     For more information, see Quotas in the IoT SiteWise User
                     Guide .

                 variables -> (list)
                     The list of variables used in the expression.

                     (structure)
                        Contains expression variable information.

                        name -> (string)
                            The  friendly  name  of the variable to be used in
                            the expression.

                        value -> (structure)
                            The variable that  identifies  an  asset  property
                            from which to use values.

                            propertyId -> (string)
                               The  ID of the property to use as the variable.
                               You can use the property name if it's from  the
                               same asset model.

                            hierarchyId -> (string)
                               The  ID of the hierarchy to query for the prop-
                               erty ID.  You  can  use  the  hierarchy's  name
                               instead of the hierarchy's ID.

                               You  use  a  hierarchy ID instead of a model ID
                               because you can have several hierarchies  using
                               the  same  model and therefore the same proper-
                               tyId . For example, you might  have  separately
                               grouped  assets  that  come from the same asset
                               model. For more information, see Asset  hierar-
                               chies in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

                 window -> (structure)
                     The  window  (time interval) over which IoT SiteWise com-
                     putes the metric's aggregation expression.  IoT  SiteWise
                     computes one data point per window .

                     tumbling -> (structure)
                        The tumbling time interval window.

                        interval -> (string)
                            The  time  interval  for  the tumbling window. The
                            interval time must be between 1 minute and 1 week.

                            IoT  SiteWise  computes the 1w interval the end of
                            Sunday at midnight each week (UTC), the 1d  inter-
                            val  at the end of each day at midnight (UTC), the
                            1h interval at the end of each hour, and so on.

                            When IoT SiteWise aggregates data points for  met-
                            ric  computations,  the  start of each interval is
                            exclusive and the end of each interval  is  inclu-
                            sive.  IoT SiteWise places the computed data point
                            at the end of the interval.

                        offset -> (string)
                            The offset for the  tumbling  window.  The  offset
                            parameter accepts the following:

                            o The offset time. For example, if you specify 18h
                              for offset and 1d for interval  ,  IoT  SiteWise
                              aggregates data in one of the following ways:

                              o If  you  create  the  metric before or at 6 PM
                                (UTC), you get the first aggregation result at
                                6 PM (UTC) on the day when you create the met-
                                ric.

                              o If you create the metric after 6 PM (UTC), you
                                get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC)
                                the next day.

                            o The ISO 8601 format. For example, if you specify
                              PT18H for offset and 1d for interval , IoT Site-
                              Wise aggregates data in  one  of  the  following
                              ways:

                              o If  you  create  the  metric before or at 6 PM
                                (UTC), you get the first aggregation result at
                                6 PM (UTC) on the day when you create the met-
                                ric.

                              o If you create the metric after 6 PM (UTC), you
                                get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC)
                                the next day.

                            o The 24-hour clock. For example, if  you  specify
                              00:03:00  for offset , 5m for interval , and you
                              create the metric at 2 PM  (UTC),  you  get  the
                              first  aggregation  result at 2:03 PM (UTC). You
                              get the second aggregation  result  at  2:08  PM
                              (UTC).

                            o The  offset time zone. For example, if you spec-
                              ify 2021-07-23T18:00-08 for offset  and  1d  for
                              interval  ,  IoT SiteWise aggregates data in one
                              of the following ways:

                              o If you create the metric before  or  at  6  PM
                                (PST), you get the first aggregation result at
                                6 PM (PST) on the day when you create the met-
                                ric.

                              o If you create the metric after 6 PM (PST), you
                                get the first aggregation result at 6 PM (PST)
                                the next day.

                     number of an IIoT wind turbine.

                     defaultValue -> (string)
                        The  default  value  of  the  asset   model   property
                        attribute.  All  assets that you create from the asset
                        model contain this attribute value. You can update  an
                        attribute's  value after you create an asset. For more
                        information, see Updating attribute values in the  IoT

                 transform -> (structure)
                     Specifies  an  asset transform property. A transform con-
                     tains a mathematical expression that  maps  a  property's
                     data points from one form to another, such as a unit con-
                     version from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

                     expression -> (string)
                        The mathematical expression that defines the transfor-
                        mation  function.  You  can specify up to 10 variables
                        per expression. You can specify up to 10 functions per
                        expression.

                                   The ID of the property to use as the  vari-
                                   able. You can use the property name if it's
                                   from the same asset model.

                               hierarchyId -> (string)
                                   The ID of the hierarchy to  query  for  the
                                   property  ID.  You  can use the hierarchy's
                                   name instead of the hierarchy's ID.

                                   You use a hierarchy ID instead of  a  model
                                   ID because you can have several hierarchies
                                   using the same model and therefore the same
                                   propertyId  .  For  example, you might have
                                   separately grouped assets  that  come  from
                                   the same asset model. For more information,

                 metric -> (structure)
                     Specifies  an  asset metric property. A metric contains a
                     mathematical expression that uses aggregate functions  to
                     process  all  input  data points over a time interval and
                     output a single data point,  such  as  to  calculate  the
                     average hourly temperature.

                     expression -> (string)
                        The  mathematical  expression  that defines the metric
                        aggregation function. You can specify up to  10  vari-
                        ables  per  expression. You can specify up to 10 func-
                        tions per expression.

                               The variable that identifies an asset  property
                               from which to use values.

                               propertyId -> (string)
                                   The  ID of the property to use as the vari-
                                   able. You can use the property name if it's
                                   from the same asset model.

                               hierarchyId -> (string)
                                   The  ID  of  the hierarchy to query for the
                                   property ID. You can  use  the  hierarchy's
                                   name instead of the hierarchy's ID.

                                   You  use  a hierarchy ID instead of a model
                                   ID because you can have several hierarchies
                                   using the same model and therefore the same
                                   propertyId . For example,  you  might  have
                                   separately  grouped  assets  that come from
                                   the same asset model. For more information,
                                   see  Asset  hierarchies in the IoT SiteWise
                                   User Guide .

                     window -> (structure)
                        The window (time interval)  over  which  IoT  SiteWise
                        computes  the  metric's  aggregation  expression.  IoT
                        SiteWise computes one data point per window .

                        tumbling -> (structure)
                            The tumbling time interval window.

                            interval -> (string)
                               The time interval for the tumbling window.  The
                               interval  time  must  be between 1 minute and 1
                               week.

                               IoT SiteWise computes the 1w interval  the  end
                               of  Sunday  at midnight each week (UTC), the 1d
                               interval at the end of  each  day  at  midnight
                               (UTC), the 1h interval at the end of each hour,
                               and so on.

                               When IoT SiteWise aggregates  data  points  for
                               metric computations, the start of each interval
                               is exclusive and the end of  each  interval  is
                               inclusive.  IoT  SiteWise  places  the computed
                               data point at the end of the interval.

                            offset -> (string)
                               The offset for the tumbling window. The  offset
                               parameter accepts the following:

                               o The  offset time. For example, if you specify
                                 18h for offset and  1d  for  interval  ,  IoT
                                 SiteWise  aggregates  data in one of the fol-
                                 lowing ways:

                                 o If you create the metric before or at 6  PM
                                   (UTC), you get the first aggregation result
                                   at 6 PM (UTC) on the day  when  you  create
                                   the metric.

                                 o If  you create the metric after 6 PM (UTC),
                                   you get the first aggregation result  at  6
                                   PM (UTC) the next day.

                               o The  ISO  8601  format.  For  example, if you
                                 specify PT18H for offset and 1d for  interval
                                 ,  IoT SiteWise aggregates data in one of the
                                 following ways:

                                 o If you create the metric before or at 6  PM
                                   (UTC), you get the first aggregation result
                                   at 6 PM (UTC) on the day  when  you  create
                                   the metric.

                                 o If  you create the metric after 6 PM (UTC),
                                   you get the first aggregation result  at  6
                                   PM (UTC) the next day.

                               o The  24-hour clock. For example, if you spec-
                                 ify 00:03:00 for offset , 5m for  interval  ,
                                 and  you create the metric at 2 PM (UTC), you
                                 get the first aggregation result at  2:03  PM
                                 (UTC).  You get the second aggregation result
                                 at 2:08 PM (UTC).

                               o The offset time zone.  For  example,  if  you
                                 specify 2021-07-23T18:00-08 for offset and 1d
                                 for interval , IoT SiteWise  aggregates  data
                                 in one of the following ways:

                                 o If  you create the metric before or at 6 PM
                                   (PST), you get the first aggregation result
                                   at  6  PM  (PST) on the day when you create
                                   the metric.

                                 o If you create the metric after 6 PM  (PST),
                                   you  get  the first aggregation result at 6
                                   PM (PST) the next day.

                     processingConfig -> (structure)
                        The processing  configuration  for  the  given  metric
                        property.  You can configure metrics to be computed at
                        the edge or in  the  Amazon  Web  Services  Cloud.  By
                        default, metrics are forwarded to the cloud.

                        computeLocation -> (string)
                            The  compute  location  for the given metric prop-
