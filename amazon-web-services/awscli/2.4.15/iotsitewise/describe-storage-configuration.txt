NAME
       describe-storage-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information about the storage configuration for IoT SiteWise.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-storage-configuration
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       storageType -> (string)
          The storage tier that you specified for your data.  The  storageType
          parameter can be one of the following values:

          o SITEWISE_DEFAULT_STORAGE   IoT  SiteWise  saves your data into the
            hot tier. The hot tier is a service-managed database.

          o MULTI_LAYER_STORAGE  IoT SiteWise saves your data in both the cold
            tier and the cold tier. The cold tier is a customer-managed Amazon
            S3 bucket.

       multiLayerStorage -> (structure)
          Contains information about the storage destination.

          customerManagedS3Storage -> (structure)
              Contains information about a customer managed Amazon S3  bucket.

              s3ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of the Amazon S3 object. For more information about
                 how to find the ARN for an Amazon S3 object,  see  Amazon  S3
                 resources in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide .

              roleArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of  the  Identity  and  Access Management role that
                 allows IoT SiteWise to send data to Amazon S3.

       disassociatedDataStorage -> (string)
          Contains the storage configuration for time  series  (data  streams)
          that  aren't  associated  with  asset properties. The disassociated-
          DataStorage can be one of the following values:

          o ENABLED  IoT SiteWise accepts time series that  aren't  associated
            with asset properties.

          WARNING:
              After the disassociatedDataStorage is enabled, you can't disable
              it.

          o DISABLED  IoT SiteWise doesn't accept time series  (data  streams)
            that aren't associated with asset properties.

          For  more  information,  see  Data  streams in the IoT SiteWise User
          Guide .

       retentionPeriod -> (structure)
          How many days your data is kept in the hot tier.  By  default,  your
          data is kept indefinitely in the hot tier.

          numberOfDays -> (integer)
              The number of days that your data is kept.

              NOTE:
                 If  you  specified  a value for this parameter, the unlimited
                 parameter must be false .

          unlimited -> (boolean)
              If true, your data is kept indefinitely.

              NOTE:
                 If configured to true , you must not specify a value for  the
                 numberOfDays parameter.

       configurationStatus -> (structure)
          Contains current status information for the configuration.

          state -> (string)
              The current state of the configuration.

          error -> (structure)
              Contains associated error information, if any.

              code -> (string)
                 The error code.

              message -> (string)
                 The error message.

       lastUpdateDate -> (timestamp)
          The  date  the storage configuration was last updated, in Unix epoch
          time.
