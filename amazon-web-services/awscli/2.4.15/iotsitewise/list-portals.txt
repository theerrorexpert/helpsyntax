LIST-PORTALS()                                                  LIST-PORTALS()



NAME
       list-portals -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a paginated list of IoT SiteWise Monitor portals.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-portals is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: portalSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-portals
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list all portals

       The  following  list-portals example lists all portals that are defined
       in your AWS account in the current Region.

          aws iotsitewise list-portals

       Output:

          {
              "portalSummaries": [
                  {
                      "id": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-aaaaaEXAMPLE",
                      "name": "WindFarmPortal",
                      "description": "A portal that contains wind farm projects for Example Corp.",
                      "startUrl": "https://a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-aaaaaEXAMPLE.app.iotsitewise.aws",

OUTPUT
       portalSummaries -> (list)
          A list that summarizes each portal.

          (structure)
              Contains a portal summary.

              id -> (string)
                 The ID of the portal.

              name -> (string)

              startUrl -> (string)
                 The URL for the IoT SiteWise Monitor portal. You can use this
                 URL to access portals that use Amazon Web  Services  SSO  for
                 authentication.  For portals that use IAM for authentication,
                 you must use the IoT SiteWise console to get a URL  that  you
                 can use to access the portal.

              creationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date the portal was created, in Unix epoch time.

              lastUpdateDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date the portal was last updated, in Unix epoch time.

              roleArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the service role that allows the portal's users to
                 access your IoT SiteWise resources on your behalf.  For  more
                 information, see Using service roles for IoT SiteWise Monitor
                 in the IoT SiteWise User Guide .

              status -> (structure)
                 Contains information about the current status of a portal.

                 state -> (string)

                 error -> (structure)
                     Contains associated error information, if any.

                     code -> (string)
                        The error code.

                     message -> (string)
                        The error message.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results, or null if there are no addi-
          tional results.
