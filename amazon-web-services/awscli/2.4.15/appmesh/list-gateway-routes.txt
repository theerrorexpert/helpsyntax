LIST-GATEWAY-ROUTES()                                    LIST-GATEWAY-ROUTES()



NAME
       list-gateway-routes -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of existing gateway routes that are associated to a vir-
       tual gateway.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-gateway-routes is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: gatewayRoutes

SYNOPSIS
            list-gateway-routes
          --mesh-name <value>
          [--mesh-owner <value>]
          --virtual-gateway-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --mesh-name (string)
          The name of the service mesh to list gateway routes in.

       --mesh-owner (string)
          The  AWS IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If the account ID
          is not your own, then it's the ID of the  account  that  shared  the
          mesh with your account. For more information about mesh sharing, see
          Working with shared meshes .

       --virtual-gateway-name (string)
          The name of the virtual gateway to list gateway routes in.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       gatewayRoutes -> (list)
          The  list  of existing gateway routes for the specified service mesh
          and virtual gateway.

          (structure)
              An object that represents a gateway route  returned  by  a  list
              operation.

              arn -> (string)
                 The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the gateway route.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The Unix epoch timestamp in seconds for when the resource was
                 created.

              gatewayRouteName -> (string)
                 The name of the gateway route.

              lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The Unix epoch timestamp in seconds for when the resource was
                 last updated.

              meshName -> (string)
                 The name of the service mesh that the resource resides in.

              meshOwner -> (string)
                 The  AWS  IAM  account  ID  of the service mesh owner. If the
                 account ID is not your own, then it's the ID of  the  account
                 that  shared the mesh with your account. For more information
                 about mesh sharing, see Working with shared meshes .

              resourceOwner -> (string)
                 The AWS IAM account ID of the resource owner. If the  account
                 ID  is not your own, then it's the ID of the mesh owner or of
                 another account that the mesh is shared with. For more infor-
                 mation about mesh sharing, see Working with shared meshes .

              version -> (long)
                 The version of the resource. Resources are created at version
                 1, and this version is incremented  each  time  that  they're
                 updated.

              virtualGatewayName -> (string)
                 The  virtual  gateway  that  the  gateway route is associated
                 with.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  nextToken  value  to  include  in  a  future  ListGatewayRoutes
          request.  When  the  results  of  a ListGatewayRoutes request exceed
          limit , you can use this value to retrieve the next page of results.
          This value is null when there are no more results to return.
