DELETE-VIRTUAL-ROUTER()                                DELETE-VIRTUAL-ROUTER()



NAME
       delete-virtual-router -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes an existing virtual router.

       You  must  delete  any routes associated with the virtual router before
       you can delete the router itself.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-virtual-router
          --mesh-name <value>
          [--mesh-owner <value>]
          --virtual-router-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --mesh-name (string)
          The name of the service mesh to delete the virtual router in.

       --mesh-owner (string)
          The AWS IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If the account  ID
          is  not  your  own,  then it's the ID of the account that shared the
          mesh with your account. For more information about mesh sharing, see
          Working with shared meshes .

       --virtual-router-name (string)
          The name of the virtual router to delete.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a virtual router

       The  following delete-virtual-router example deletes the specified vir-
       tual router.

          aws appmesh delete-virtual-router \
              --mesh-name app1 \
              --virtual-router-name vrServiceB
