SYNOPSIS
            update-virtual-router
          [--client-token <value>]
          --mesh-name <value>
          [--mesh-owner <value>]
          --spec <value>
          --virtual-router-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive  identifier  that  you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. Up to 36 letters, numbers, hyphens,  and
          underscores are allowed.

       --mesh-name (string)
          The name of the service mesh that the virtual router resides in.

       --mesh-owner (string)
          The  AWS IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If the account ID
          is not your own, then it's the ID of the  account  that  shared  the
          mesh with your account. For more information about mesh sharing, see
          Working with shared meshes .

       --spec (structure)
          The new virtual router specification to apply. This  overwrites  the
          existing data.

          listeners -> (list)
              The  listeners  that  the  virtual router is expected to receive
              inbound traffic from. You can specify one listener.

              (structure)
                 An object that represents a virtual router listener.

                 portMapping -> (structure)
                     An object that represents a port mapping.

                     port -> (integer)
                        The port used for the port mapping.

                     protocol -> (string)
                        The protocol used for the port  mapping.  Specify  one
                        protocol.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "listeners": [
              {
                "portMapping": {
                  "port": integer,
                  "protocol": "http"|"tcp"|"http2"|"grpc"
                }
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --virtual-router-name (string)
          The name of the virtual router to update.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update a virtual router

       The  following  update-virtual-router example uses a JSON input file to
       update a virtual router listener port.

          aws appmesh update-virtual-router \
              --cli-input-json file://update-virtual-router.json

       Contents of update-virtual-router.json:

          {
              "meshName": "app1",
              "spec": {
                  "listeners": [
                      {
                          "portMapping": {
                              "port": 8080,
                              "protocol": "http"
                          }
                      }
                  ]
              },
              "virtualRouterName": "vrServiceB"
          }

       Output:
