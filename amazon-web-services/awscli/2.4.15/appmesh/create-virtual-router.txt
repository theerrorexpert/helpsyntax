CREATE-VIRTUAL-ROUTER()                                CREATE-VIRTUAL-ROUTER()



NAME
       create-virtual-router -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a virtual router within a service mesh.

       Specify  a  listener  for  any inbound traffic that your virtual router
       receives. Create a virtual router for each protocol and port  that  you
       need  to  route. Virtual routers handle traffic for one or more virtual
       services within your mesh. After you create your virtual router, create
       and  associate  routes  for  your  virtual  router that direct incoming
       requests to different virtual nodes.

       For more information about virtual routers, see Virtual routers .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-virtual-router
          [--client-token <value>]
          --mesh-name <value>
          [--mesh-owner <value>]
          --spec <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          --virtual-router-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you  provide  to  ensure  the
          idempotency  of the request. Up to 36 letters, numbers, hyphens, and
          underscores are allowed.

       --mesh-name (string)
          The name of the service mesh to create the virtual router in.

       --mesh-owner (string)
          The AWS IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If the account  ID
          is  not  your  own, then the account that you specify must share the
          mesh with your account before you can create  the  resource  in  the
          service  mesh.  For more information about mesh sharing, see Working
          with shared meshes .

       --spec (structure)
          The virtual router specification to apply.

          listeners -> (list)
              The listeners that the virtual router  is  expected  to  receive
              inbound traffic from. You can specify one listener.

              (structure)
                 An object that represents a virtual router listener.

                 portMapping -> (structure)
                     An object that represents a port mapping.

                     port -> (integer)
                        The port used for the port mapping.

                     protocol -> (string)
                        The  protocol  used  for the port mapping. Specify one
                        protocol.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "listeners": [
              {
                "portMapping": {
                  "port": integer,
                  "protocol": "http"|"tcp"|"http2"|"grpc"
                }
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --tags (list)
          Optional metadata that you can apply to the virtual router to assist
          with categorization and organization. Each tag consists of a key and
          an optional value, both of which you define. Tag  keys  can  have  a
          maximum  character length of 128 characters, and tag values can have
          a maximum length of 256 characters.

          (structure)
              Optional metadata that you apply to a resource  to  assist  with
              categorization  and organization. Each tag consists of a key and
              an optional value, both of which you define. Tag keys can have a
              maximum  character  length of 128 characters, and tag values can
              have a maximum length of 256 characters.

              key -> (string)
                 One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key  is  a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              value -> (string)
                 The optional part of a key-value pair that make up a  tag.  A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --virtual-router-name (string)
          The name to use for the virtual router.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a new virtual router

       The  following  create-virtual-router example uses a JSON input file to
       create a virtual router with a listener for HTTP using port 80.

          aws appmesh create-virtual-router \
              --cli-input-json file://create-virtual-router.json

       Contents of create-virtual-router.json:

          {
              "meshName": "app1",
              "spec": {
                  "listeners": [
                      {
                          "portMapping": {
                              "port": 80,
                              "protocol": "http"
                          }
                      }

              },
              "virtualRouterName": "vrServiceB"
          }
