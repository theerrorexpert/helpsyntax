OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you  provide  to  ensure  the
          idempotency  of the request. Up to 36 letters, numbers, hyphens, and
          underscores are allowed.

       --mesh-name (string)

       --mesh-owner (string)
          The AWS IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If the account  ID
          is  not  your  own,  then it's the ID of the account that shared the
          mesh with your account. For more information about mesh sharing, see
          Working with shared meshes .

                     Mesh  resource  in a conversation. For example, if a vir-
                     tual node backend uses a virtual router provider to route
                     to  another  virtual  node,  then  the  timeout should be

                     default value is 15 seconds. If you set a higher timeout,
                     then  make sure that the higher value is set for each App
                     Mesh resource in a conversation. For example, if  a  vir-
                     tual node backend uses a virtual router provider to route
                     to another virtual  node,  then  the  timeout  should  be
                     greater  than  15  seconds for the source and destination
                     virtual node and the route.

                        target  with  a  relative  weight  of 50 receives five
                        times as much traffic as one with a relative weight of

                     virtual service name is my-service.local and you want the
                     route to match  requests  to  my-service.local/metrics  ,

       --virtual-router-name (string)
          The name of the virtual router that the route is associated with.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                            relative  weight  of  10. The total weight for all
                            targets combined must be less  than  or  equal  to
                            100.

                        Specifies the path to match requests with. This param-
                        eter  must  always  start  with  /  ,  which by itself
                        matches all requests to the virtual service name.  You
                        can also match for path-based routing of requests. For
                        example, if  your  virtual  service  name  is  my-ser-
                        vice.local and you want the route to match requests to
                        my-service.local/metrics , your prefix should be /met-
                        rics .

                        An object that represents a per request  timeout.  The
                        default value is 15 seconds. If you set a higher time-
                        out, then make sure that the higher value is  set  for
                        each App Mesh resource in a conversation. For example,
                        if a  virtual  node  backend  uses  a  virtual  router
                        provider  to  route  to another virtual node, then the
                        timeout should be greater  than  15  seconds  for  the
                        source and destination virtual node and the route.

                        unit -> (string)

                            An  object  that represents a target and its rela-
                            tive weight. Traffic is distributed across targets
                            according to their relative weight. For example, a
                            weighted target  with  a  relative  weight  of  50
                            receives  five times as much traffic as one with a
                            relative weight of 10. The total  weight  for  all
                            targets  combined  must  be  less than or equal to
                            100.

                            virtualNode -> (string)
