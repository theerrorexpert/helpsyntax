                                            as  a partition key. If you speci-
                                            fied a range key,  the  item  uses
                                            the range key as a sort key.

                                          o 'UPDATE' - Update an existing item

                                            must match the specified hash key.
                                            If  you specified a range key, the
                                            range key must  match  the  item's
                                            sort key.

                                          Information  needed to configure the
                                          payload.

                                          By default, AWS IoT Events generates
                                          a  standard  payload in JSON for any
                                          action. This action payload contains
                                          all  attribute-value pairs that have
                                          the information about  the  detector
                                          model  instance  and the event trig-
                                          gered the action. To  configure  the
                                          action payload, you can use content-
                                          Expression .

                                      tains  all  attribute-value  pairs  that
                                      have  the information about the detector
                                      model instance and the event that  trig-
                                      gered  the action. You can customize the
                                      payload  .  A  separate  column  of  the
                                      DynamoDB      table     receives     one
                                      attribute-value pair in the payload that

                                            as  a partition key. If you speci-
                                            fied a range key,  the  item  uses
                                            the range key as a sort key.

                                          o 'UPDATE' - Update an existing item

                                          By default, AWS IoT Events generates
                                          a  standard  payload in JSON for any
                                          action. This action payload contains
                                          all  attribute-value pairs that have
                                          the information about  the  detector
                                          model  instance  and the event trig-
                                          gered the action. To  configure  the
                                          action payload, you can use content-
                                          Expression .

                                      tains  all  attribute-value  pairs  that
                                      have  the information about the detector
                                      model instance and the event that  trig-
                                      gered  the action. You can customize the
                                      payload  .  A  separate  column  of  the
                                      DynamoDB      table     receives     one
                                      attribute-value pair in the payload that
                                      you  specify.  For more information, see

                                          By default, AWS IoT Events generates
                                          a  standard  payload in JSON for any
                                          action. This action payload contains
                                          all  attribute-value pairs that have
                                          the information about  the  detector
                                          model  instance  and the event trig-
                                          gered the action. To  configure  the
                                          action payload, you can use content-
                                          Expression .

                                            as  a partition key. If you speci-
                                            fied a range key,  the  item  uses
                                            the range key as a sort key.

                                          o 'UPDATE' - Update an existing item

                                          If you don't specify this parameter,
                                          the name of the DynamoDB  column  is
                                          payload .

                                      tableName -> (string)
                                          The  name of the DynamoDB table. The
                                          tableName value must match the table
                                          name of the target DynamoDB table.

                                      payload -> (structure)
                                          Information  needed to configure the
                                          payload.

                                          By default, AWS IoT Events generates
                                          a  standard  payload in JSON for any
                                          action. This action payload contains
                                          all  attribute-value pairs that have
                                          the information about  the  detector
                                          model  instance  and the event trig-
                                          gered the action. To  configure  the
                                          action payload, you can use content-
                                          Expression .

                                             The content of the  payload.  You
                                             can  use a string expression that
                                             includes      quoted      strings
                                             ('<string>'  ), variables ($vari-

                                             ),   string  concatenations,  and
                                             quoted strings that  contain  ${}

                                      created. The default action payload con-
                                      tains  all  attribute-value  pairs  that
                                      have  the information about the detector
                                      model instance and the event that  trig-
                                      gered  the action. You can customize the
                                      payload  .  A  separate  column  of  the
                                      DynamoDB      table     receives     one
                                      attribute-value pair in the payload that
                                      you  specify.  For more information, see

                                          Information  needed to configure the
                                          payload.

                                          By default, AWS IoT Events generates
                                          a  standard  payload in JSON for any
                                          action. This action payload contains
                                          all  attribute-value pairs that have
                                          the information about  the  detector
                                          model  instance  and the event trig-
                                          gered the action. To  configure  the
                                          action payload, you can use content-
                                          Expression .

                                             The value of the payload type can
                                             be either STRING or JSON .

                                   dynamoDB -> (structure)
                                      Writes  to  the  DynamoDB table that you
                                      created. The default action payload con-
                                      tains  all  attribute-value  pairs  that
                                      have the information about the  detector
                                      model  instance and the event that trig-
                                      gered the action. You can customize  the
                                      payload . One column of the DynamoDB ta-
                                      ble receives all  attribute-value  pairs
                                      in  the  payload  that  you specify. For

                                          The  data  type  for  the  range key
                                          (also called the sort key), You  can
                                          specify the following values:

                                          o 'STRING'  -  The  range  key  is a
                                            string.

                                          o 'NUMBER' - The range key  is  num-
                                            ber.

                                          If you don't specify rangeKeyField ,
                                          the default value is 'STRING' .

                                          ues:

                                          o 'INSERT' - Insert data  as  a  new
                                            item into the DynamoDB table. This
                                            item uses the specified  hash  key
                                            as  a partition key. If you speci-
                                            fied a range key,  the  item  uses
                                            the range key as a sort key.

                                          o 'UPDATE' - Update an existing item

                                            data.  This  item's  partition key
                                            must match the specified hash key.
                                            If  you specified a range key, the
                                            range key must  match  the  item's
                                            sort key.

                                            of the DynamoDB table. This item's
                                            partition key must match the spec-
                                            ified hash key. If you specified a
                                            range  key,  the  range  key  must
                                            match the item's sort key.

                                          If you don't specify this parameter,
                                          AWS IoT Events triggers the 'INSERT'
                                          operation.

                                          If you don't specify this parameter,
                                          the name of the DynamoDB  column  is
                                          payload .

                                      tableName -> (string)
                                          The  name of the DynamoDB table. The
                                          tableName value must match the table
                                          name of the target DynamoDB table.

                                      payload -> (structure)
                                          Information  needed to configure the
                                          payload.

                                          By default, AWS IoT Events generates
                                          a  standard  payload in JSON for any
                                          action. This action payload contains
                                          all  attribute-value pairs that have
                                          the information about  the  detector
                                          model  instance  and the event trig-
                                          gered the action. To  configure  the
                                          action payload, you can use content-
                                          Expression .

                                             ),   string  concatenations,  and
                                             quoted strings that  contain  ${}
                                             as  the  content. The recommended

       --detector-model-description (string)
          A brief description of the detector model.

       --key (string)
          The input attribute key used to identify a device or system to  cre-
          ate a detector (an instance of the detector model) and then to route
          each input received to the  appropriate  detector  (instance).  This
          parameter uses a JSON-path expression in the message payload of each
          input to specify the attribute-value pair that is used  to  identify
          the device associated with the input.

       --role-arn (string)
          The ARN of the role that grants permission to AWS IoT Events to per-
          form its operations.

       --tags (list)
          Metadata that can be used to manage the detector model.

          (structure)
              Metadata that can be used to manage the resource.

              key -> (string)
                 The tag's key.

              value -> (string)
                 The tag's value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --evaluation-method (string)
          Information about the order in which events are  evaluated  and  how
          actions are executed.

          Possible values:

          o BATCH

          o SERIAL

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

OUTPUT
       detectorModelConfiguration -> (structure)
          Information about how the detector model is configured.

          detectorModelName -> (string)
              The name of the detector model.

          detectorModelVersion -> (string)
              The version of the detector model.

          detectorModelDescription -> (string)
              A brief description of the detector model.

          detectorModelArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the detector model.

          roleArn -> (string)
              The  ARN of the role that grants permission to AWS IoT Events to
              perform its operations.

          creationTime -> (timestamp)
              The time the detector model was created.

          lastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
              The time the detector model was last updated.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the detector model.

          key -> (string)
              The value used to identify a detector instance. When a device or
              system  sends  input,  a new detector instance with a unique key
              value is created. AWS IoT Events can continue to route input  to
              its  corresponding  detector  instance based on this identifying
              information.

              This  parameter  uses  a  JSON-path  expression  to  select  the
              attribute-value  pair  in  the  message payload that is used for
              identification. To route the message  to  the  correct  detector
              instance,  the  device must send a message payload that contains
              the same attribute-value.

          evaluationMethod -> (string)
              Information about the order in which events  are  evaluated  and
              how actions are executed.
