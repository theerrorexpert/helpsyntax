NAME
       get-detector-model-analysis-results -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves one or more analysis results of the detector model.

       NOTE:
          After  AWS IoT Events starts analyzing your detector model, you have
          up to 24 hours to retrieve the analysis results.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-detector-model-analysis-results
          --analysis-id <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --analysis-id (string)
          The ID of the analysis result that you want to retrieve.

       --next-token (string)
          The token that you can use to return the next set of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to be returned per request.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       analysisResults -> (list)
          Contains information about one or more analysis results.

          (structure)
              Contains the result of the analysis.

              type -> (string)
                 The type of the analysis result. Analyses fall into the  fol-
                 lowing  types  based  on  the validators used to generate the
                 analysis result:

                 o supported-actions - You must specify AWS  IoT  Events  sup-
                   ported  actions that work with other AWS services in a sup-
                   ported AWS Region.

                 o service-limits - Resources or API operations  can't  exceed
                   service quotas (also known as limits). Update your detector
                   model or request a quota increase.

                 o structure - The detector model must follow a structure that
                   AWS IoT Events supports.

                 o expression-syntax   -   Your  expression  must  follow  the
                   required syntax.

                 o data-type - Data types referenced  in  the  detector  model
                   must be compatible.

                 o referenced-data  -  You  must define the data referenced in
                   your detector model before you can use the data.

                 o referenced-resource - Resources  that  the  detector  model
                   uses must be available.

                 For  more information, see Running detector model analyses in
                 the AWS IoT Events Developer Guide .

              level -> (string)
                 The severity level of  the  analysis  result.  Based  on  the
                 severity level, analysis results fall into three general cat-
                 egories:

                 o INFO - An information result tells you about a  significant
                   field  in  your detector model. This type of result usually
                   doesn't require immediate action.

                 o WARNING - A  warning  result  draws  special  attention  to
                   fields  that might cause issues for your detector model. We
                   recommend that  you  review  warnings  and  take  necessary
                   actions  before  you  use your detector model in production
                   environments. Otherwise, the detector model might not  work
                   as expected.

                 o ERROR  - An error result notifies you about a problem found
                   in your detector model. You must fix all errors before  you
                   can publish your detector model.

              message -> (string)
                 Contains additional information about the analysis result.

              locations -> (list)
                 Contains one or more locations that you can use to locate the
                 fields in your detector model that the analysis result refer-
                 ences.

                 (structure)
                     Contains information that you can use to locate the field
                     in your detector model that the  analysis  result  refer-
                     ences.

                     path -> (string)
                        A  JsonPath expression that identifies the error field
                        in your detector model.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token that you can use to return the next  set  of  results,  or
          null if there are no more results.
