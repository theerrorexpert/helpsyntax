UPLOAD-ARCHIVE()                                              UPLOAD-ARCHIVE()



NAME
       upload-archive -

DESCRIPTION
       This operation adds an archive to a vault. This is a synchronous opera-
       tion, and for a successful upload, your data is durably persisted. Ama-
       zon S3 Glacier returns the archive ID in the x-amz-archive-id header of
       the response.

       You must use the archive ID to access your data in Amazon  S3  Glacier.
       After you upload an archive, you should save the archive ID returned so
       that you can retrieve or delete the archive later. Besides  saving  the
       archive  ID, you can also index it and give it a friendly name to allow
       for better searching. You can also use the optional archive description
       field to specify how the archive is referred to in an external index of
       archives, such as you might create in Amazon DynamoDB. You can also get
       the  vault  inventory  to  obtain a list of archive IDs in a vault. For
       more information, see  InitiateJob .

       You must provide a SHA256 tree hash of the data you are uploading.  For
       information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see Computing Checksums
       .

       You can optionally specify an archive description of up to 1,024 print-
       able  ASCII  characters.  You  can get the archive description when you
       either retrieve the archive or get the vault inventory. For more infor-
       mation,  see   InitiateJob  .  Amazon  Glacier  does  not interpret the
       description in any way. An archive description  does  not  need  to  be
       unique.  You cannot use the description to retrieve or sort the archive
       list.

       Archives are immutable. After you upload an archive,  you  cannot  edit
       the archive or its description.

       An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).
       However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have  any
       permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to per-
       form specific actions. For more information, see Access  Control  Using
       AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) .

       For  conceptual  information  and underlying REST API, see Uploading an
       Archive in Amazon Glacier and Upload  Archive  in  the  Amazon  Glacier
       Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            upload-archive
          --vault-name <value>
          --account-id <value>
          [--archive-description <value>]
          [--checksum <value>]
          [--body <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --vault-name (string)
          The name of the vault.

       --account-id (string)
          The  AccountId  value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns
          the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally  a
          single  '-  ' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS
          account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request.
          If  you  use  an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the
          ID.

       --archive-description (string)
          The optional description of the archive you are uploading.

       --checksum (string)
          The SHA256 tree hash of the data being uploaded.

       --body (blob)
          The data to upload.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command uploads an archive in the  current  folder  named
       archive.zip to a vault named my-vault:

          aws glacier upload-archive --account-id - --vault-name my-vault --body archive.zip

       Output:

          {
              "archiveId": "kKB7ymWJVpPSwhGP6ycSOAekp9ZYe_--zM_mw6k76ZFGEIWQX-ybtRDvc2VkPSDtfKmQrj0IRQLSGsNuDp-AJVlu2ccmDSyDUmZwKbwbpAdGATGDiB3hHO0bjbGehXTcApVud_wyDw",
              "checksum": "969fb39823836d81f0cc028195fcdbcbbe76cdde932d4646fa7de5f21e18aa67",
              "location": "/0123456789012/vaults/my-vault/archives/kKB7ymWJVpPSwhGP6ycSOAekp9ZYe_--zM_mw6k76ZFGEIWQX-ybtRDvc2VkPSDtfKmQrj0IRQLSGsNuDp-AJVlu2ccmDSyDUmZwKbwbpAdGATGDiB3hHO0bjbGehXTcApVud_wyDw"
          }

       Amazon  Glacier  requires an account ID argument when performing opera-
       tions, but you can use a hyphen to specify the in-use account.

       To retrieve an uploaded archive, initiate a retrieval job with the  aws
       glacier initiate-job command.

OUTPUT
       location -> (string)
          The relative URI path of the newly added archive resource.

       checksum -> (string)
          The checksum of the archive computed by Amazon S3 Glacier.

       archiveId -> (string)
          The  ID  of  the archive. This value is also included as part of the
          location.
