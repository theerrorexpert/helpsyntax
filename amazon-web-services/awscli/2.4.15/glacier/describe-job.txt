DESCRIBE-JOB()                                                  DESCRIBE-JOB()



NAME
       describe-job -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  returns  information about a job you previously initi-
       ated, including the job initiation date, the  user  who  initiated  the
       job,  the  job  status  code/message and the Amazon SNS topic to notify
       after Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) completes the job. For more  informa-
       tion about initiating a job, see  InitiateJob .

       NOTE:
          This operation enables you to check the status of your job. However,
          it is strongly recommended that you set up an Amazon SNS  topic  and
          specify  it  in your initiate job request so that Glacier can notify
          the topic after it completes the job.

       A job ID will not expire for at least 24 hours after Glacier  completes
       the job.

       An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).
       However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have  any
       permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to per-
       form specific actions. For more information, see Access  Control  Using
       AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) .

       For  more information about using this operation, see the documentation
       for the underlying REST API Describe Job in the Amazon  Glacier  Devel-
       oper Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-job
          --account-id <value>
          --vault-name <value>
          --job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The  AccountId  value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns
          the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally  a
          single  '-  ' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS
          account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request.
          If  you  use  an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the
          ID.

       --vault-name (string)
          The name of the vault.

       --job-id (string)
          The ID of the job to describe.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  command  retrieves  information  about   an   inventory
       retrieval job on a vault named my-vault:

          aws glacier describe-job --account-id - --vault-name my-vault --job-id zbxcm3Z_3z5UkoroF7SuZKrxgGoDc3RloGduS7Eg-RO47Yc6FxsdGBgf_Q2DK5Ejh18CnTS5XW4_XqlNHS61dsO4CnMW

       Output:

          {
              "InventoryRetrievalParameters": {
                  "Format": "JSON"
              },
              "VaultARN": "arn:aws:glacier:us-west-2:0123456789012:vaults/my-vault",
              "Completed": false,
              "JobId": "zbxcm3Z_3z5UkoroF7SuZKrxgGoDc3RloGduS7Eg-RO47Yc6FxsdGBgf_Q2DK5Ejh18CnTS5XW4_XqlNHS61dsO4CnMW",
              "Action": "InventoryRetrieval",
              "CreationDate": "2015-07-17T20:23:41.616Z",
              "StatusCode": "InProgress"
          }

       The  job  ID can be found in the output of aws glacier initiate-job and
       aws glacier list-jobs.  Amazon Glacier requires an account ID  argument
       when  performing  operations,  but  you can use a hyphen to specify the
       in-use account.

OUTPUT
       JobId -> (string)
          An opaque string that identifies an Amazon S3 Glacier job.

       JobDescription -> (string)
          The job description provided when initiating the job.

       Action -> (string)
          The job type. This value is either ArchiveRetrieval  ,  InventoryRe-
          trieval , or Select .

       ArchiveId -> (string)
          The archive ID requested for a select job or archive retrieval. Oth-
          erwise, this field is null.

       VaultARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the vault from  which  an  archive
          retrieval was requested.

       CreationDate -> (string)
          The UTC date when the job was created. This value is a string repre-
          sentation    of    ISO    8601    date    format,    for     example
          "2012-03-20T17:03:43.221Z" .

       Completed -> (boolean)
          The  job  status.  When a job is completed, you get the job's output
          using Get Job Output (GET output).

       StatusCode -> (string)
          The status code can be InProgress , Succeeded  ,  or  Failed  ,  and
          indicates the status of the job.

       StatusMessage -> (string)
          A friendly message that describes the job status.

       ArchiveSizeInBytes -> (long)
          For an archive retrieval job, this value is the size in bytes of the
          archive being requested for download. For an inventory retrieval  or
          select job, this value is null.

       InventorySizeInBytes -> (long)
          For  an  inventory retrieval job, this value is the size in bytes of
          the inventory requested for download. For an  archive  retrieval  or
          select job, this value is null.

       SNSTopic -> (string)
          An Amazon SNS topic that receives notification.

       CompletionDate -> (string)
          The  UTC  time  that  the job request completed. While the job is in
          progress, the value is null.

       SHA256TreeHash -> (string)
          For an archive retrieval job, this value is the checksum of the  ar-
          chive. Otherwise, this value is null.

          The SHA256 tree hash value for the requested range of an archive. If
          the InitiateJob request for an archive specified a tree-hash aligned
          range, then this field returns a value.

          If  the  whole  archive  is retrieved, this value is the same as the
          ArchiveSHA256TreeHash value.

          This field is null for the following:

          o Archive retrieval jobs that specify a range that is not  tree-hash
            aligned

          o Archival  jobs that specify a range that is equal to the whole ar-
            chive, when the job status is InProgress

          o Inventory jobs

          o Select jobs

       ArchiveSHA256TreeHash -> (string)
          The SHA256 tree hash of the entire archive for an archive retrieval.
          For inventory retrieval or select jobs, this field is null.

       RetrievalByteRange -> (string)
          The  retrieved  byte  range  for  archive retrieval jobs in the form
          StartByteValue -EndByteValue . If no range was specified in the  ar-
          chive  retrieval, then the whole archive is retrieved. In this case,
          StartByteValue equals 0 and EndByteValue equals the size of the  ar-
          chive minus 1. For inventory retrieval or select jobs, this field is
          null.

       Tier -> (string)
          The tier to use for a select or an archive retrieval.  Valid  values
          are Expedited , Standard , or Bulk . Standard is the default.

          EndDate -> (string)
              The end of the date range in UTC for vault  inventory  retrieval
              that  includes  archives  created  before  this date. This value
              should be a string in the ISO  8601  date  format,  for  example
              2013-03-20T17:03:43Z .

          Limit -> (string)
              The  maximum number of inventory items returned per vault inven-
              tory retrieval request. This limit is set  when  initiating  the

          Marker -> (string)
              An opaque string that represents where to continue pagination of
              the vault inventory retrieval results. You use the marker  in  a
              new InitiateJob request to obtain additional inventory items. If
