SET-VAULT-NOTIFICATIONS()                            SET-VAULT-NOTIFICATIONS()



NAME
       set-vault-notifications -

DESCRIPTION
       This operation configures notifications that will be sent when specific
       events happen to a vault. By default, you don't get any  notifications.

       To  configure  vault notifications, send a PUT request to the notifica-
       tion-configuration subresource of the vault. The request should include
       a  JSON  document that provides an Amazon SNS topic and specific events
       for which you want Amazon S3  Glacier  to  send  notifications  to  the
       topic.

       Amazon  SNS  topics must grant permission to the vault to be allowed to
       publish notifications to the topic. You can configure a vault  to  pub-
       lish a notification for the following vault events:

       o ArchiveRetrievalCompleted  This event occurs when a job that was ini-
         tiated for an archive retrieval is completed  (  InitiateJob  ).  The
         status of the completed job can be "Succeeded" or "Failed". The noti-
         fication sent to the SNS topic is the same output  as  returned  from
         DescribeJob .

       o InventoryRetrievalCompleted  This  event  occurs  when a job that was
         initiated for an inventory retrieval is completed  (  InitiateJob  ).
         The  status  of the completed job can be "Succeeded" or "Failed". The
         notification sent to the SNS topic is the  same  output  as  returned
         from  DescribeJob .

       An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).
       However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have  any
       permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to per-
       form specific actions. For more information, see Access  Control  Using
       AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) .

       For  conceptual  information  and  underlying REST API, see Configuring
       Vault Notifications in Amazon S3 Glacier  and  Set  Vault  Notification
       Configuration in the Amazon Glacier Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            set-vault-notifications
          --account-id <value>
          --vault-name <value>
          [--vault-notification-config <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The  AccountId  value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns
          the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally  a
          single  '-  ' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS
          account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request.
          If  you  use  an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the
          ID.

       --vault-name (string)
          The name of the vault.

       --vault-notification-config (structure)
          Provides options for specifying notification configuration.

          SNSTopic -> (string)
              The Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic Amazon
              Resource Name (ARN).

          Events -> (list)
              A  list  of  one or more events for which Amazon S3 Glacier will
              send a notification to the specified Amazon SNS topic.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SNSTopic=string,Events=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SNSTopic": "string",
            "Events": ["string", ...]
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command configures SNS notifications for  a  vault  named
       my-vault:

          aws glacier set-vault-notifications --account-id - --vault-name my-vault --vault-notification-config file://notificationconfig.json

       notificationconfig.json is a JSON file in the current folder that spec-
       ifies an SNS topic and the events to publish:

          {
            "SNSTopic": "arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:0123456789012:my-vault",
            "Events": ["ArchiveRetrievalCompleted", "InventoryRetrievalCompleted"]
          }

       Amazon Glacier requires an account ID argument when  performing  opera-
       tions, but you can use a hyphen to specify the in-use account.

OUTPUT
       None
