ABORT-VAULT-LOCK()                                          ABORT-VAULT-LOCK()



NAME
       abort-vault-lock -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  aborts  the vault locking process if the vault lock is
       not in the Locked state. If the vault lock is in the Locked state  when
       this  operation  is requested, the operation returns an AccessDeniedEx-
       ception error. Aborting the vault locking  process  removes  the  vault
       lock policy from the specified vault.

       A  vault  lock  is  put into the InProgress state by calling  Initiate-
       VaultLock . A vault lock is put into the Locked state by calling   Com-
       pleteVaultLock . You can get the state of a vault lock by calling  Get-
       VaultLock . For more information about the vault locking  process,  see
       Amazon Glacier Vault Lock . For more information about vault lock poli-
       cies, see Amazon Glacier Access Control with Vault Lock Policies .

       This operation is idempotent. You can successfully invoke  this  opera-
       tion multiple times, if the vault lock is in the InProgress state or if
       there is no policy associated with the vault.

SYNOPSIS
            abort-vault-lock
          --account-id <value>
          --vault-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The AccountId value is the AWS account ID. This value must match the
          AWS  account  ID  associated  with  the credentials used to sign the
          request. You can either specify an AWS account ID  or  optionally  a
          single  '-  '  (hyphen),  in  which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS
          account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request.
          If  you specify your account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in
          the ID.

       --vault-name (string)
          The name of the vault.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To abort an in-progress vault lock process

       The following abort-vault-lock example deletes a vault lock policy from
       the  specified  vault  and  resets  the lock state of the vault lock to
       unlocked.

          aws glacier abort-vault-lock \
              --account-id - \
              --vault-name MyVaultName

       This command produces no output.

       For more information, see Abort Vault Lock (DELETE lock-policy) in  the
       Amazon Glacier API Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
