SET-DATA-RETRIEVAL-POLICY()                        SET-DATA-RETRIEVAL-POLICY()



NAME
       set-data-retrieval-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  sets  and  then  enacts a data retrieval policy in the
       region specified in the PUT request. You can set one policy per  region
       for  an  AWS  account.  The policy is enacted within a few minutes of a
       successful PUT operation.

       The set policy operation does not affect retrieval jobs  that  were  in
       progress before the policy was enacted. For more information about data
       retrieval policies, see Amazon Glacier Data Retrieval Policies .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            set-data-retrieval-policy
          --account-id <value>
          [--policy <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The AccountId value is the AWS account ID. This value must match the
          AWS  account  ID  associated  with  the credentials used to sign the
          request. You can either specify an AWS account ID  or  optionally  a
          single  '-  '  (hyphen),  in  which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS
          account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request.
          If  you specify your account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in
          the ID.

       --policy (structure)
          The data retrieval policy in JSON format.

          Rules -> (list)
              The policy rule. Although this is a list type,  currently  there
              must  be  only  one  rule,  which  contains a Strategy field and
              optionally a BytesPerHour field.

              (structure)
                 Data retrieval policy rule.

                 Strategy -> (string)
                     The type of data retrieval policy to set.

                     Valid values: BytesPerHour|FreeTier|None

                 BytesPerHour -> (long)
                     The maximum number of bytes that can be retrieved  in  an
                     hour.

                     This  field is required only if the value of the Strategy
                     field is  BytesPerHour  .  Your  PUT  operation  will  be
                     rejected if the Strategy field is not set to BytesPerHour
                     and you set this field.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Rules=[{Strategy=string,BytesPerHour=long},{Strategy=string,BytesPerHour=long}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Rules": [
              {
                "Strategy": "string",
                "BytesPerHour": long
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command configures a data retrieval policy for the in-use
       account:

          aws glacier set-data-retrieval-policy --account-id - --policy file://data-retrieval-policy.json

       data-retrieval-policy.json  is  a  JSON file in the current folder that
       specifies a data retrieval policy:

          {
            "Rules":[
               {
                   "Strategy":"BytesPerHour",
                   "BytesPerHour":10737418240
                }
             ]
          }

       Amazon Glacier requires an account ID argument when  performing  opera-
       tions, but you can use a hyphen to specify the in-use account.

       The  following command sets the data retrieval policy to FreeTier using
       inline JSON:

          aws glacier set-data-retrieval-policy --account-id - --policy '{"Rules":[{"Strategy":"FreeTier"}]}'

       See Set Data Retrieval Policy in the Amazon Glacier API  Reference  for
       details on the policy format.

OUTPUT
       None
