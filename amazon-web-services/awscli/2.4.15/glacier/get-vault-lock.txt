GET-VAULT-LOCK()                                              GET-VAULT-LOCK()



NAME
       get-vault-lock -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation retrieves the following attributes from the lock-policy
       subresource set on the specified vault:

       o The vault lock policy set on the vault.

       o The state of the vault lock, which is either InProgess or Locked .

       o When the lock ID expires. The lock ID is used to complete  the  vault
         locking process.

       o When  the vault lock was initiated and put into the InProgress state.

       A vault lock is put into the InProgress  state  by  calling   Initiate-
       VaultLock  . A vault lock is put into the Locked state by calling  Com-
       pleteVaultLock . You can abort the vault  locking  process  by  calling
       AbortVaultLock  . For more information about the vault locking process,
       Amazon Glacier Vault Lock .

       If there is no vault lock  policy  set  on  the  vault,  the  operation
       returns  a  404  Not found error. For more information about vault lock
       policies, Amazon Glacier Access Control with Vault Lock Policies .

SYNOPSIS
            get-vault-lock
          --account-id <value>
          --vault-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The AccountId value is the AWS account ID of the account  that  owns
          the  vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a
          single '- ' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses  the  AWS
          account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request.
          If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens  ('-')  in  the
          ID.

       --vault-name (string)
          The name of the vault.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the details of a vault lock

       The  following  get-vault-lock  example retrieved the details about the
       lock for the specified vault.

          aws glacier get-vault-lock \
              --account-id - \
              --vault-name MyVaultName

       Output:

          {
              "Policy": "{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Sid\":\"Define-vault-lock\",\"Effect\":\"Deny\",\"Principal\":{\"AWS\":\"arn:aws:iam::999999999999:root\"},\"Action\":\"glacier:DeleteArchive\",\"Resource\":\"arn:aws:glacier:us-west-2:99999999999:vaults/MyVaultName\",\"Condition\":{\"NumericLessThanEquals\":{\"glacier:ArchiveAgeinDays\":\"365\"}}}]}",
              "State": "Locked",
              "CreationDate": "2019-07-29T22:25:28.640Z"
          }

OUTPUT
       Policy -> (string)
          The  vault  lock policy as a JSON string, which uses "" as an escape
          character.

       State -> (string)
          The state of the vault lock. InProgress or Locked .

       ExpirationDate -> (string)
          The UTC date and time at which the lock ID expires. This  value  can
          be null if the vault lock is in a Locked state.

       CreationDate -> (string)
          The  UTC  date  and  time  at  which the vault lock was put into the
          InProgress state.
