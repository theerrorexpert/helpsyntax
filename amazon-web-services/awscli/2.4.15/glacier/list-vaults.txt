LIST-VAULTS()                                                    LIST-VAULTS()



NAME
       list-vaults -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  lists  all vaults owned by the calling user's account.
       The list returned in the response is ASCII-sorted by vault name.

       By default, this operation returns up to 10 items. If  there  are  more
       vaults  to  list,  the  response marker field contains the vault Amazon
       Resource Name (ARN) at which to continue  the  list  with  a  new  List
       Vaults  request; otherwise, the marker field is null . To return a list
       of vaults that begins at a  specific  vault,  set  the  marker  request
       parameter  to  the  vault  ARN you obtained from a previous List Vaults
       request. You can also limit  the  number  of  vaults  returned  in  the
       response by specifying the limit parameter in the request.

       An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).
       However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have  any
       permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to per-
       form specific actions. For more information, see Access  Control  Using
       AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) .

       For  conceptual  information  and  underlying  REST API, see Retrieving
       Vault Metadata in Amazon S3 Glacier  and  List  Vaults  in  the  Amazon
       Glacier Developer Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-vaults  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: VaultList

SYNOPSIS
            list-vaults
          --account-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The AccountId value is the AWS account ID. This value must match the
          AWS  account  ID  associated  with  the credentials used to sign the
          request. You can either specify an AWS account ID  or  optionally  a
          single  '-  '  (hyphen),  in  which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS
          account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request.
          If  you specify your account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in
          the ID.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (string)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (string)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  command  lists  the  vaults  in the default account and
       region:

          aws glacier list-vaults --account-id -

       Output:

          {
              "VaultList": [
                  {
                      "SizeInBytes": 3178496,
                      "VaultARN": "arn:aws:glacier:us-west-2:0123456789012:vaults/my-vault",
                      "LastInventoryDate": "2015-04-07T00:26:19.028Z",
                      "VaultName": "my-vault",
                      "NumberOfArchives": 1,
                      "CreationDate": "2015-04-06T21:23:45.708Z"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Amazon Glacier requires an account ID argument when  performing  opera-
       tions, but you can use a hyphen to specify the in-use account.

OUTPUT
       VaultList -> (list)
          List of vaults.

          (structure)
              Contains the Amazon S3 Glacier response to your request.

              VaultARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the vault.

              VaultName -> (string)
                 The name of the vault.

              CreationDate -> (string)
                 The  Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) date when the vault was
                 created. This value should be a string in the ISO  8601  date
                 format, for example 2012-03-20T17:03:43.221Z .

              LastInventoryDate -> (string)
                 The  Universal  Coordinated  Time  (UTC)  date when Amazon S3
                 Glacier completed the last vault inventory. This value should
                 be  a  string  in  the  ISO  8601  date  format,  for example
                 2012-03-20T17:03:43.221Z .

              NumberOfArchives -> (long)
                 The number of archives in the vault as of the last  inventory
                 date. This field will return null if an inventory has not yet
                 run on the vault, for example if you just created the  vault.

              SizeInBytes -> (long)
                 Total  size, in bytes, of the archives in the vault as of the
                 last inventory date. This field will return null if an inven-
                 tory  has  not  yet run on the vault, for example if you just
                 created the vault.

       Marker -> (string)
          The vault ARN at which to continue pagination of  the  results.  You
          use  the marker in another List Vaults request to obtain more vaults
          in the list.
