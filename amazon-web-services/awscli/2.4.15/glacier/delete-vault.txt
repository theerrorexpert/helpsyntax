DELETE-VAULT()                                                  DELETE-VAULT()



NAME
       delete-vault -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  deletes a vault. Amazon S3 Glacier will delete a vault
       only if there are no archives in the vault as of the last inventory and
       there  have  been  no  writes to the vault since the last inventory. If
       either of these conditions is not satisfied, the vault  deletion  fails
       (that  is,  the  vault is not removed) and Amazon S3 Glacier returns an
       error. You can use  DescribeVault to return the number of archives in a
       vault,  and  you  can  use Initiate a Job (POST jobs) to initiate a new
       inventory retrieval for a vault. The inventory contains the archive IDs
       you use to delete archives using Delete Archive (DELETE archive) .

       This operation is idempotent.

       An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).
       However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have  any
       permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to per-
       form specific actions. For more information, see Access  Control  Using
       AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) .

       For  conceptual  information  and  underlying  REST API, see Deleting a
       Vault in Amazon Glacier and Delete  Vault  in  the  Amazon  S3  Glacier
       Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            delete-vault
          --account-id <value>
          --vault-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The  AccountId  value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns
          the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally  a
          single  '-  ' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS
          account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request.
          If  you  use  an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the
          ID.

       --vault-name (string)
          The name of the vault.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command deletes a vault named my-vault:

          aws glacier delete-vault --vault-name my-vault --account-id -

       This command does not produce any output. Amazon  Glacier  requires  an
       account  ID  argument  when  performing  operations,  but you can use a
       hyphen to specify the in-use account.

OUTPUT
       None
