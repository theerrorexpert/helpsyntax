CREATE-VAULT()                                                  CREATE-VAULT()



NAME
       create-vault -

DESCRIPTION
       This operation creates a new vault with the specified name. The name of
       the vault must be unique within a region for an AWS  account.  You  can
       create  up  to  1,000  vaults  per  account. If you need to create more
       vaults, contact Amazon S3 Glacier.

       You must use the following guidelines when naming a vault.

       o Names can be between 1 and 255 characters long.

       o Allowed characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, '_' (underscore), '-' (hyphen),
         and '.' (period).

       This operation is idempotent.

       An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).
       However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have  any
       permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to per-
       form specific actions. For more information, see Access  Control  Using
       AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) .

       For  conceptual  information  and  underlying  REST API, see Creating a
       Vault in Amazon Glacier and Create Vault in the Amazon  Glacier  Devel-
       oper Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-vault
          --account-id <value>
          --vault-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The AccountId value is the AWS account ID. This value must match the
          AWS account ID associated with the  credentials  used  to  sign  the
          request.  You  can  either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a
          single '- ' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses  the  AWS
          account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request.
          If you specify your account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-')  in
          the ID.

       --vault-name (string)
          The name of the vault.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command creates a new vault named my-vault:

          aws glacier create-vault --vault-name my-vault --account-id -

       Amazon  Glacier  requires an account ID argument when performing opera-
       tions, but you can use a hyphen to specify the in-use account.

OUTPUT
       location -> (string)
          The URI of the vault that was created.
