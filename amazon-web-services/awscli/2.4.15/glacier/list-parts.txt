LIST-PARTS()                                                      LIST-PARTS()



NAME
       list-parts -

DESCRIPTION
       This operation lists the parts of an archive that have been uploaded in
       a specific multipart upload. You can make this request at any time dur-
       ing an in-progress multipart upload before you complete the upload (see
       CompleteMultipartUpload . List Parts returns  an  error  for  completed
       uploads. The list returned in the List Parts response is sorted by part
       range.

       The List Parts operation supports pagination. By default,  this  opera-
       tion returns up to 50 uploaded parts in the response. You should always
       check the response for a marker at which to continue the list; if there
       are  no  more items the marker is null . To return a list of parts that
       begins at a specific part, set the  marker  request  parameter  to  the
       value  you  obtained  from  a previous List Parts request. You can also
       limit the number of parts returned in the response  by  specifying  the
       limit parameter in the request.

       An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).
       However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have  any
       permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to per-
       form specific actions. For more information, see Access  Control  Using
       AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) .

       For  conceptual  information  and  the underlying REST API, see Working
       with Archives in Amazon S3 Glacier and List Parts in the Amazon Glacier
       Developer Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-parts  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: Parts

SYNOPSIS
            list-parts
          --account-id <value>
          --vault-name <value>
          --upload-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The AccountId value is the AWS account ID of the account  that  owns
          the  vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a
          single '- ' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses  the  AWS
          account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request.
          If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens  ('-')  in  the
          ID.

       --vault-name (string)
          The name of the vault.

       --upload-id (string)
          The upload ID of the multipart upload.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (string)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (string)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command lists the uploaded parts for a  multipart  upload
       to a vault named my-vault:

          aws glacier list-parts --account-id - --vault-name my-vault --upload-id "SYZi7qnL-YGqGwAm8Kn3BLP2ElNCvnB-5961R09CSaPmPwkYGHOqeN_nX3-Vhnd2yF0KfB5FkmbnBU9GubbdrCs8ut-D"

       Output:

          {
              "MultipartUploadId": "SYZi7qnL-YGqGwAm8Kn3BLP2ElNCvnB-5961R09CSaPmPwkYGHOqeN_nX3-Vhnd2yF0KfB5FkmbnBU9GubbdrCs8ut-D",
              "Parts": [
                  {
                      "RangeInBytes": "0-1048575",
                      "SHA256TreeHash": "e1f2a7cd6e047350f69b9f8cfa60fa606fe2f02802097a9a026360a7edc1f553"
                  },
                  {
                      "RangeInBytes": "1048576-2097151",
                      "SHA256TreeHash": "43cf3061fb95796aed99a11a6aa3cd8f839eed15e655ab0a597126210636aee6"
                  }
              ],
              "VaultARN": "arn:aws:glacier:us-west-2:0123456789012:vaults/my-vault",
              "CreationDate": "2015-07-18T00:05:23.830Z",
              "PartSizeInBytes": 1048576
          }

       Amazon  Glacier  requires an account ID argument when performing opera-
       tions, but you can use a hyphen to specify the in-use account.

       AWS CLI, see Using Amazon Glacier in the AWS CLI User Guide.

OUTPUT

          The ID of the upload to which the parts are associated.

       VaultARN -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the vault to which the multipart
          upload was initiated.

       ArchiveDescription -> (string)
          The description of the archive that was specified  in  the  Initiate
          Multipart Upload request.

       PartSizeInBytes -> (long)
          The part size in bytes. This is the same value that you specified in
          the Initiate Multipart Upload request.

       CreationDate -> (string)
          The UTC time at which the multipart upload was initiated.

       Parts -> (list)
          A list of the part sizes of the multipart upload. Each object in the
          array contains a RangeBytes and sha256-tree-hash name/value pair.

          (structure)
              A list of the part sizes of the multipart upload.

              RangeInBytes -> (string)
                 The byte range of a part, inclusive of the upper value of the
                 range.

              SHA256TreeHash -> (string)
                 The SHA256 tree hash value that Amazon S3 Glacier  calculated
                 for the part. This field is never null .

       Marker -> (string)
          An opaque string that represents where to continue pagination of the
          results. You use the marker in a new List Parts  request  to  obtain
          more  jobs  in  the  list. If there are no more parts, this value is
          null .
