NAME
       list-app-version-resource-mappings -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  how  the  resources in an application version are mapped/sourced
       from. Mappings can be  physical  resource  identifiers,  CloudFormation
       stacks, resource-groups, or an application registry app.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-app-version-resource-mappings
          --app-arn <value>
          --app-version <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --app-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the application. The format for
          this ARN is: arn:partition :dcps:region :account :app/app-id  .  For
          more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the
          AWS General Reference .

       --app-version (string)
          The version of the application.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to include in the  response.  If  more
          results  exist  than  the  specified  MaxResults  value,  a token is
          included in the response  so  that  the  remaining  results  can  be
          retrieved.

       --next-token (string)
          Null,  or  the  token  from  a  previous call to get the next set of
          results.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results, or null if there are no  more
          results.

       resourceMappings -> (list)
          Mappings used to map logical resources from the template to physical
          resources. You can use the mapping type CFN_STACK if the application
          template  uses  a  logical  stack  name.  Or  you can map individual
          resources by using the mapping type RESOURCE .  We  recommend  using
          the  mapping type CFN_STACK if the application is backed by a Cloud-
          Formation stack.

          (structure)
              Defines a resource mapping.

              appRegistryAppName -> (string)
                 The name of the application this resource is mapped to.

              logicalStackName -> (string)
                 The name of the CloudFormation stack this resource is  mapped
                 to.

              mappingType -> (string)
                 Specifies the type of resource mapping.
                     AppRegistryApp

                 The  resource  is  mapped to another application. The name of
                 the application is contained in the appRegistryAppName  prop-
                 erty.
                     CfnStack

                 The resource is mapped to a CloudFormation stack. The name of
                 the CloudFormation stack is contained in the logicalStackName
                 property.
                     Resource

                 The  resource  is mapped to another resource. The name of the
                 resource is contained in the resourceName property.
                     ResourceGroup

                 The resource is mapped to a resource group. The name  of  the
                 resource  group  is  contained in the resourceGroupName prop-
                 erty.

              physicalResourceId -> (structure)
                 The identifier of this resource.

                 awsAccountId -> (string)

                     resource.

                 awsRegion -> (string)
                     The Amazon Web Services Region that the physical resource
                     is located in.

                 identifier -> (string)
                     The identifier of the physical resource.

                 type -> (string)
                     Specifies the type of physical resource identifier.
                        Arn

                     The resource identifier is an Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)
