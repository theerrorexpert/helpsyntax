OPTIONS
       --data-location-constraint (string)
          Specifies  a  high-level  geographical location constraint for where
          your resilience policy data can be stored.

          Possible values:

          o AnyLocation

          o SameContinent

          o SameCountry

       --policy (map)
          The type of resiliency policy to be created, including the  recovery
          time  objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO) in seconds.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Defines a failure policy.

              rpoInSecs -> (integer)
                 The Recovery Point Objective (RPO), in seconds.

              rtoInSecs -> (integer)
                 The Recovery Time Objective (RTO), in seconds.

       Shorthand Syntax:

            KeyName1=rpoInSecs=integer,rtoInSecs=integer,KeyName2=rpoInSecs=integer,rtoInSecs=integer

          Where valid key names are:
            Software
            Hardware
            AZ
            Region

       JSON Syntax:

          {"Software"|"Hardware"|"AZ"|"Region": {
                "rpoInSecs": integer,
                "rtoInSecs": integer
              }
            ...}

       --policy-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resiliency policy. The  format
          for    this    ARN    is:    arn:partition   :dcps:region   :account
          :resiliency-policy/policy-id . For more information about ARNs,  see
          Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the AWS General Reference .

       --policy-description (string)
          The description for the policy.

       --policy-name (string)
          The name of the policy

       --tier (string)
          The tier for this resiliency policy, ranging from the highest sever-
          ity (MissionCritical ) to lowest (NonCritical ).

          Possible values:

          o MissionCritical

          o Critical

          o Important

          o CoreServices

          o NonCritical

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       policy -> (structure)
          The type of resiliency policy that was updated, including the recov-
          ery  time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO) in sec-
          onds.

          creationTime -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp for when the resiliency policy was created.

          dataLocationConstraint -> (string)
              Specifies a  high-level  geographical  location  constraint  for
              where your resilience policy data can be stored.

          estimatedCostTier -> (string)
              Specifies the estimated cost tier of the resiliency policy.

          policy -> (map)
              The resiliency policy.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                 Defines a failure policy.

                 rpoInSecs -> (integer)
                     The Recovery Point Objective (RPO), in seconds.

                 rtoInSecs -> (integer)

          policyArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the resiliency policy. The
