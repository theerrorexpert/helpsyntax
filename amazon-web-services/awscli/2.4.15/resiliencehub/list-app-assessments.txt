       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-app-assessments
          [--app-arn <value>]
          [--assessment-name <value>]
          [--assessment-status <value>]
          [--compliance-status <value>]

          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --app-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the application.  The  format  for
          this  ARN  is: arn:partition :dcps:region :account :app/app-id . For
          more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the
          AWS General Reference .

       --assessment-name (string)
          The name for the assessment.

       --assessment-status (list)
          The current status of the assessment for the resiliency policy.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            Pending
            InProgress
            Failed
            Success

       --compliance-status (string)
          The current status of compliance for the resiliency policy.

          Possible values:

          o PolicyBreached

          o PolicyMet

       --invoker (string)
          Specifies  the  entity  that invoked a specific assessment, either a
          User or the System .

          Possible values:

          o User

          o System

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to include in the  response.  If  more
          results  exist  than  the  specified  MaxResults  value,  a token is
          included in the response  so  that  the  remaining  results  can  be
          retrieved.

       --next-token (string)
          Null,  or  the  token  from  a  previous call to get the next set of
          results.

       --reverse-order | --no-reverse-order (boolean)
          The default is to sort by ascending startTime . To sort by  descend-
          ing startTime , set reverseOrder to true .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
