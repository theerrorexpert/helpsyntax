NAME
       list-suggested-resiliency-policies -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the suggested resiliency policies for the Resilience Hub applica-
       tions.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-suggested-resiliency-policies
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to include in the  response.  If  more
          results  exist  than  the  specified  MaxResults  value,  a token is
          included in the response  so  that  the  remaining  results  can  be
          retrieved.

       --next-token (string)
          Null,  or  the  token  from  a  previous call to get the next set of
          results.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results, or null if there are no  more
          results.

       resiliencyPolicies -> (list)
          The  suggested  resiliency  policies for the Resilience Hub applica-
          tions.

          (structure)
              Defines a resiliency policy.

              creationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp for when the resiliency policy was created.

              dataLocationConstraint -> (string)
                 Specifies a high-level geographical location  constraint  for
                 where your resilience policy data can be stored.

              estimatedCostTier -> (string)
                 Specifies the estimated cost tier of the resiliency policy.

              policy -> (map)
                 The resiliency policy.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     Defines a failure policy.

                     rpoInSecs -> (integer)
                        The Recovery Point Objective (RPO), in seconds.

                     rtoInSecs -> (integer)
                        The Recovery Time Objective (RTO), in seconds.

              policyArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resiliency policy. The
                 format for this ARN is: arn:partition  :dcps:region  :account
                 :resiliency-policy/policy-id  .  For  more  information about
                 ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)  in  the  AWS  General
                 Reference .

              policyDescription -> (string)
                 The description for the policy.

              policyName -> (string)
                 The name of the policy

              tags -> (map)
                 The  tags assigned to the resource. A tag is a label that you
                 assign to an Amazon Web Services resource. Each tag  consists
                 of a key/value pair.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              tier -> (string)
                 The tier for this resiliency policy, ranging from the highest
                 severity (MissionCritical ) to lowest (NonCritical ).
