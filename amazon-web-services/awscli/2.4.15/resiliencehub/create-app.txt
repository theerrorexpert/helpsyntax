CREATE-APP()                                                      CREATE-APP()



NAME
       create-app -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a Resilience Hub application. A Resilience Hub application is a
       collection of Amazon Web Services resources structured to  prevent  and
       recover  Amazon  Web  Services  application  disruptions. To describe a
       Resilience Hub application, you provide an application name,  resources
       from  one  or  moreup  to fiveCloudFormation stacks, and an appropriate
       resiliency policy.
          <p>After you create a Resilience Hub application, you publish it  so
          that  you  can  run  a resiliency assessment on it. You can then use
          recommendations from the assessment to improve resiliency by running
          another  assessment,  comparing  results,  and  then  iterating  the
          process until you achieve your goals  for  recovery  time  objective
          (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO).</p>

SYNOPSIS
            create-app
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--description <value>]
          --name <value>
          [--policy-arn <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Used for an idempotency token. A client token is a unique, case-sen-
          sitive string of up to 64 ASCII characters. You should not reuse the
          same client token for other API requests.

       --description (string)
          The optional description for an app.

       --name (string)
          The name for the application.

       --policy-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resiliency policy. The format
          for   this   ARN    is:    arn:partition    :dcps:region    :account
          :resiliency-policy/policy-id  . For more information about ARNs, see
          Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the AWS General Reference .

       --tags (map)
          The tags assigned to the resource. A tag is a label that you  assign
          to an Amazon Web Services resource. Each tag consists of a key/value
          pair.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       app -> (structure)
          The created application returned as an object with details including
          compliance status, creation time, description, resiliency score, and
          more.

          appArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  application.  The  format
              for this ARN is: arn:partition :dcps:region :account :app/app-id
              . For more information about ARNs,  see  Amazon  Resource  Names
              (ARNs) in the AWS General Reference .

          complianceStatus -> (string)
              The current status of compliance for the resiliency policy.

          creationTime -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp for when the app was created.

          description -> (string)
              The optional description for an app.

          lastAppComplianceEvaluationTime -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp for the most recent compliance evaluation.

          lastResiliencyScoreEvaluationTime -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp for the most recent resiliency score evaluation.

          name -> (string)
              The name for the application.

          policyArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the resiliency policy. The
              format for this  ARN  is:  arn:partition  :dcps:region  :account
              :resiliency-policy/policy-id  . For more information about ARNs,
              see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the AWS General Reference  .

          resiliencyScore -> (double)
              The current resiliency score for the application.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the action.

          tags -> (map)
              The  tags  assigned  to  the resource. A tag is a label that you
