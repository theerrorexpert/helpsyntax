NAME
       describe-resiliency-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  a  specified  resiliency  policy  for  an AWS Resilience Hub
       application. The returned policy object includes  creation  time,  data
       location  constraints,  the  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the policy,
       tags, tier, and more.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-resiliency-policy
          --policy-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --policy-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resiliency policy. The  format
          for    this    ARN    is:    arn:partition   :dcps:region   :account
          :resiliency-policy/policy-id . For more information about ARNs,  see
          Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the AWS General Reference .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       policy -> (structure)
          Information  about  the  specific  resiliency policy, returned as an
          object. This object  includes  creation  time,  data  location  con-
          straints,  its  name, description, tags, the recovery time objective
          (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO) in seconds, and more.

          creationTime -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp for when the resiliency policy was created.

          dataLocationConstraint -> (string)
              Specifies a  high-level  geographical  location  constraint  for
              where your resilience policy data can be stored.

          estimatedCostTier -> (string)
              Specifies the estimated cost tier of the resiliency policy.

          policy -> (map)
              The resiliency policy.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                 Defines a failure policy.

                 rpoInSecs -> (integer)
                     The Recovery Point Objective (RPO), in seconds.

                 rtoInSecs -> (integer)
                     The Recovery Time Objective (RTO), in seconds.

          policyArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the resiliency policy. The
              format for this  ARN  is:  arn:partition  :dcps:region  :account
              :resiliency-policy/policy-id  . For more information about ARNs,
              see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the AWS General Reference  .

          policyDescription -> (string)
              The description for the policy.

          policyName -> (string)
              The name of the policy

          tags -> (map)
              The  tags  assigned  to  the resource. A tag is a label that you
              assign to an Amazon Web Services resource. Each tag consists  of
              a key/value pair.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          tier -> (string)
              The  tier  for  this resiliency policy, ranging from the highest
              severity (MissionCritical ) to lowest (NonCritical ).
