NAME
       list-apps -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists your Resilience Hub applications.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-apps
          [--app-arn <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--name <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --app-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the application. The format for
          this ARN is: arn:partition :dcps:region :account :app/app-id  .  For
          more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the
          AWS General Reference .

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to include in the  response.  If  more
          results  exist  than  the  specified  MaxResults  value,  a token is
          included in the response  so  that  the  remaining  results  can  be
          retrieved.

       --name (string)
          The name for the one of the listed applications.

       --next-token (string)
          Null,  or  the  token  from  a  previous call to get the next set of
          results.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              appArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the application. The format
                 for   this   ARN   is:  arn:partition  :dcps:region  :account
                 :app/app-id . For more information  about  ARNs,  see  Amazon
                 Resource Names (ARNs) in the AWS General Reference .

              complianceStatus -> (string)
                 The current status of compliance for the resiliency policy.

              creationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp for when the app was created.

              description -> (string)
                 The optional description for an app.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the application.

              resiliencyScore -> (double)
                 The current resiliency score for the application.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  token for the next set of results, or null if there are no more
