SYNOPSIS
            add-draft-app-version-resource-mappings
          --app-arn <value>
          --resource-mappings <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --app-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the application. The format for
          this ARN is: arn:partition :dcps:region :account :app/app-id  .  For
          more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the
          AWS General Reference .

       --resource-mappings (list)
          Mappings used to map logical resources from the template to physical
          resources. You can use the mapping type CFN_STACK if the application
          template uses a logical  stack  name.  Or  you  can  map  individual
          resources  by  using  the mapping type RESOURCE . We recommend using
          the mapping type CFN_STACK if the application is backed by a  Cloud-
          Formation stack.

          (structure)
              Defines a resource mapping.

              appRegistryAppName -> (string)

                     tifier.

              resourceGroupName -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          appRegistryAppName=string,logicalStackName=string,mappingType=string,physicalResourceId={awsAccountId=string,awsRegion=string,identifier=string,type=string},resourceGroupName=string,resourceName=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "appRegistryAppName": "string",
              "logicalStackName": "string",
              "mappingType": "CfnStack"|"Resource"|"AppRegistryApp"|"ResourceGroup",
              "physicalResourceId": {
                "awsAccountId": "string",
                "awsRegion": "string",
                "identifier": "string",
                "type": "Arn"|"Native"
              },
              "resourceGroupName": "string",
              "resourceName": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
