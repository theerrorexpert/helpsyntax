DESCRIBE-APP()                                                  DESCRIBE-APP()



NAME
       describe-app -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes an AWS Resilience Hub application.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-app
          --app-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --app-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the application. The format for
          this ARN is: arn:partition :dcps:region :account :app/app-id  .  For
          more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the
          AWS General Reference .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       app -> (structure)
          The specified  application,  returned  as  an  object  with  details
          including  compliance status, creation time, description, resiliency
          score, and more.

          appArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  application.  The  format
              for this ARN is: arn:partition :dcps:region :account :app/app-id
              . For more information about ARNs,  see  Amazon  Resource  Names
              (ARNs) in the AWS General Reference .

          complianceStatus -> (string)
              The current status of compliance for the resiliency policy.

          creationTime -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp for when the app was created.

          description -> (string)
              The optional description for an app.

          lastAppComplianceEvaluationTime -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp for the most recent compliance evaluation.

          lastResiliencyScoreEvaluationTime -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp for the most recent resiliency score evaluation.

          name -> (string)
              The name for the application.

          policyArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the resiliency policy. The
              format for this  ARN  is:  arn:partition  :dcps:region  :account
              :resiliency-policy/policy-id  . For more information about ARNs,
              see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the AWS General Reference  .

          resiliencyScore -> (double)
              The current resiliency score for the application.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the action.

          tags -> (map)
              The  tags  assigned  to  the resource. A tag is a label that you
              assign to an Amazon Web Services resource. Each tag consists  of
              a key/value pair.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)



                                                                DESCRIBE-APP()
