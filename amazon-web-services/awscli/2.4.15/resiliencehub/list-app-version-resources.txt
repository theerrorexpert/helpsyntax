DESCRIPTION
       Lists all the resources in an application version.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-app-version-resources
          --app-arn <value>
          --app-version <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--resolution-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --app-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the application. The format for
          this ARN is: arn:partition :dcps:region :account :app/app-id  .  For
          more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the
          AWS General Reference .

       --app-version (string)
          The version of the application.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to include in the  response.  If  more
          results  exist  than  the  specified  MaxResults  value,  a token is
          included in the response  so  that  the  remaining  results  can  be
          retrieved.

       --next-token (string)
          Null,  or  the  token  from  a  previous call to get the next set of
          results.

       --resolution-id (string)
          The identifier for a specific resolution.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT

              logicalResourceId -> (structure)
                 The logical identifier of the resource.

                 identifier -> (string)

                 logicalStackName -> (string)
                     The  name  of  the  CloudFormation  stack  this  resource
                     belongs to.

                 resourceGroupName -> (string)
                     The name of the resource group that this resource belongs
                     to.

              physicalResourceId -> (structure)
                 The physical identifier of the resource.

                 awsAccountId -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Web  Services account that owns the physical
                     resource.

                 awsRegion -> (string)
                     The Amazon Web Services Region that the physical resource
                     is located in.

                 identifier -> (string)
                     The identifier of the physical resource.

                 type -> (string)
                     Specifies the type of physical resource identifier.
                        Arn

                     The  resource identifier is an Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                     .
                        Native

                     The resource identifier is a Resilience Hub-native  iden-
                     tifier.

              resourceName -> (string)
                 The name of the resource.
