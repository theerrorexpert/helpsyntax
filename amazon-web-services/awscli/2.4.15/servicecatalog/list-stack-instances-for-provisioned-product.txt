       list-stack-instances-for-provisioned-product -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  summary  information about stack instances that are associated
       with the specified CFN_STACKSET type provisioned product. You can  fil-
       ter for stack instances that are associated with a specific AWS account
       name or region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-stack-instances-for-provisioned-product
          [--accept-language <value>]
          --provisioned-product-id <value>
          [--page-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --accept-language (string)
          The language code.

          o en - English (default)

          o jp - Japanese

          o zh - Chinese

       --provisioned-product-id (string)
          The identifier of the provisioned product.

       --page-token (string)
          The page token for the next set of results. To  retrieve  the  first
          set of results, use null.

       --page-size (integer)
          The maximum number of items to return with this call.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       StackInstances -> (list)
          List of stack instances.

          (structure)
              An  AWS  CloudFormation stack, in a specific account and region,
              that's part of a stack set operation. A stack instance is a ref-
              erence to an attempted or actual stack in a given account within
              a given region. A stack instance can exist  without  a  stackfor
              example,  if  the  stack  couldn't be created for some reason. A
              stack instance is associated with only one stack set. Each stack
              instance contains the ID of its associated stack set, as well as
              the ID of the actual stack and the stack status.

              Account -> (string)
                 The name of the AWS account that the stack instance is  asso-
                 ciated with.

              Region -> (string)
                 The name of the AWS region that the stack instance is associ-
                 ated with.

              StackInstanceStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the stack instance, in terms  of  its  synchro-
                 nization with its associated stack set.

                 o INOPERABLE  :  A  DeleteStackInstances operation has failed
                   and left the stack in an unstable  state.  Stacks  in  this
                   state  are excluded from further UpdateStackSet operations.
                   You might need to perform a DeleteStackInstances operation,
                   with   RetainStacks  set  to  true,  to  delete  the  stack
                   instance, and then delete the stack manually.

                 o OUTDATED : The stack isn't currently up to  date  with  the
                   stack set because either the associated stack failed during
                   a CreateStackSet or UpdateStackSet operation, or the  stack
                   was  part  of  a CreateStackSet or UpdateStackSet operation
                   that failed or was stopped before the stack was created  or
                   updated.

                 o CURRENT  : The stack is currently up to date with the stack
                   set.

       NextPageToken -> (string)
          The page token to use to retrieve the next set of results. If  there
          are no additional results, this value is null.
