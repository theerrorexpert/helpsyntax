SYNOPSIS
            update-provisioned-product-properties
          [--accept-language <value>]
          --provisioned-product-id <value>
          --provisioned-product-properties <value>
          [--idempotency-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --accept-language (string)
          The language code.

          o en - English (default)

          o jp - Japanese

          o zh - Chinese

       --provisioned-product-id (string)
          The identifier of the provisioned product.

       --provisioned-product-properties (map)
          A map  that  contains  the  provisioned  product  properties  to  be
          updated.

          The  LAUNCH_ROLE  key accepts role ARNs. This key allows an adminis-
          trator to  call  UpdateProvisionedProductProperties  to  update  the
          launch role that is associated with a provisioned product. This role
          is used when an end user calls  a  provisioning  operation  such  as
          UpdateProvisionedProduct  ,  TerminateProvisionedProduct  ,  or Exe-
          cuteProvisionedProductServiceAction . Only a role ARN  is  valid.  A
          user ARN is invalid.

          The OWNER key accepts user ARNs and role ARNs. The owner is the user
          that has permission to see, update, terminate, and  execute  service
          actions in the provisioned product.

          The  administrator  can change the owner of a provisioned product to
          another IAM user within the same account. Both end user  owners  and
          administrators  can see ownership history of the provisioned product
          using the ListRecordHistory API. The new owner can describe all past
          records  for  the  provisioned product using the DescribeRecord API.
          The previous owner can no longer use DescribeRecord , but can  still
          see   the  product's  history  from  when  he  was  an  owner  using
          ListRecordHistory .

          If a provisioned product ownership is assigned to an end user,  they
          can  see  and  perform any action through the API or Service Catalog
          console such as update, terminate, and execute service  actions.  If
          an end user provisions a product and the owner is updated to someone
          else, they will no longer be able to  see  or  perform  any  actions
          through API or the Service Catalog console on that provisioned prod-
          uct.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

            KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

          Where valid key names are:
            OWNER
            LAUNCH_ROLE

       JSON Syntax:

          {"OWNER"|"LAUNCH_ROLE": "string"
            ...}

       --idempotency-token (string)
          The idempotency token  that  uniquely  identifies  the  provisioning
          product update request.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ProvisionedProductId -> (string)
          The provisioned product identifier.

       ProvisionedProductProperties -> (map)
          A map that contains the properties updated.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       RecordId -> (string)
          The identifier of the record.
