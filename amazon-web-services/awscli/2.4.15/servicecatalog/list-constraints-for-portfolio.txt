NAME
       list-constraints-for-portfolio -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the constraints for the specified portfolio and product.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-constraints-for-portfolio  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: ConstraintDetails

SYNOPSIS
            list-constraints-for-portfolio
          [--accept-language <value>]
          --portfolio-id <value>
          [--product-id <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --accept-language (string)
          The language code.

          o en - English (default)

          o jp - Japanese

          o zh - Chinese

       --portfolio-id (string)
          The portfolio identifier.

       --product-id (string)
          The product identifier.

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ConstraintDetails -> (list)
          Information about the constraints.

          (structure)
              Information about a constraint.

              ConstraintId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the constraint.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of constraint.

                 o LAUNCH

                 o NOTIFICATION

                 o STACKSET

                 o TEMPLATE

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the constraint.

              Owner -> (string)
                 The owner of the constraint.

              ProductId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the product the constraint applies to. Note
                 that a constraint applies to a specific instance of a product
                 within a certain portfolio.

              PortfolioId -> (string)
                 The  identifier  of the portfolio the product resides in. The
                 constraint applies only to the instance of the  product  that
                 lives within this portfolio.

       NextPageToken -> (string)
          The  page token to use to retrieve the next set of results. If there
          are no additional results, this value is null.
