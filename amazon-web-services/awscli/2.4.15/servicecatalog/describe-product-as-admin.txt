       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-product-as-admin
          [--accept-language <value>]
          [--id <value>]
          [--name <value>]
          [--source-portfolio-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --accept-language (string)
          The language code.

          o en - English (default)

          o jp - Japanese

          o zh - Chinese

       --id (string)
          The product identifier.

       --name (string)
          The product name.

       --source-portfolio-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the shared  portfolio  that  the  specified
          product is associated with.

          You  can  provide  this  parameter to retrieve the shared TagOptions
          associated with the product. If this parameter is  provided  and  if
          TagOptions  sharing  is  enabled  in  the  portfolio  share, the API
          returns both local and shared TagOptions associated with  the  prod-
          uct. Otherwise only local TagOptions will be returned.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
