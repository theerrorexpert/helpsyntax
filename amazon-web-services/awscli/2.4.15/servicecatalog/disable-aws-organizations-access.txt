NAME
       disable-aws-organizations-access -

DESCRIPTION
       Disable  portfolio sharing through AWS Organizations feature. This fea-
       ture will not delete your current shares but it will prevent  you  from
       creating  new  shares throughout your organization. Current shares will
       not be in sync with your organization structure  if  it  changes  after
       calling this API. This API can only be called by the management account
       in the organization.

       This API can't be invoked if there are active delegated  administrators
       in the organization.

       Note  that  a  delegated administrator is not authorized to invoke Dis-
       ableAWSOrganizationsAccess .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disable-aws-organizations-access
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
