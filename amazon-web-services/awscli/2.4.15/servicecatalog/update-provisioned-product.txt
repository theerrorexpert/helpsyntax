       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string,UsePreviousValue=boolean ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string",
              "UsePreviousValue": true|false
            }
            ...
          ]

       --provisioning-preferences (structure)
          An  object  that contains information about the provisioning prefer-
          ences for a stack set.

          StackSetAccounts -> (list)
              One or more AWS accounts that will have  access  to  the  provi-
              sioned product.

              Applicable only to a CFN_STACKSET provisioned product type.

              The AWS accounts specified should be within the list of accounts
              in the STACKSET constraint. To get the list of accounts  in  the
              STACKSET   constraint,  use  the  DescribeProvisioningParameters
              operation.

              If no values are specified, the default value  is  all  accounts
              from the STACKSET constraint.

              (string)

          StackSetRegions -> (list)
              One  or  more  AWS Regions where the provisioned product will be
              available.

              Applicable only to a CFN_STACKSET provisioned product type.

              The specified regions should be within the list of regions  from
              the  STACKSET  constraint.  To  get  the  list of regions in the
              STACKSET  constraint,  use  the   DescribeProvisioningParameters
              operation.

              If  no  values  are  specified, the default value is all regions
              from the STACKSET constraint.

              (string)

          StackSetFailureToleranceCount -> (integer)
              The number of accounts, per region, for which this operation can
              fail  before  AWS  Service  Catalog  stops the operation in that
              region. If the operation is stopped in  a  region,  AWS  Service
              Catalog doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent regions.

              Applicable only to a CFN_STACKSET provisioned product type.

              Conditional: You must specify  either  StackSetFailureTolerance-
              Count or StackSetFailureTolerancePercentage , but not both.

              The default value is 0 if no value is specified.

          StackSetFailureTolerancePercentage -> (integer)
              The  percentage  of  accounts,  per region, for which this stack
              operation can fail before AWS Service Catalog stops  the  opera-
              tion  in  that  region. If the operation is stopped in a region,
              AWS Service Catalog doesn't attempt the operation in any  subse-
              quent regions.

              When  calculating  the number of accounts based on the specified
              percentage, AWS Service Catalog rounds down to  the  next  whole
              number.

              Applicable only to a CFN_STACKSET provisioned product type.

              Conditional:  You  must specify either StackSetFailureTolerance-
              Count or StackSetFailureTolerancePercentage , but not both.

          StackSetMaxConcurrencyCount -> (integer)
              The maximum number of accounts in which to perform  this  opera-
              tion  at  one  time. This is dependent on the value of StackSet-
              FailureToleranceCount . StackSetMaxConcurrentCount  is  at  most
              one more than the StackSetFailureToleranceCount .

              Note  that  this setting lets you specify the maximum for opera-
              tions. For large deployments, under  certain  circumstances  the
              actual  number  of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower
              due to service throttling.

              Applicable only to a CFN_STACKSET provisioned product type.

              Conditional: You must specify either  StackSetMaxConcurrentCount
              or StackSetMaxConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

          StackSetMaxConcurrencyPercentage -> (integer)
              The  maximum  percentage  of  accounts  in which to perform this
              operation at one time.

              When calculating the number of accounts based on  the  specified
              percentage,  AWS  Service  Catalog rounds down to the next whole
              number. This is true except in cases where rounding  down  would
              result  is zero. In this case, AWS Service Catalog sets the num-
              ber as 1 instead.

              Note that this setting lets you specify the maximum  for  opera-
              tions.  For  large  deployments, under certain circumstances the
              actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may  be  lower
              due to service throttling.

              Applicable only to a CFN_STACKSET provisioned product type.

              Conditional:  You must specify either StackSetMaxConcurrentCount
              or StackSetMaxConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

          StackSetOperationType -> (string)
              Determines what action AWS Service Catalog performs to  a  stack
              set  or a stack instance represented by the provisioned product.
              The default value is UPDATE if nothing is specified.

              Applicable only to a CFN_STACKSET provisioned product type.
                 CREATE

              Creates a new stack instance in the stack set represented by the
              provisioned  product. In this case, only new stack instances are
              created based on accounts and regions; if new ProductId or  Pro-
              visioningArtifactID are passed, they will be ignored.
                 UPDATE

              Updates the stack set represented by the provisioned product and
              also its stack instances.
                 DELETE

              Deletes a stack instance in the stack  set  represented  by  the
              provisioned product.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          StackSetAccounts=string,string,StackSetRegions=string,string,StackSetFailureToleranceCount=integer,StackSetFailureTolerancePercentage=integer,StackSetMaxConcurrencyCount=integer,StackSetMaxConcurrencyPercentage=integer,StackSetOperationType=string

          }

       --tags (list)
          One  or more tags. Requires the product to have RESOURCE_UPDATE con-
          straint with TagUpdatesOnProvisionedProduct set to ALLOWED to  allow
          tag updates.

          (structure)
              Information  about  a  tag.  A tag is a key-value pair. Tags are
              propagated to the resources created when provisioning a product.

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag key.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for this key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --update-token (string)
          The  idempotency  token  that  uniquely  identifies the provisioning
          update request.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
