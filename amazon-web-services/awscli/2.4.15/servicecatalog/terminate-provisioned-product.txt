SYNOPSIS
            terminate-provisioned-product
          [--provisioned-product-name <value>]
          [--provisioned-product-id <value>]
          [--terminate-token <value>]
          [--ignore-errors | --no-ignore-errors]
          [--accept-language <value>]
          [--retain-physical-resources | --no-retain-physical-resources]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --provisioned-product-name (string)
          The name of the provisioned product. You cannot specify both  Provi-
          sionedProductName and ProvisionedProductId .

       --provisioned-product-id (string)
          The  identifier  of the provisioned product. You cannot specify both
          ProvisionedProductName and ProvisionedProductId .

       --terminate-token (string)
          An  idempotency  token  that  uniquely  identifies  the  termination
          request.  This  token  is only valid during the termination process.
          After the provisioned product is terminated, subsequent requests  to
          terminate  the  same  provisioned product always return ResourceNot-
          Found .

       --ignore-errors | --no-ignore-errors (boolean)
          If set to true, AWS Service Catalog  stops  managing  the  specified
          provisioned   product  even  if  it  cannot  delete  the  underlying
          resources.

       --accept-language (string)
          The language code.

          o en - English (default)

          o jp - Japanese

          o zh - Chinese

       --retain-physical-resources | --no-retain-physical-resources (boolean)
          When this boolean parameter is  set  to  true,  the  TerminateProvi-
          sionedProduct  API  deletes the Service Catalog provisioned product.
          However, it does not remove the CloudFormation stack, stack set,  or
          the  underlying  resources  of  the deleted provisioned product. The
          default value is false.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
