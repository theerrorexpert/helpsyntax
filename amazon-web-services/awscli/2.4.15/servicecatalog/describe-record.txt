DESCRIBE-RECORD()                                            DESCRIBE-RECORD()



NAME
       describe-record -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about the specified request operation.

       Use  this  operation  after  calling  a request operation (for example,
       ProvisionProduct  ,   TerminateProvisionedProduct  ,  or   UpdateProvi-
       sionedProduct ).

       NOTE:
          If  a  provisioned  product  was  transferred  to  a new owner using
          UpdateProvisionedProductProperties , the new owner will be  able  to
          describe  all past records for that product. The previous owner will
          no longer be able to describe the records, but will be able  to  use
          ListRecordHistory  to see the product's history from when he was the
          owner.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-record
          [--accept-language <value>]
          --id <value>
          [--page-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --accept-language (string)
          The language code.

          o en - English (default)

          o jp - Japanese

          o zh - Chinese

       --id (string)
          The record identifier of the provisioned product. This identifier is
          returned by the request operation.

       --page-token (string)
          The  page  token  for the next set of results. To retrieve the first
          set of results, use null.

       --page-size (integer)
          The maximum number of items to return with this call.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
