NAME
       scan-provisioned-products -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the provisioned products that are available (not terminated).

       To use additional filtering, see  SearchProvisionedProducts .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       scan-provisioned-products  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: ProvisionedProducts

SYNOPSIS
            scan-provisioned-products
          [--accept-language <value>]
          [--access-level-filter <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --accept-language (string)
          The language code.

          o en - English (default)

          o jp - Japanese

          o zh - Chinese

       --access-level-filter (structure)
          The access level to use to obtain results. The default is User .

          Key -> (string)
              The access level.

              o Account - Filter results based on the account.

              o Role - Filter results based on the federated role of the spec-
                ified user.

              o User - Filter results based on the specified user.

          Value -> (string)
              The  user  to which the access level applies. The only supported
              value is Self .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Key": "Account"|"Role"|"User",
            "Value": "string"
          }

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list all available provisioned products

       The  following scan-provisioned-products example lists available provi-
       sioned products.

          aws servicecatalog scan-provisioned-products

       Output:

          {
              "ProvisionedProducts": [
                  {

          }

OUTPUT
       ProvisionedProducts -> (list)
          Information about the provisioned products.

          (structure)
              Information about a provisioned product.

              Name -> (string)
                 The user-friendly name of the provisioned product.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the provisioned product.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of provisioned product.  The  supported  values  are
                 CFN_STACK and CFN_STACKSET .

              Id -> (string)
                 The identifier of the provisioned product.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current status of the provisioned product.

                 o AVAILABLE  -  Stable state, ready to perform any operation.
                   The most recent operation succeeded and completed.

                 o UNDER_CHANGE - Transitive state. Operations performed might
                   not have valid results. Wait for an AVAILABLE status before
                   performing operations.

                 o TAINTED - Stable state, ready to perform any operation. The
                   stack  has  completed  the  requested  operation but is not
                   exactly what was  requested.  For  example,  a  request  to
                   update to a new version failed and the stack rolled back to
                   the current version.

                 o ERROR - An unexpected error occurred. The provisioned prod-
                   uct  exists  but  the  stack  is  not running. For example,
                   CloudFormation received a  parameter  value  that  was  not
                   valid and could not launch the stack.

                 o PLAN_IN_PROGRESS  -  Transitive  state. The plan operations
                   were performed to provision a new  product,  but  resources
                   have  not  yet  been  created.  After reviewing the list of
                   resources to be created, execute  the  plan.  Wait  for  an
                   AVAILABLE status before performing operations.

              StatusMessage -> (string)
                 The current status message of the provisioned product.

              CreatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The UTC time stamp of the creation time.

              IdempotencyToken -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier that you provide to ensure idempotency.
                 If multiple requests differ only by  the  idempotency  token,
                 the same response is returned for each repeated request.

              LastRecordId -> (string)
                 The  record  identifier of the last request performed on this
                 provisioned product.

              LastProvisioningRecordId -> (string)
                 The record identifier of the last request performed  on  this
                 provisioned product of the following types:

                 o ProvisionedProduct

                 o UpdateProvisionedProduct

                 o ExecuteProvisionedProductPlan

                 o TerminateProvisionedProduct

              LastSuccessfulProvisioningRecordId -> (string)
                 The  record  identifier  of  the last successful request per-
                 formed on this provisioned product of the following types:

                 o ProvisionedProduct

                 o UpdateProvisionedProduct

                 o ExecuteProvisionedProductPlan

                 o TerminateProvisionedProduct

              ProductId -> (string)
                 The product identifier. For example, prod-abcdzk7xy33qa .

              ProvisioningArtifactId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the  provisioning  artifact.  For  example,
                 pa-4abcdjnxjj6ne .

              LaunchRoleArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of  the launch role associated with the provisioned
                 product.

       NextPageToken -> (string)
          The page token to use to retrieve the next set of results. If  there
          are no additional results, this value is null.
