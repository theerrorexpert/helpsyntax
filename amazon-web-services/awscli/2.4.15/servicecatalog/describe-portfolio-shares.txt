NAME
       describe-portfolio-shares -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a summary of each of the portfolio shares that were created for
       the specified portfolio.

       You can use this API to  determine  which  accounts  or  organizational
       nodes this portfolio have been shared, whether the recipient entity has
       imported the share, and whether TagOptions are included with the share.

       The PortfolioId and Type parameters are both required.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-portfolio-shares
          --portfolio-id <value>
          --type <value>
          [--page-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --portfolio-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier  of  the  portfolio for which shares will be
          retrieved.

       --type (string)
          The type of portfolio share to summarize. This field acts as a  fil-
          ter  on the type of portfolio share, which can be one of the follow-
          ing:

          1. ACCOUNT - Represents an external account to account share.

          2. ORGANIZATION - Represents a share to an organization. This  share
             is available to every account in the organization.

          3. ORGANIZATIONAL_UNIT  -  Represents  a  share to an organizational
             unit.

          4. ORGANIZATION_MEMBER_ACCOUNT - Represents a share to an account in
             the organization.

          Possible values:

          o ACCOUNT

          o ORGANIZATION

          o ORGANIZATIONAL_UNIT

          o ORGANIZATION_MEMBER_ACCOUNT

       --page-token (string)
          The  page  token  for the next set of results. To retrieve the first
          set of results, use null.

       --page-size (integer)
          The maximum number of items to return with this call.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextPageToken -> (string)
          The page token to use to retrieve the next set of results. If  there
          are no additional results, this value is null.

       PortfolioShareDetails -> (list)
          Summaries about each of the portfolio shares.

          (structure)
              Information about the portfolio share.

              PrincipalId -> (string)
                 The  identifier  of  the  recipient  entity that received the
                 portfolio share. The recipient entities can  be  one  of  the
                 following:

                 1. An external account.

                 2. An organziation member account.

                 3. An organzational unit (OU).

                 4. The  organization  itself. (This shares with every account
                    in the organization).

                 The type of the portfolio share.

                 Indicates whether the shared portfolio  is  imported  by  the
                 recipient  account.  If  the  recipient is in an organization
                 node, the share is automatically imported, and the  field  is
                 always set to true.

              ShareTagOptions -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  TagOptions sharing is enabled or disabled
