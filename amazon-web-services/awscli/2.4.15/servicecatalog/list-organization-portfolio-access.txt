NAME
       list-organization-portfolio-access -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the organization nodes that have access to the specified portfo-
       lio. This API can only be called by the management account in the orga-
       nization or by a delegated admin.

       If  a delegated admin is de-registered, they can no longer perform this
       operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-organization-portfolio-access is a paginated  operation.  Multiple
       API  calls  may  be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: OrganizationNodes

SYNOPSIS
            list-organization-portfolio-access
          [--accept-language <value>]
          --portfolio-id <value>
          --organization-node-type <value>
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --accept-language (string)
          The language code.

          o en - English (default)

          o jp - Japanese

          o zh - Chinese

       --portfolio-id (string)
          The portfolio identifier. For example, port-2abcdext3y5fk .

       --organization-node-type (string)
          The organization node type that will be returned in the output.

          o ORGANIZATION - Organization that has access to the portfolio.

          o ORGANIZATIONAL_UNIT  -  Organizational unit that has access to the
            portfolio within your organization.

          o ACCOUNT - Account that has access to  the  portfolio  within  your
            organization.

          o ORGANIZATIONAL_UNIT

          o ACCOUNT

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       OrganizationNodes -> (list)
          Displays information about the organization nodes.

          (structure)
              Information about the organization node.

              Type -> (string)
                 The organization node type.

              Value -> (string)
                 The identifier of the organization node.

       NextPageToken -> (string)
          The page token to use to retrieve the next set of results. If  there
          are no additional results, this value is null.
