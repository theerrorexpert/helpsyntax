DESCRIPTION

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-provisioned-product
          [--accept-language <value>]
          [--id <value>]
          [--name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --accept-language (string)
          The language code.

          o en - English (default)

          o jp - Japanese

          o zh - Chinese

       --id (string)
          The provisioned product identifier. You must provide the name or ID,
          but not both.

          If you do not provide a name or ID, or you provide both name and ID,
          an InvalidParametersException will occur.

       --name (string)
          The  name  of  the provisioned product. You must provide the name or
          ID, but not both.

          If you do not provide a name or ID, or you provide both name and ID,
          an InvalidParametersException will occur.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ProvisionedProductDetail -> (structure)
          Information about the provisioned product.

          Name -> (string)
              The user-friendly name of the provisioned product.

          Arn -> (string)
              The ARN of the provisioned product.

          Type -> (string)
              The type  of  provisioned  product.  The  supported  values  are
              CFN_STACK and CFN_STACKSET .

          Id -> (string)
              The identifier of the provisioned product.

          Status -> (string)
              The current status of the provisioned product.

              o AVAILABLE  - Stable state, ready to perform any operation. The
                most recent operation succeeded and completed.

              o UNDER_CHANGE - Transitive state.  Operations  performed  might
                not  have  valid  results. Wait for an AVAILABLE status before
                performing operations.

              o TAINTED - Stable state, ready to perform  any  operation.  The
                stack has completed the requested operation but is not exactly
                what was requested. For example, a request to update to a  new
                version  failed  and the stack rolled back to the current ver-
                sion.

              o ERROR - An unexpected error occurred. The provisioned  product
                exists  but the stack is not running. For example, CloudForma-
                tion received a parameter value that was not valid  and  could
                not launch the stack.

              o PLAN_IN_PROGRESS  - Transitive state. The plan operations were
                performed to provision a new product, but resources  have  not
                yet  been created. After reviewing the list of resources to be
                created, execute the plan. Wait for an AVAILABLE status before
                performing operations.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              The current status message of the provisioned product.

          CreatedTime -> (timestamp)
              The UTC time stamp of the creation time.

          IdempotencyToken -> (string)
              A  unique  identifier that you provide to ensure idempotency. If
              multiple requests differ only by the idempotency token, the same
              response is returned for each repeated request.

          LastRecordId -> (string)
              The record identifier of the last request performed on this pro-
              visioned product.

          LastProvisioningRecordId -> (string)
              The record identifier of the last request performed on this pro-
              visioned product of the following types:

              o ProvisionedProduct

              o UpdateProvisionedProduct

              o ExecuteProvisionedProductPlan

              o TerminateProvisionedProduct

          LastSuccessfulProvisioningRecordId -> (string)
              The  record  identifier of the last successful request performed
              on this provisioned product of the following types:

              o ProvisionedProduct

              o UpdateProvisionedProduct

              o ExecuteProvisionedProductPlan

              o TerminateProvisionedProduct

          ProductId -> (string)
              The product identifier. For example, prod-abcdzk7xy33qa .

          ProvisioningArtifactId -> (string)
              The  identifier  of  the  provisioning  artifact.  For  example,
              pa-4abcdjnxjj6ne .

          LaunchRoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the launch role associated with the provisioned prod-
              uct.

       CloudWatchDashboards -> (list)
