OPTIONS
       --accept-language (string)
          The language code.

          o en - English (default)

          o jp - Japanese

          o zh - Chinese

       --filters (map)
          The  search  filters. If no search filters are specified, the output
          includes all products to which the caller has access.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

            KeyName1=string,string,KeyName2=string,string

          Where valid key names are:
            FullTextSearch
            Owner
            ProductType
            SourceProductId

       JSON Syntax:

          {"FullTextSearch"|"Owner"|"ProductType"|"SourceProductId": ["string", ...]
            ...}

       --page-size (integer)
          The maximum number of items to return with this call.

       --sort-by (string)
          The sort field. If no  value  is  specified,  the  results  are  not
          sorted.

          Possible values:

          o Title

          o VersionCount

          o CreationDate

       --sort-order (string)
          The  sort  order.  If  no  value  is  specified, the results are not
          sorted.

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --page-token (string)
          The page token for the next set of results. To  retrieve  the  first
          set of results, use null.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       ProductViewSummaries -> (list)
          Information about the product views.

          (structure)

                     value.
