ADD-PERMISSION()                                              ADD-PERMISSION()



NAME
       add-permission -

DESCRIPTION
       Grants  an Amazon Web Services service or another account permission to
       use a function. You can apply the policy  at  the  function  level,  or
       specify a qualifier to restrict access to a single version or alias. If
       you use a qualifier, the invoker must use the full Amazon Resource Name
       (ARN)  of  that  version  or alias to invoke the function. Note: Lambda
       does not support adding policies to version $LATEST.

       To grant permission to another account, specify the account ID  as  the
       Principal  .  For  Amazon  Web  Services  services,  the principal is a
       domain-style identifier defined by the service,  like  s3.amazonaws.com
       or  sns.amazonaws.com  . For Amazon Web Services services, you can also
       specify the ARN of the associated resource as the SourceArn  .  If  you
       grant  permission to a service principal without specifying the source,
       other accounts could potentially configure resources in  their  account
       to invoke your Lambda function.

       This action adds a statement to a resource-based permissions policy for
       the function. For more information about function policies, see  Lambda
       Function Policies .

SYNOPSIS
            add-permission
          --function-name <value>
          --statement-id <value>
          --action <value>
          --principal <value>
          [--source-arn <value>]
          [--source-account <value>]
          [--event-source-token <value>]
          [--qualifier <value>]
          [--revision-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --function-name (string)
          The name of the Lambda function, version, or alias.
              Name formats

          o Function  name  -  my-function  (name-only),  my-function:v1 (with
            alias).

          o Function   ARN    -    arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:func-
            tion:my-function .

          o Partial ARN - 123456789012:function:my-function .

          You  can append a version number or alias to any of the formats. The
          length constraint applies only to the full ARN. If you specify  only
          the function name, it is limited to 64 characters in length.

       --statement-id (string)
          A statement identifier that differentiates the statement from others
          in the same policy.

       --action (string)
          The action that the principal can use on the function. For  example,
          lambda:InvokeFunction or lambda:GetFunction .

       --principal (string)
          The  Amazon  Web  Services service or account that invokes the func-
          tion. If you specify a service, use SourceArn  or  SourceAccount  to
          limit who can invoke the function through that service.

       --source-arn (string)
          For Amazon Web Services services, the ARN of the Amazon Web Services
          resource that invokes the function. For example, an Amazon S3 bucket
          or Amazon SNS topic.

          Note  that  Lambda  configures  the  comparison using the StringLike
          operator.

       --source-account (string)
          For Amazon S3, the ID of the account that  owns  the  resource.  Use
          this together with SourceArn to ensure that the resource is owned by
          the specified account. It is possible for an Amazon S3 bucket to  be
          deleted by its owner and recreated by another account.

       --event-source-token (string)
          For Alexa Smart Home functions, a token that must be supplied by the
          invoker.

       --qualifier (string)
          Specify a version or alias to add permissions to a published version
          of the function.

       --revision-id (string)
          Only  update  the  policy  if  the revision ID matches the ID that's
          specified. Use this option to avoid  modifying  a  policy  that  has
          changed since you last read it.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To add permissions to an existing Lambda function

       The following add-permission example grants the Amazon SNS service per-
       mission to invoke a function named my-function.

          aws lambda add-permission \
              --function-name my-function \
              --action lambda:InvokeFunction \
              --statement-id sns \
              --principal sns.amazonaws.com

       Output:

          {
              "Statement":
              {
                  "Sid":"sns",
                  "Effect":"Allow",
                  "Principal":{
                      "Service":"sns.amazonaws.com"
                  },
                  "Action":"lambda:InvokeFunction",
                  "Resource":"arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:123456789012:function:my-function"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       Statement -> (string)
          The permission statement that's added to the function policy.
