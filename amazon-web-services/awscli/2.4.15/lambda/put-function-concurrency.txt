PUT-FUNCTION-CONCURRENCY()                          PUT-FUNCTION-CONCURRENCY()



NAME
       put-function-concurrency -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets  the maximum number of simultaneous executions for a function, and
       reserves capacity for that concurrency level.

       Concurrency settings apply to the function as a  whole,  including  all
       published  versions  and the unpublished version. Reserving concurrency
       both ensures that your function has capacity to process  the  specified
       number  of  events  simultaneously, and prevents it from scaling beyond
       that level. Use  GetFunction to see the current setting for a function.

       Use  GetAccountSettings to see your Regional concurrency limit. You can
       reserve concurrency for as many functions as you like, as long  as  you
       leave  at  least  100  simultaneous executions unreserved for functions
       that aren't configured with a per-function limit. For more information,
       see Managing Concurrency .

SYNOPSIS
            put-function-concurrency
          --function-name <value>
          --reserved-concurrent-executions <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --function-name (string)
          The name of the Lambda function.
              Name formats

          o Function name - my-function .

          o Function    ARN    -   arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:func-
            tion:my-function .

          o Partial ARN - 123456789012:function:my-function .

          The length constraint applies only to the full ARN. If  you  specify
          only the function name, it is limited to 64 characters in length.

       --reserved-concurrent-executions (integer)
          The number of simultaneous executions to reserve for the function.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To configure a reserved concurrency limit for a function

       The  following put-function-concurrency example configures 100 reserved
       concurrent executions for the my-function function.

          aws lambda put-function-concurrency \
              --function-name  my-function  \
              --reserved-concurrent-executions 100

       Output:

          {
              "ReservedConcurrentExecutions": 100
          }

       For more information, see Reserving Concurrency for a  Lambda  Function
       in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       ReservedConcurrentExecutions -> (integer)
          The number of concurrent executions that are reserved for this func-
          tion. For more information, see Managing Concurrency .
