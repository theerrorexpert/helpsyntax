DELETE-FUNCTION()                                            DELETE-FUNCTION()



NAME
       delete-function -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  Lambda function. To delete a specific function version, use
       the Qualifier  parameter.  Otherwise,  all  versions  and  aliases  are
       deleted.

       To  delete  Lambda  event  source  mappings that invoke a function, use
       DeleteEventSourceMapping  .  For  Amazon  Web  Services  services   and
       resources that invoke your function directly, delete the trigger in the
       service where you originally configured it.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-function
          --function-name <value>
          [--qualifier <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --function-name (string)
          The name of the Lambda function or version.
              Name formats

          o Function name - my-function (name-only), my-function:1 (with  ver-
            sion).

          o Function    ARN    -   arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:func-
            tion:my-function .

          o Partial ARN - 123456789012:function:my-function .

          You can append a version number or alias to any of the formats.  The
          length  constraint applies only to the full ARN. If you specify only
          the function name, it is limited to 64 characters in length.

       --qualifier (string)
          Specify a version to delete. You can't delete a version that's  ref-
          erenced by an alias.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a Lambda function

       The following delete-function example deletes the Lambda function named
       my-function.

          aws lambda delete-function \
              --function-name my-function

       This command produces no output.

       For more information, see AWS Lambda Function Configuration in the  AWS
       Lambda Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
