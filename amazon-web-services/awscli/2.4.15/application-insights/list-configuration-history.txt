NAME
       list-configuration-history -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  INFO,  WARN,  and  ERROR  events for periodic configuration
       updates performed by Application Insights. Examples  of  events  repre-
       sented are:

       o INFO: creating a new alarm or updating an alarm threshold.

       o WARN:  alarm not created due to insufficient data points used to pre-
         dict thresholds.

       o ERROR: alarm not created due to permission errors or  exceeding  quo-
         tas.

SYNOPSIS
            list-configuration-history
          [--resource-group-name <value>]
          [--start-time <value>]
          [--end-time <value>]
          [--event-status <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-group-name (string)
          Resource group to which the application belongs.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The start time of the event.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end time of the event.

       --event-status (string)
          The  status  of  the  configuration  update  event.  Possible values
          include INFO, WARN, and ERROR.

          Possible values:

          o INFO

          o WARN

          o ERROR

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results returned  by  ListConfigurationHistory
          in  paginated  output.  When  this parameter is used, ListConfigura-
          tionHistory returns only MaxResults in a single page  along  with  a
          NextToken  response  element.  The  remaining results of the initial
          request can be  seen  by  sending  another  ListConfigurationHistory
          request  with the returned NextToken value. If this parameter is not
          used, then ListConfigurationHistory returns all results.

       --next-token (string)
          The NextToken value returned from a previous paginated  ListConfigu-
          rationHistory  request  where  MaxResults  was  used and the results
          exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from  the
          end  of the previous results that returned the NextToken value. This
          value is null when there are no more results to return.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EventList -> (list)
          The list of configuration events and their corresponding details.

          (structure)
              The event information.

              MonitoredResourceARN -> (string)
                 The resource monitored by Application Insights.

              EventStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the configuration update event. Possible values
                 include INFO, WARN, and ERROR.

              EventResourceType -> (string)
                 The resource type that Application Insights attempted to con-
                 figure, for example, CLOUDWATCH_ALARM.

              EventTime -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp of the event.

              EventDetail -> (string)
                 The details of the event in plain text.

              EventResourceName -> (string)
                 The name of the resource Application  Insights  attempted  to
                 configure.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  NextToken value to include in a future ListConfigurationHistory
          request. When the  results  of  a  ListConfigurationHistory  request
          exceed MaxResults , this value can be used to retrieve the next page
          of results. This value is null when there are  no  more  results  to
          return.
