SYNOPSIS
            update-application
          --resource-group-name <value>
          [--ops-center-enabled | --no-ops-center-enabled]
          [--cwe-monitor-enabled | --no-cwe-monitor-enabled]
          [--ops-item-sns-topic-arn <value>]
          [--remove-sns-topic | --no-remove-sns-topic]
          [--auto-config-enabled | --no-auto-config-enabled]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-group-name (string)
          The name of the resource group.

       --ops-center-enabled | --no-ops-center-enabled (boolean)
          When  set to true , creates opsItems for any problems detected on an
          application.

       --cwe-monitor-enabled | --no-cwe-monitor-enabled (boolean)
          Indicates whether Application  Insights  can  listen  to  CloudWatch
          events  for the application resources, such as instance terminated ,
          failed deployment , and others.

       --ops-item-sns-topic-arn (string)
          The SNS topic provided to Application Insights that is associated to
          the created opsItem. Allows you to receive notifications for updates
          to the opsItem.

       --remove-sns-topic | --no-remove-sns-topic (boolean)
          Disassociates the SNS topic from the opsItem  created  for  detected
          problems.

       --auto-config-enabled | --no-auto-config-enabled (boolean)

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
