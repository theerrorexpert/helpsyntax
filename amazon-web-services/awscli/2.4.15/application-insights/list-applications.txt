LIST-APPLICATIONS()                                        LIST-APPLICATIONS()



NAME
       list-applications -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the IDs of the applications that you are monitoring.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-applications
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  results  to  return  in  a single call. To
          retrieve the remaining results, make another call with the  returned
          NextToken value.

       --next-token (string)
          The token to request the next page of results.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ApplicationInfoList -> (list)
          The list of applications.

          (structure)
              Describes the status of the application.

              ResourceGroupName -> (string)
                 The name of the resource group used for the application.

              LifeCycle -> (string)
                 The lifecycle of the application.

              OpsItemSNSTopicArn -> (string)
                 The  SNS topic provided to Application Insights that is asso-
                 ciated to the created opsItems to receive  SNS  notifications
                 for opsItem updates.

              OpsCenterEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  Application Insights will create opsItems
                 for any problem  detected  by  Application  Insights  for  an
                 application.

              CWEMonitorEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  Application Insights can listen to Cloud-
                 Watch events for the application resources, such as  instance
                 terminated , failed deployment , and others.

              Remarks -> (string)
                 The  issues  on the user side that block Application Insights
                 from successfully monitoring an application. Example  remarks
                 include:

                 o Configuring application, detected 1 Errors, 3 Warnings

                 o Configuring application, detected 1 Unconfigured Components

              AutoConfigEnabled -> (boolean)

              DiscoveryType -> (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token used to retrieve the next page of results. This  value  is
          null when there are no more results to return.
