DESCRIPTION

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-problems
          [--resource-group-name <value>]
          [--start-time <value>]
          [--end-time <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--component-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-group-name (string)
          The name of the resource group.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The  time  when  the  problem was detected, in epoch seconds. If you
          don't specify a time frame for the request, problems within the past
          seven days are returned.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The time when the problem ended, in epoch seconds. If not specified,
          problems within the past seven days are returned.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of  results  to  return  in  a  single  call.  To
          retrieve  the remaining results, make another call with the returned
          NextToken value.

       --next-token (string)
          The token to request the next page of results.

       --component-name (string)

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ProblemList -> (list)

          (structure)

              StartTime -> (timestamp)

              SeverityLevel -> (string)
                 A measure of the level of impact of the problem.

              ResourceGroupName -> (string)

              Feedback -> (map)
                 Feedback provided by the user about the problem.

                 key -> (string)

              RecurringCount -> (long)

              LastRecurrenceTime -> (timestamp)

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token  used to retrieve the next page of results. This value is
