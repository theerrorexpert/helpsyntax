SYNOPSIS
            get-recommendation-summaries
          [--account-ids <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-ids (list)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account for which to return recom-
          mendation summaries.

          If your account is the management account of  an  organization,  use
          this  parameter  to specify the member account for which you want to
          return recommendation summaries.

          Only one account ID can be specified per request.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --next-token (string)
          The token to advance to the next page of recommendation summaries.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of recommendation summaries to return with a sin-
          gle request.

          To  retrieve  the  remaining  results, make another request with the
          returned nextToken value.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
