SYNOPSIS
            put-recommendation-preferences
          --resource-type <value>
          [--scope <value>]
          [--enhanced-infrastructure-metrics <value>]
          [--inferred-workload-types <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-type (string)
          The target resource type of the recommendation preference to create.

          The  Ec2Instance  option  encompasses   standalone   instances   and
          instances that are part of Auto Scaling groups. The AutoScalingGroup
          option encompasses only instances that are part of an  Auto  Scaling
          group.

          Possible values:

          o Ec2Instance

          o AutoScalingGroup

          o EbsVolume

          o LambdaFunction

          o NotApplicable

       --scope (structure)
          An  object that describes the scope of the recommendation preference
          to create.

          You can create recommendation preferences at the organization  level
          (for  management  accounts  of an organization only), account level,
          and resource level. For more information,  see  Activating  enhanced
          infrastructure metrics in the Compute Optimizer User Guide .

          NOTE:
              You  cannot  create  recommendation preferences for Auto Scaling
              groups at the organization and account levels.  You  can  create
              recommendation  preferences  for Auto Scaling groups only at the
              resource level by specifying a scope name of ResourceArn  and  a
              scope  value  of  the  Auto  Scaling  group Amazon Resource Name
              (ARN). This will configure the preference for all instances that
              are  part  of  the specified Auto Scaling group. You also cannot
              create recommendation preferences  at  the  resource  level  for
              instances that are part of an Auto Scaling group. You can create
              recommendation preferences at the resource level only for stand-
              alone instances.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the scope.

              The following scopes are possible:

              o Organization  -  Specifies  that the recommendation preference
                applies at the organization level, for all member accounts  of
                an organization.

              o AccountId  -  Specifies  that  the  recommendation  preference
                applies at the account level, for all  resources  of  a  given
                resource type in an account.

              o ResourceArn  -  Specifies  that  the recommendation preference
                applies at the individual resource level.

          value -> (string)
              The value of the scope.

              If you specified the name of the scope as:

              o Organization - The value must be ALL_ACCOUNTS .

              o AccountId - The value must be a 12-digit Amazon  Web  Services
                account ID.

              o ResourceArn - The value must be the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                of an EC2 instance or an Auto Scaling group.

              Only EC2 instance and Auto Scaling group ARNs are currently sup-
              ported.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,value=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "name": "Organization"|"AccountId"|"ResourceArn",
            "value": "string"
          }

       --enhanced-infrastructure-metrics (string)
          The  status  of  the  enhanced infrastructure metrics recommendation
          preference to create or update.

          Specify the Active status to activate  the  preference,  or  specify
          Inactive to deactivate the preference.

          For  more  information,  see  Enhanced infrastructure metrics in the
          Compute Optimizer User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o Active

          o Inactive

       --inferred-workload-types (string)
          The status of the inferred workload types recommendation  preference
          to create or update.

          NOTE:
              The  inferred  workload  type  feature  is active by default. To
              deactivate it, create a recommendation preference.

          Specify the Inactive status to deactivate the  feature,  or  specify
          Active to activate it.

          For  more  information,  see  Inferred workload types in the Compute
          Optimizer User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o Active

          o Inactive

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
