DESCRIPTION
       Returns  existing  recommendation  preferences, such as enhanced infra-
       structure metrics.

       Use the scope parameter to specify which preferences to return. You can
       specify  to  return preferences for an organization, a specific account
       ID, or a specific EC2 instance or Auto Scaling  group  Amazon  Resource
       Name (ARN).

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-recommendation-preferences
          --resource-type <value>
          [--scope <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-type (string)
          The target resource type of the recommendation preference for  which
          to return preferences.

          The   Ec2Instance   option   encompasses  standalone  instances  and
          instances that are part of Auto Scaling groups. The AutoScalingGroup
          option  encompasses  only instances that are part of an Auto Scaling
          group.

          Possible values:

          o Ec2Instance

          o AutoScalingGroup

          o EbsVolume

          o LambdaFunction

          o NotApplicable

       --scope (structure)
          An object that describes the scope of the recommendation  preference
          to return.

          You  can  return  recommendation preferences that are created at the
          organization level  (for  management  accounts  of  an  organization
          only),  account level, and resource level. For more information, see
          Activating enhanced infrastructure metrics in the Compute  Optimizer
          User Guide .

          name -> (string)
              The name of the scope.

              The following scopes are possible:

              o Organization  -  Specifies  that the recommendation preference
                applies at the organization level, for all member accounts  of
                an organization.

              o AccountId  -  Specifies  that  the  recommendation  preference
                applies at the account level, for all  resources  of  a  given
                resource type in an account.

              o ResourceArn  -  Specifies  that  the recommendation preference
                applies at the individual resource level.

          value -> (string)
              The value of the scope.

              If you specified the name of the scope as:

              o Organization - The value must be ALL_ACCOUNTS .

              o AccountId - The value must be a 12-digit Amazon  Web  Services
                account ID.

              o ResourceArn - The value must be the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                of an EC2 instance or an Auto Scaling group.

              Only EC2 instance and Auto Scaling group ARNs are currently sup-
              ported.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,value=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "name": "Organization"|"AccountId"|"ResourceArn",
            "value": "string"
          }

       --next-token (string)
          The token to advance to the next page of recommendation preferences.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of recommendation preferences to  return  with  a
          single request.

          To  retrieve  the  remaining  results, make another request with the
          returned nextToken value.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to advance to the next page of recommendation pref-
          erences.

          This  value  is  null when there are no more pages of recommendation
          preferences to return.

       recommendationPreferencesDetails -> (list)
          An array of objects that describe recommendation preferences.

          (structure)
              Describes a recommendation preference.

              scope -> (structure)
                 An object that describes  the  scope  of  the  recommendation
                 preference.

                 Recommendation preferences can be created at the organization
                 level (for management  accounts  of  an  organization  only),
                 account  level, and resource level. For more information, see
                 Activating enhanced infrastructure  metrics  in  the  Compute

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of the scope.

                     o Organization  - Specifies that the recommendation pref-
                       erence applies at the organization level, for all  mem-
                       ber accounts of an organization.

                     o AccountId  -  Specifies that the recommendation prefer-
                       ence applies at the account level, for all resources of
                       a given resource type in an account.

                     o ResourceArn - Specifies that the recommendation prefer-
                       ence applies at the individual resource level.

                 value -> (string)
                     The value of the scope.

                     If you specified the name of the scope as:

                     o Organization - The value must be ALL_ACCOUNTS .

                     o AccountId - The value must be  a  12-digit  Amazon  Web
                       Services account ID.

                     o ResourceArn  -  The  value  must be the Amazon Resource
                       Name (ARN) of an EC2 instance or an Auto Scaling group.

                     Only  EC2  instance  and Auto Scaling group ARNs are cur-

                 The target resource type of the recommendation preference  to
                 create.

                 The  Ec2Instance  option encompasses standalone instances and
                 instances that are part of Auto Scaling groups. The AutoScal-
                 ingGroup  option  encompasses only instances that are part of
                 an Auto Scaling group.

              enhancedInfrastructureMetrics -> (string)
                 The status of the enhanced infrastructure metrics recommenda-
                 tion preference.

                 A status of Active confirms that the preference is applied in
                 the latest recommendation refresh, and a status  of  Inactive
                 confirms that it's not yet applied to recommendations.

                 For  more information, see Enhanced infrastructure metrics in
                 the Compute Optimizer User Guide .

              inferredWorkloadTypes -> (string)
                 The status of  the  inferred  workload  types  recommendation
                 preference.

                 A status of Active confirms that the preference is applied in
                 the latest recommendation refresh. A status of Inactive  con-
                 firms that it's not yet applied to recommendations.
