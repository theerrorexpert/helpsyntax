          list of volume recommendations.

          (structure)
              Describes  a  filter that returns a more specific list of Amazon
              Elastic Block Store (Amazon  EBS)  volume  recommendations.  Use
              this filter with the  GetEBSVolumeRecommendations action.

              You  can  use  LambdaFunctionRecommendationFilter with the  Get-
              LambdaFunctionRecommendations   action,   JobFilter   with   the
              DescribeRecommendationExportJobs  action,  and  Filter  with the
              GetAutoScalingGroupRecommendations and   GetEC2InstanceRecommen-
              dations actions.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

                 Specify  Finding  to  return  recommendations with a specific
                 finding classification (for example, NotOptimized ).

              values -> (list)
                 The value of the filter.

                 The valid values are Optimized , or NotOptimized .

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "Finding",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --account-ids (list)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account for which to return volume
          recommendations.

          If  your  account  is the management account of an organization, use
          this parameter to specify the member account for which you  want  to
          return volume recommendations.

          Only one account ID can be specified per request.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                        (CLI), and SDKs return utilization metrics using  only
                        the  Maximum  statistic,  which  is  the highest value
                        observed during the specified period.

                        The Compute Optimizer console displays graphs for some
                        utilization metrics using the Average statistic, which
                        is the value of Sum / SampleCount during the specified
                        period.  For  more  information,  see Viewing resource
                        recommendations in the Compute Optimizer User Guide  .

                        The performance  risk  of  the  volume  recommendation
                        option.

                        Performance  risk is the likelihood of the recommended
                        volume type meeting  the  performance  requirement  of
                        your workload.

                        The  value ranges from 0 - 4 , with 0 meaning that the
                        recommended resource is predicted  to  always  provide
                        enough hardware capability. The higher the performance
                        risk is, the more likely you should  validate  whether
                        the  recommendation will meet the performance require-
                        ments of your workload before migrating your resource.

                        the EBS volume recommendation option. Savings opportu-
                        nity includes the estimated monthly savings amount and
                        percentage.

                        savingsOpportunityPercentage -> (double)
                            The estimated monthly savings possible as  a  per-
                            centage  of monthly cost by adopting Compute Opti-
                            mizer recommendations for a given resource.

                        estimatedMonthlySavings -> (structure)
                            An object that  describes  the  estimated  monthly
                            savings   amount   possible,  based  on  On-Demand
                            instance pricing, by  adopting  Compute  Optimizer
                            recommendations for a given resource.

                            currency -> (string)
                               The  currency of the estimated monthly savings.

                               The value of the estimated monthly savings.

              lastRefreshTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp of when the volume recommendation was last gen-
                 erated.

              currentPerformanceRisk -> (string)
                 The  risk  of  the current EBS volume not meeting the perfor-
                 mance needs of its workloads. The higher the risk,  the  more
                 likely  the current EBS volume doesn't have sufficient capac-
                 ity.

       errors -> (list)
          An array of objects that describe errors of the request.

          For example, an error is returned if you request recommendations for
          an unsupported volume.

          (structure)
              Describes an error experienced when getting recommendations.

              For example, an error is returned if you request recommendations
              for an unsupported Auto Scaling group, or if you request  recom-
              mendations for an instance of an unsupported instance family.

              identifier -> (string)
                 The ID of the error.

              code -> (string)
