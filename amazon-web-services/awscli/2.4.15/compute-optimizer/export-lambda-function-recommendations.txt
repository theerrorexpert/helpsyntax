EXPORT-LAMBDA-FUNCTION-RECOMMENDATIONSEXPORT-LAMBDA-FUNCTION-RECOMMENDATIONS()



NAME
       export-lambda-function-recommendations -

DESCRIPTION
       Exports optimization recommendations for Lambda functions.

       Recommendations  are  exported in a comma-separated values (.csv) file,
       and its metadata in a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)  (.json)  file,
       to  an  existing  Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket that
       you specify. For more information, see Exporting Recommendations in the
       Compute Optimizer User Guide .

       You can have only one Lambda function export job in progress per Amazon
       Web Services Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --account-ids (list)
          The IDs of the Amazon Web Services  accounts  for  which  to  export
          Lambda function recommendations.

          If  your  account  is the management account of an organization, use
          this parameter to specify the member account for which you  want  to
          export recommendations.

          This  parameter cannot be specified together with the include member
          accounts parameter. The parameters are mutually exclusive.

          Recommendations for member accounts are not included in  the  export
          if  this  parameter,  or  the  include member accounts parameter, is
          omitted.

          You can specify multiple account IDs per request.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          An array of objects to specify a filter that exports a more specific
          set of Lambda function recommendations.

          (structure)
              Describes  a  filter that returns a more specific list of Lambda
              function recommendations. Use this filter with  the   GetLambda-
              FunctionRecommendations action.

              You  can  use  EBSFilter  with  the  GetEBSVolumeRecommendations
              action,  JobFilter  with  the   DescribeRecommendationExportJobs
              action,  and Filter with the  GetAutoScalingGroupRecommendations
              and  GetEC2InstanceRecommendations actions.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

                 Specify Finding to return  recommendations  with  a  specific
                 finding classification (for example, NotOptimized ).

                 Specify  FindingReasonCode  to  return recommendations with a
                 specific finding reason code (for example,  MemoryUnderprovi-
                 sioned ).

              values -> (list)
                 The value of the filter.

                 The valid values for this parameter are as follows, depending
                 on what you specify for the name parameter:

                 o Specify Optimized , NotOptimized , or  Unavailable  if  you
                   specify the name parameter as Finding .

                 o Specify  MemoryOverprovisioned  ,  MemoryUnderprovisioned ,
                   InsufficientData , or Inconclusive if you specify the  name
                   parameter as FindingReasonCode .

       --s3-destination-config (structure)
          Describes  the destination Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
          bucket name and key prefix for a recommendations export job.

          You must create the destination Amazon S3 bucket for your  recommen-
          dations  export  before you create the export job. Compute Optimizer
          does not create the S3 bucket for  you.  After  you  create  the  S3
          bucket,  ensure  that it has the required permission policy to allow
          Compute Optimizer to write the export file to it.  If  you  plan  to
          specify  an  object  prefix when you create the export job, you must
          include the object prefix in the policy  that  you  add  to  the  S3
          bucket.  For  more information, see Amazon S3 Bucket Policy for Com-
          pute Optimizer in the Compute Optimizer User Guide .

          bucket -> (string)
              The name of the Amazon S3 bucket to use as the  destination  for
              an export job.

          keyPrefix -> (string)
              The Amazon S3 bucket prefix for an export job.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          bucket=string,keyPrefix=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "bucket": "string",
            "keyPrefix": "string"
          }

       --file-format (string)
          The format of the export file.

          The only export file format currently supported is Csv .

          Possible values:

          o Csv

       --include-member-accounts | --no-include-member-accounts (boolean)
          Indicates  whether  to  include recommendations for resources in all
          member accounts of the organization if your account is  the  manage-
          ment account of an organization.

          The  member accounts must also be opted in to Compute Optimizer, and
          trusted access for Compute Optimizer must be enabled in the  organi-
          zation account. For more information, see Compute Optimizer and Ama-
          zon Web Services Organizations trusted access in the  Compute  Opti-
          mizer User Guide .

          Recommendations  for  member  accounts  of  the organization are not
          included in the export file if this parameter is omitted.

          This parameter cannot be specified together  with  the  account  IDs
          parameter. The parameters are mutually exclusive.

          Recommendations  for  member accounts are not included in the export
          if this parameter, or the account IDs parameter, is omitted.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       jobId -> (string)
          The identification number of the export job.

          Use the  DescribeRecommendationExportJobs action,  and  specify  the
          job ID to view the status of an export job.

       s3Destination -> (structure)
          Describes  the destination Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
          bucket name and object keys of a recommendations  export  file,  and
          its associated metadata file.

          bucket -> (string)
              The  name  of the Amazon S3 bucket used as the destination of an
              export file.

          key -> (string)
              The Amazon S3 bucket key of an export file.

              The key uniquely identifies the object, or export file,  in  the
              S3 bucket.

          metadataKey -> (string)
              The Amazon S3 bucket key of a metadata file.

              The key uniquely identifies the object, or metadata file, in the
              S3 bucket.
