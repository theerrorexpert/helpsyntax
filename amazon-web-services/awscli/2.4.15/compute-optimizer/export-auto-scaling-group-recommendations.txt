EXPORT-AUTO-SCALING-GROUP-RECOMMENDEXPORT-AUTO-SCALING-GROUP-RECOMMENDATIONS()



NAME
       export-auto-scaling-group-recommendations -

DESCRIPTION
       Exports optimization recommendations for Auto Scaling groups.

       Recommendations  are  exported in a comma-separated values (.csv) file,
       and its metadata in a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)  (.json)  file,
       to  an  existing  Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket that
       you specify. For more information, see Exporting Recommendations in the
       Compute Optimizer User Guide .

       You  can  have  only  one Auto Scaling group export job in progress per
       Amazon Web Services Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --account-ids (list)
          The IDs of the Amazon Web Services accounts for which to export Auto
          Scaling group recommendations.

          If  your  account  is the management account of an organization, use
          this parameter to specify the member account for which you  want  to
          export recommendations.

          This  parameter cannot be specified together with the include member
          accounts parameter. The parameters are mutually exclusive.

          Recommendations for member accounts are not included in  the  export
          if  this  parameter,  or  the  include member accounts parameter, is
          omitted.

          You can specify multiple account IDs per request.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          An array of objects to specify a filter that exports a more specific
          set of Auto Scaling group recommendations.

          (structure)
              Describes  a  filter that returns a more specific list of recom-
              mendations. Use this filter with the   GetAutoScalingGroupRecom-
              mendations and  GetEC2InstanceRecommendations actions.

              You  can  use  EBSFilter  with  the  GetEBSVolumeRecommendations
              action, LambdaFunctionRecommendationFilter with the   GetLambda-
              FunctionRecommendations   action,   and   JobFilter   with   the
              DescribeRecommendationExportJobs action.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

                 Specify Finding to return  recommendations  with  a  specific
                 finding classification (for example, Underprovisioned ).

                 Specify RecommendationSourceType to return recommendations of
                 a specific resource type (for example, Ec2Instance ).

                 Specify FindingReasonCodes to return recommendations  with  a
                 specific  finding  reason  code  (for example, CPUUnderprovi-
                 sioned ).

              values -> (list)
                 The value of the filter.

                 The valid values for this parameter are as follows, depending
                 on  what  you specify for the name parameter and the resource
                 type that you wish to filter results for:

                 o Specify Optimized or NotOptimized if you specify  the  name
                   parameter  as  Finding  and  you want to filter results for
                   Auto Scaling groups.

                 o Specify Underprovisioned , Overprovisioned ,  or  Optimized
                   if  you  specify the name parameter as Finding and you want
                   to filter results for EC2 instances.

                 o Specify Ec2Instance or AutoScalingGroup if you specify  the
                   name parameter as RecommendationSourceType .

                 o Specify  one  of  the  following options if you specify the
                   name parameter as FindingReasonCodes :

       --s3-destination-config (structure)
          An object to specify the destination Amazon Simple  Storage  Service
          (Amazon S3) bucket name and key prefix for the export job.

          You  must create the destination Amazon S3 bucket for your recommen-
          dations export before you create the export job.  Compute  Optimizer
          does  not  create  the  S3  bucket  for you. After you create the S3
          bucket, ensure that it has the required permissions policy to  allow
          Compute  Optimizer  to  write  the export file to it. If you plan to
          specify an object prefix when you create the export  job,  you  must
          include  the  object  prefix  in  the  policy that you add to the S3
          bucket. For more information, see Amazon S3 Bucket Policy  for  Com-
          pute Optimizer in the Compute Optimizer User Guide .

          bucket -> (string)
              The  name  of the Amazon S3 bucket to use as the destination for
              an export job.

          keyPrefix -> (string)
              The Amazon S3 bucket prefix for an export job.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          bucket=string,keyPrefix=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "bucket": "string",
            "keyPrefix": "string"
          }

       --file-format (string)
          The format of the export file.

          The only export file format currently supported is Csv .

          Possible values:

          o Csv

       --include-member-accounts | --no-include-member-accounts (boolean)
          Indicates whether to include recommendations for  resources  in  all
          member  accounts  of the organization if your account is the manage-
          ment account of an organization.

          The member accounts must also be opted in to Compute Optimizer,  and
          trusted  access for Compute Optimizer must be enabled in the organi-
          zation account. For more information, see Compute Optimizer and Ama-
          zon  Web  Services Organizations trusted access in the Compute Opti-
          mizer User Guide .

          Recommendations for member accounts  of  the  organization  are  not
          included in the export file if this parameter is omitted.

          This  parameter  cannot  be  specified together with the account IDs
          parameter. The parameters are mutually exclusive.

          Recommendations for member accounts are not included in  the  export
          if this parameter, or the account IDs parameter, is omitted.

       --recommendation-preferences (structure)
          An object to specify the preferences for the Auto Scaling group rec-
          ommendations to export.

          cpuVendorArchitectures -> (list)
              Specifies  the  CPU  vendor  and  architecture  for  Amazon  EC2
              instance and Auto Scaling group recommendations.

              For example, when you specify AWS_ARM64 with:

              o A  GetEC2InstanceRecommendations or  GetAutoScalingGroupRecom-
                mendations request, Compute Optimizer returns  recommendations
                that consist of Graviton2 instance types only.

              o A  GetEC2RecommendationProjectedMetrics request, Compute Opti-
                mizer returns  projected  utilization  metrics  for  Graviton2
                instance type recommendations only.

              o A    ExportEC2InstanceRecommendations  or   ExportAutoScaling-
                GroupRecommendations request, Compute Optimizer exports recom-
                mendations that consist of Graviton2 instance types only.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "cpuVendorArchitectures": ["AWS_ARM64"|"CURRENT", ...]
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       jobId -> (string)
          The identification number of the export job.

          Use  the   DescribeRecommendationExportJobs  action, and specify the
          job ID to view the status of an export job.

       s3Destination -> (structure)
          An object that describes the destination Amazon S3 bucket of a  rec-
          ommendations export file.

          bucket -> (string)
              The  name  of the Amazon S3 bucket used as the destination of an
              export file.

          key -> (string)
              The Amazon S3 bucket key of an export file.

              The key uniquely identifies the object, or export file,  in  the
              S3 bucket.

          metadataKey -> (string)
              The Amazon S3 bucket key of a metadata file.

              The key uniquely identifies the object, or metadata file, in the
              S3 bucket.
