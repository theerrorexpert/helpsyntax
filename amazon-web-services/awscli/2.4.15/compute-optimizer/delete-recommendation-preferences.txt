SYNOPSIS
            delete-recommendation-preferences
          --resource-type <value>
          [--scope <value>]
          --recommendation-preference-names <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-type (string)
          The target resource type of the recommendation preference to delete.

          The  Ec2Instance  option  encompasses   standalone   instances   and
          instances that are part of Auto Scaling groups. The AutoScalingGroup
          option encompasses only instances that are part of an  Auto  Scaling
          group.

          Possible values:

          o Ec2Instance

          o AutoScalingGroup

          o EbsVolume

          o LambdaFunction

          o NotApplicable

       --scope (structure)
          An  object that describes the scope of the recommendation preference
          to delete.

          You can delete recommendation preferences that are  created  at  the
          organization  level  (for  management  accounts  of  an organization
          only), account level, and resource level. For more information,  see
          Activating  enhanced infrastructure metrics in the Compute Optimizer
          User Guide .

          name -> (string)
              The name of the scope.

              The following scopes are possible:

              o Organization - Specifies that  the  recommendation  preference
                applies  at the organization level, for all member accounts of
                an organization.

              o AccountId  -  Specifies  that  the  recommendation  preference
                applies  at  the  account  level, for all resources of a given
                resource type in an account.

              o ResourceArn - Specifies  that  the  recommendation  preference
                applies at the individual resource level.

          value -> (string)
              The value of the scope.

              If you specified the name of the scope as:

              o Organization - The value must be ALL_ACCOUNTS .

              o AccountId  -  The value must be a 12-digit Amazon Web Services
                account ID.

              o ResourceArn - The value must be the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                of an EC2 instance or an Auto Scaling group.

              Only EC2 instance and Auto Scaling group ARNs are currently sup-
              ported.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,value=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "name": "Organization"|"AccountId"|"ResourceArn",
            "value": "string"
          }

       --recommendation-preference-names (list)
          The name of the recommendation preference to delete.

          Enhanced infrastructure metrics (EnhancedInfrastructureMetrics )  is
          the  only  feature that can be activated through preferences. There-
          fore, it is also the only  recommendation  preference  that  can  be
          deleted.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            EnhancedInfrastructureMetrics
            InferredWorkloadTypes

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
