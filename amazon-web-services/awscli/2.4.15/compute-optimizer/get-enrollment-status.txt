GET-ENROLLMENT-STATUS()                                GET-ENROLLMENT-STATUS()



NAME
       get-enrollment-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  enrollment  (opt  in) status of an account to the Compute
       Optimizer service.

       If the account is the  management  account  of  an  organization,  this
       action  also  confirms  the enrollment status of member accounts of the
       organization. Use the  GetEnrollmentStatusesForOrganization  action  to
       get detailed information about the enrollment status of member accounts
       of an organization.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-enrollment-status
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       status -> (string)
          The enrollment status of the account.

       statusReason -> (string)
          The reason for the enrollment status of the account.

          For example, an account might show a status of Pending because  mem-
          ber  accounts of an organization require more time to be enrolled in
          the service.

       memberAccountsEnrolled -> (boolean)
          Confirms the enrollment status of member accounts of  the  organiza-
          tion, if the account is a management account of an organization.

       lastUpdatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
          The Unix epoch timestamp, in seconds, of when the account enrollment
          status was last updated.

       numberOfMemberAccountsOptedIn -> (integer)
          The count of organization member accounts that are opted in  to  the
          service, if your account is an organization management account.
