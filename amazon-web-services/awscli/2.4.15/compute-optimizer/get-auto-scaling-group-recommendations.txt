                mizer returns  projected  utilization  metrics  for  Graviton2
                instance type recommendations only.

              o A    ExportEC2InstanceRecommendations  or   ExportAutoScaling-
                GroupRecommendations request, Compute Optimizer exports recom-
                mendations that consist of Graviton2 instance types only.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          cpuVendorArchitectures=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT

                   NotOptimized  **  An  Auto  Scaling group is considered not
                   optimized when Compute Optimizer identifies  a  recommenda-
                   tion that can provide better performance for your workload.

                 o
                   **
                   Optimized ** An Auto Scaling group is considered  optimized
                   when  Compute  Optimizer  determines that the group is cor-
                   rectly provisioned to run your workload based on the chosen
                   instance  type.  For optimized resources, Compute Optimizer
                   might recommend a new generation instance type.

              utilizationMetrics -> (list)
                 An array of objects that describe the utilization metrics  of
                 the Auto Scaling group.

                     Amazon EC2 instance.

                     Compare the utilization  metric  data  of  your  resource
                     against  its  projected utilization metric data to deter-
                     mine the  performance  difference  between  your  current
                     resource and the recommended option.

                        The name of the utilization metric.

                        The following utilization metrics are available:

                        o Cpu  - The percentage of allocated EC2 compute units
                          that are currently in use on the instance. This met-
                          ric  identifies the processing power required to run
                          an application on the  instance.  Depending  on  the
                          instance  type,  tools  in your operating system can
                          show a lower percentage  than  CloudWatch  when  the
                          instance  is  not  allocated  a full processor core.
                          Units: Percent

                        o Memory - The percentage of memory that is  currently
                          in  use  on the instance. This metric identifies the
                          amount of memory required to run an  application  on
                          the instance. Units: Percent

                        NOTE:
                            The  Memory  metric is returned only for resources
                            that have the unified CloudWatch  agent  installed
                            on them. For more information, see Enabling Memory
                            Utilization with the CloudWatch Agent .

                          tions  from all EBS volumes attached to the instance
                          in a specified period of time. Unit: Count

                        o EBS_WRITE_OPS_PER_SECOND - The completed write oper-
                          ations  to  all EBS volumes attached to the instance

                          EBS  volumes attached to the instance in a specified
                          period of time. Unit: Bytes

                        o EBS_WRITE_BYTES_PER_SECOND - The  bytes  written  to
                          all EBS volumes attached to the instance in a speci-
                          fied period of time. Unit: Bytes

                        o DISK_READ_OPS_PER_SECOND - The completed read opera-
                          tions  from  all instance store volumes available to
                          the instance in a specified period of time. If there
                          are no instance store volumes, either the value is 0
                          or the metric is not reported.

                        o DISK_WRITE_OPS_PER_SECOND  -  The  completed   write
                          operations from all instance store volumes available
                          to the instance in a specified period  of  time.  If

                               for your resources using Amazon CloudWatch. For
                               more  information,  see  the  Amazon CloudWatch

                            value -> (double)
                               The value of the utilization metric.

                     performanceRisk -> (double)
                        The performance risk of the Auto Scaling group config-
                        uration recommendation.

                        Performance  risk indicates the likelihood of the rec-
                        ommended instance type not meeting the resource  needs
                        of  your  workload.  Compute  Optimizer  calculates an
                        individual performance risk score for each  specifica-
                        tion  of the recommended instance, including CPU, mem-
                        ory, EBS throughput, EBS IOPS, disk  throughput,  disk
                        IOPS, network throughput, and network PPS. The perfor-
                        mance risk of the recommended instance  is  calculated
                        as  the maximum performance risk score across the ana-
                        lyzed resource specifications.

                        The value ranges from 0 - 4 , with 0 meaning that  the
                        recommended  resource  is  predicted to always provide
                        enough hardware capability. The higher the performance
                        risk  is,  the more likely you should validate whether
                        the recommendation will meet the performance  require-
                        ments of your workload before migrating your resource.

                     rank -> (integer)
                        The rank of  the  Auto  Scaling  group  recommendation
                        option.

                        The top recommendation option is ranked as 1 .

                     savingsOpportunity -> (structure)
                        An  object  that describes the savings opportunity for
                        the Auto Scaling group recommendation option.  Savings
                        opportunity  includes  the  estimated  monthly savings
                        amount and percentage.

                        savingsOpportunityPercentage -> (double)
                            The estimated monthly savings possible as  a  per-
                            centage  of monthly cost by adopting Compute Opti-
                            mizer recommendations for a given resource.

                        estimatedMonthlySavings -> (structure)
                            An object that  describes  the  estimated  monthly
                            savings   amount   possible,  based  on  On-Demand
                            instance pricing, by  adopting  Compute  Optimizer
                            recommendations for a given resource.

                            currency -> (string)
                               The  currency of the estimated monthly savings.

                            value -> (double)
                               The value of the estimated monthly savings.

                     migrationEffort -> (string)
                        The level of effort required to migrate from the  cur-
                        rent instance type to the recommended instance type.

                        For example, the migration effort is Low if Amazon EMR
                        is the inferred workload type and an Amazon  Web  Ser-
                        vices  Graviton  instance  type  is  recommended.  The
                        migration effort is Medium if a workload type couldn't
                        be  inferred  but  an  Amazon  Web  Services  Graviton
                        instance type is recommended. The migration effort  is
                        VeryLow  if  both the current and recommended instance
                        types are of the same CPU architecture.

              lastRefreshTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp of when the Auto Scaling  group  recommendation
                 was last generated.

              currentPerformanceRisk -> (string)
                 The  risk  of  the current Auto Scaling group not meeting the
                 performance needs of its workloads. The higher the risk,  the
                 more  likely the current Auto Scaling group configuration has
                 insufficient capacity and cannot meet workload  requirements.

              effectiveRecommendationPreferences -> (structure)
                 An object that describes the effective recommendation prefer-
                 ences for the Auto Scaling group.

                 cpuVendorArchitectures -> (list)
                     Describes the CPU vendor and architecture for an instance
                     or Auto Scaling group recommendations.

                     For example, when you specify AWS_ARM64 with:

                     o A   GetEC2InstanceRecommendations  or   GetAutoScaling-
                       GroupRecommendations request, Compute Optimizer returns
                       recommendations  that  consist  of  Graviton2  instance
                       types only.

                     o A  GetEC2RecommendationProjectedMetrics  request,  Com-
                       pute  Optimizer  returns  projected utilization metrics
                       for Graviton2 instance type recommendations only.

                     o A  ExportEC2InstanceRecommendations or  ExportAutoScal-
                       ingGroupRecommendations   request,   Compute  Optimizer
                       exports  recommendations  that  consist  of   Graviton2
                       instance types only.

                     (string)

                 enhancedInfrastructureMetrics -> (string)
                     Describes  the  activation  status of the enhanced infra-
                     structure metrics preference.

                     A status  of  Active  confirms  that  the  preference  is
                     applied  in the latest recommendation refresh, and a sta-
                     tus of Inactive confirms that it's  not  yet  applied  to
                     recommendations.

                     For more information, see Enhanced infrastructure metrics
                     in the Compute Optimizer User Guide .

                 inferredWorkloadTypes -> (string)
                     Describes the activation status of the inferred  workload
                     types preference.

                     A  status  of  Active  confirms  that  the  preference is
                     applied in the latest recommendation refresh. A status of
                     Inactive  confirms that it's not yet applied to recommen-
                     dations.

              inferredWorkloadTypes -> (list)
                 The applications that might be running on  the  instances  in
                 the Auto Scaling group as inferred by Compute Optimizer.

                 Compute  Optimizer can infer if one of the following applica-
                 tions might be running on the instances:

                 o AmazonEmr - Infers that Amazon EMR might be running on  the
                   instances.

                 o ApacheCassandra  -  Infers  that  Apache Cassandra might be
                   running on the instances.

                   instances.

                 o Redis  -  Infers  that  Redis  might  be  running  on   the
                   instances.

                 (string)

       errors -> (list)
          An array of objects that describe errors of the request.

          For example, an error is returned if you request recommendations for
          an unsupported Auto Scaling group.

          (structure)
              Describes an error experienced when getting recommendations.

              For example, an error is returned if you request recommendations
              for  an unsupported Auto Scaling group, or if you request recom-
              mendations for an instance of an unsupported instance family.
