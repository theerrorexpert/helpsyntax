       --filters (list)
          An array of objects to specify a filter that returns a more specific
          list of instance recommendations.

          (structure)
              Describes a filter that returns a more specific list  of  recom-
              mendations.  Use this filter with the  GetAutoScalingGroupRecom-
              mendations and  GetEC2InstanceRecommendations actions.

              You can  use  EBSFilter  with  the   GetEBSVolumeRecommendations
              action,  LambdaFunctionRecommendationFilter with the  GetLambda-
              FunctionRecommendations   action,   and   JobFilter   with   the
              DescribeRecommendationExportJobs action.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

                 Specify  Finding  to  return  recommendations with a specific
                 finding classification (for example, Underprovisioned ).

                 Specify RecommendationSourceType to return recommendations of
                 a specific resource type (for example, Ec2Instance ).

                 Specify  FindingReasonCodes  to return recommendations with a
                 specific finding reason  code  (for  example,  CPUUnderprovi-
                 sioned ).

              values -> (list)
                 The value of the filter.

                mizer  returns  projected  utilization  metrics  for Graviton2
                instance type recommendations only.

              o A   ExportEC2InstanceRecommendations  or    ExportAutoScaling-
                GroupRecommendations request, Compute Optimizer exports recom-
                mendations that consist of Graviton2 instance types only.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          cpuVendorArchitectures=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                   sioned  when  at  least one specification of your instance,
                   such as CPU, memory, or network, does not meet the  perfor-
                   mance  requirements  of  your  workload.  Under-provisioned
                   instances may lead to poor application performance.

                   still  meeting  the  performance requirements of your work-
                   load, and no specification is under-provisioned.  Over-pro-
                   visioned  instances  may lead to unnecessary infrastructure

                   network, meet the performance requirements of your workload
                   and  is not over provisioned. For optimized resources, Com-
                   pute Optimizer might recommend a  new  generation  instance
                   type.

              findingReasonCodes -> (list)
                 The reason for the finding classification of the instance.

                        lyzed resource specifications.

                        The value ranges from 0 - 4 , with 0 meaning that  the
                        recommended  resource  is  predicted to always provide
                        enough hardware capability. The higher the performance
                        risk  is,  the more likely you should validate whether
                        the recommendation will meet the performance  require-
                        ments of your workload before migrating your resource.

                     rank -> (integer)
                        The rank of the instance recommendation option.

                        The top recommendation option is ranked as 1 .

                     savingsOpportunity -> (structure)
                        An object that describes the savings  opportunity  for
                        the  instance  recommendation option. Savings opportu-
                        nity includes the estimated monthly savings amount and
                        percentage.

                        savingsOpportunityPercentage -> (double)
                            The  estimated  monthly savings possible as a per-
                            centage of monthly cost by adopting Compute  Opti-
                            mizer recommendations for a given resource.

                        estimatedMonthlySavings -> (structure)
                            An  object  that  describes  the estimated monthly
                            savings  amount  possible,  based   on   On-Demand
                            instance  pricing,  by  adopting Compute Optimizer
                            recommendations for a given resource.

                            currency -> (string)
                               The currency of the estimated monthly  savings.

                            value -> (double)
                               The value of the estimated monthly savings.

                     migrationEffort -> (string)
                        The  level of effort required to migrate from the cur-
                        rent instance type to the recommended instance type.

                        For example, the migration effort is Low if Amazon EMR
                        is  the  inferred workload type and an Amazon Web Ser-
                        vices  Graviton  instance  type  is  recommended.  The
                        migration effort is Medium if a workload type couldn't
                        be  inferred  but  an  Amazon  Web  Services  Graviton
                        instance  type is recommended. The migration effort is
                        VeryLow if both the current and  recommended  instance
                        types are of the same CPU architecture.

                 The  risk of the current instance not meeting the performance
                 needs of its workloads. The higher the risk, the more  likely
                 the current instance cannot meet the performance requirements
                 of its workload.

              effectiveRecommendationPreferences -> (structure)

                     or Auto Scaling group recommendations.

                     For example, when you specify AWS_ARM64 with:

                     o A   GetEC2InstanceRecommendations  or   GetAutoScaling-
                       GroupRecommendations request, Compute Optimizer returns
                       recommendations  that  consist  of  Graviton2  instance
                       types only.

                     o A   GetEC2RecommendationProjectedMetrics  request, Com-
                       pute Optimizer returns  projected  utilization  metrics
                       for Graviton2 instance type recommendations only.

                     o A  ExportEC2InstanceRecommendations or  ExportAutoScal-
                       ingGroupRecommendations  request,   Compute   Optimizer
                       exports   recommendations  that  consist  of  Graviton2
                       instance types only.

                     Describes the activation status of  the  enhanced  infra-
                     structure metrics preference.

                     A  status  of  Active  confirms  that  the  preference is
                     applied in the latest recommendation refresh, and a  sta-
                     tus  of  Inactive  confirms  that it's not yet applied to
                     recommendations.

                     For more information, see Enhanced infrastructure metrics
                     in the Compute Optimizer User Guide .

                     applied in the latest recommendation refresh. A status of
                     Inactive confirms that it's not yet applied to  recommen-
                     dations.

              inferredWorkloadTypes -> (list)
                 The  applications  that  might  be running on the instance as
                 inferred by Compute Optimizer.
