NAME
       get-ec2-recommendation-projected-metrics -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the projected utilization metrics of Amazon EC2 instance recom-
       mendations.

       NOTE:
          The Cpu and Memory metrics are the only projected  utilization  met-
          rics  returned  when  you  run this action. Additionally, the Memory
          metric is returned only for resources that have the  unified  Cloud-
          Watch  agent  installed  on them. For more information, see Enabling
          Memory Utilization with the CloudWatch Agent .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-ec2-recommendation-projected-metrics
          --instance-arn <value>
          --stat <value>
          --period <value>
          --start-time <value>
          --end-time <value>
          [--recommendation-preferences <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instances for which to  return
          recommendation projected metrics.

       --stat (string)
          The statistic of the projected metrics.

          Possible values:

          o Maximum

          o Average

       --period (integer)
          The granularity, in seconds, of the projected metrics data points.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The timestamp of the first projected metrics data point to return.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The timestamp of the last projected metrics data point to return.

       --recommendation-preferences (structure)
          An  object to specify the preferences for the Amazon EC2 recommenda-
          tion projected metrics to return in the response.

          cpuVendorArchitectures -> (list)
              Specifies  the  CPU  vendor  and  architecture  for  Amazon  EC2
              instance and Auto Scaling group recommendations.

              For example, when you specify AWS_ARM64 with:

              o A  GetEC2InstanceRecommendations or  GetAutoScalingGroupRecom-
                mendations request, Compute Optimizer returns  recommendations
                that consist of Graviton2 instance types only.

              o A  GetEC2RecommendationProjectedMetrics request, Compute Opti-
                mizer returns  projected  utilization  metrics  for  Graviton2
                instance type recommendations only.

              o A    ExportEC2InstanceRecommendations  or   ExportAutoScaling-
                GroupRecommendations request, Compute Optimizer exports recom-
                mendations that consist of Graviton2 instance types only.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          cpuVendorArchitectures=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "cpuVendorArchitectures": ["AWS_ARM64"|"CURRENT", ...]
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       recommendedOptionProjectedMetrics -> (list)
          An array of objects that describes projected metrics.

          (structure)
              Describes  a  projected  utilization  metric of a recommendation
              option.

              NOTE:
                 The Cpu and Memory metrics are the only projected utilization
                 metrics  returned  when you run the  GetEC2RecommendationPro-
                 jectedMetrics action.  Additionally,  the  Memory  metric  is
                 returned  only for resources that have the unified CloudWatch
                 agent installed on them. For more information,  see  Enabling
                 Memory Utilization with the CloudWatch Agent .

              recommendedInstanceType -> (string)
                 The recommended instance type.

              rank -> (integer)
                 The rank of the recommendation option projected metric.

                 The top recommendation option is ranked as 1 .

                 The  projected  metric  rank correlates to the recommendation
                 option rank. For example, the projected metric ranked as 1 is
                 related to the recommendation option that is also ranked as 1
                 in the same response.

              projectedMetrics -> (list)
                 An array of objects that  describe  a  projected  utilization
                 metric.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a projected utilization metric of a recommenda-
                     tion option, such as an Amazon EC2 instance. This  repre-
                     sents  the  projected  utilization  of  a  recommendation
                     option had you used that  resource  during  the  analyzed
                     period.

                     Compare  the  utilization  metric  data  of your resource
                     against its projected utilization metric data  to  deter-
                     mine  the  performance  difference  between  your current
                     resource and the recommended option.

                     NOTE:
                        The Cpu and Memory metrics are the only projected uti-
                        lization metrics returned when you run the  GetEC2Rec-
                        ommendationProjectedMetrics action. Additionally,  the
                        Memory metric is returned only for resources that have
                        the unified CloudWatch agent installed  on  them.  For
                        more information, see Enabling Memory Utilization with
                        the CloudWatch Agent .

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of the projected utilization metric.

                        The  following  projected  utilization   metrics   are
                        returned:

                        o Cpu - The projected percentage of allocated EC2 com-
                          pute units that would be in use on  the  recommenda-
                          tion  option  had  you used that resource during the
                          analyzed period. This metric identifies the process-
                          ing power required to run an application on the rec-
                          ommendation option. Depending on the instance  type,
                          tools in your operating system can show a lower per-
                          centage than CloudWatch when  the  instance  is  not
                          allocated a full processor core. Units: Percent

                        o Memory  -  The percentage of memory that would be in
                          use on the recommendation option had you  used  that
                          resource  during  the  analyzed  period. This metric
                          identifies the amount of memory required to  run  an
                          application  on  the  recommendation  option. Units:
                          Percent

                        NOTE:
                            The Memory metric is returned only  for  resources
                            that  have  the unified CloudWatch agent installed
                            on them. For more information, see Enabling Memory
                            Utilization with the CloudWatch Agent .

                     timestamps -> (list)
                        The timestamps of the projected utilization metric.

                        (timestamp)

                     values -> (list)
                        The values of the projected utilization metrics.

                        (double)
