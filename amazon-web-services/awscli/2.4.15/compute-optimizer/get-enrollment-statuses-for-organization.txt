SYNOPSIS
            get-enrollment-statuses-for-organization
          [--filters <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          An array of objects to specify a filter that returns a more specific
          list of account enrollment statuses.

          (structure)
              Describes  a filter that returns a more specific list of account
              enrollment statuses. Use this filter with the  GetEnrollmentSta-
              tusesForOrganization action.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

                 Specify  Status to return accounts with a specific enrollment
                 status (for example, Active ).

              values -> (list)
                 The value of the filter.

                 The valid values are Active , Inactive , Pending , and Failed
                 .

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "Status",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --next-token (string)
          The  token  to  advance  to the next page of account enrollment sta-
          tuses.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of account enrollment statuses to return  with  a
          single  request.  You  can specify up to 100 statuses to return with
          each request.

          To retrieve the remaining results, make  another  request  with  the
          returned nextToken value.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       accountEnrollmentStatuses -> (list)
          An array of objects that describe the enrollment statuses of organi-
          zation member accounts.

          (structure)
              Describes the enrollment  status  of  an  organization's  member
              accounts in Compute Optimizer.

              accountId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account ID.

              status -> (string)
                 The account enrollment status.

              statusReason -> (string)
                 The reason for the account enrollment status.

                 For  example,  an  account  might  show  a  status of Pending
                 because member accounts of an organization require more  time
                 to be enrolled in the service.

              lastUpdatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The  Unix  epoch  timestamp,  in seconds, of when the account
                 enrollment status was last updated.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to advance to the next page of  account  enrollment
          statuses.

          This  value  is null when there are no more pages of account enroll-
          ment statuses to return.
