VERIFY-DOMAIN-IDENTITY()                              VERIFY-DOMAIN-IDENTITY()



NAME
       verify-domain-identity -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  a domain to the list of identities for your Amazon SES account in
       the current AWS Region and attempts to verify it. For more  information
       about  verifying  domains, see Verifying Email Addresses and Domains in
       the Amazon SES Developer Guide.

       You can execute this operation no more than once per second.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            verify-domain-identity
          --domain <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The domain to be verified.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To verify a domain with Amazon SES

       The following example uses the verify-domain-identity command to verify
       a domain:

          aws ses verify-domain-identity --domain example.com

       Output:

          {
             "VerificationToken": "eoEmxw+YaYhb3h3iVJHuXMJXqeu1q1/wwmvjuEXAMPLE"
          }

       To  complete  domain  verification,  you must add a TXT record with the
       returned verification token to your domain's  DNS  settings.  For  more
       information,  see  Verifying Domains in Amazon SES in the Amazon Simple
       Email Service Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       VerificationToken -> (string)
          A TXT record that you must place in the DNS settings of  the  domain
          to complete domain verification with Amazon SES.

          As Amazon SES searches for the TXT record, the domain's verification
          status is  "Pending".  When  Amazon  SES  detects  the  record,  the
          domain's  verification status changes to "Success". If Amazon SES is
          unable to detect the record within 72 hours, the domain's  verifica-
          tion  status changes to "Failed." In that case, if you still want to
          verify the domain, you must restart the  verification  process  from
          the beginning.
