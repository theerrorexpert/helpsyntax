SEND-RAW-EMAIL()                                              SEND-RAW-EMAIL()



NAME
       send-raw-email -

DESCRIPTION
       Composes an email message and immediately queues it for sending.

       This  operation is more flexible than the SendEmail API operation. When
       you use the SendRawEmail operation, you can specify the headers of  the
       message  as  well as its content. This flexibility is useful, for exam-
       ple, when you want to send a multipart MIME email (such a message  that
       contains both a text and an HTML version). You can also use this opera-
       tion to send messages that include attachments.

       The SendRawEmail operation has the following requirements:

       o You can only send email from verified email addresses or domains . If
         you try to send email from an address that isn't verified, the opera-
         tion results in an "Email address not verified" error.

       o If your account is still in the Amazon SES sandbox  ,  you  can  only
         send  email  to  other  verified  addresses  in  your  account, or to
         addresses that are associated with the Amazon SES mailbox simulator .

       o The maximum message size, including attachments, is 10 MB.

       o Each message has to include at least one recipient address. A recipi-
         ent address includes any address on the To:, CC:, or BCC: lines.

       o If you send a single message to more than one recipient address,  and
         one of the recipient addresses isn't in a valid format (that is, it's
         not in the format UserName@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain ),  Ama-
         zon  SES  rejects the entire message, even if the other addresses are
         valid.

       o Each message can include up to 50 recipient addresses across the To:,
         CC:, or BCC: lines. If you need to send a single message to more than
         50 recipients, you have to split the list of recipient addresses into
         groups of less than 50 recipients, and send separate messages to each
         group.

       o Amazon SES allows you to specify 8-bit Content-Transfer-Encoding  for
         MIME message parts. However, if Amazon SES has to modify the contents
         of your message (for example, if you use open  and  click  tracking),
         8-bit  content  isn't preserved. For this reason, we highly recommend
         that you encode all content that isn't 7-bit ASCII. For more informa-
         tion, see MIME Encoding in the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

       Additionally,  keep the following considerations in mind when using the
       SendRawEmail operation:

       o Although you  can  customize  the  message  headers  when  using  the
         SendRawEmail  operation,  Amazon SES will automatically apply its own
         Message-ID and Date headers; if you passed these headers when  creat-
         ing  the  message, they will be overwritten by the values that Amazon
         SES provides.

       o If you are using sending authorization to send on behalf  of  another
         user,  SendRawEmail enables you to specify the cross-account identity
         for the email's Source, From, and Return-Path parameters  in  one  of
         two  ways:  you  can  pass  optional parameters SourceArn , FromArn ,
         and/or ReturnPathArn to the API, or you  can  include  the  following
         X-headers in the header of your raw email:

         o X-SES-SOURCE-ARN

         o X-SES-FROM-ARN

         o X-SES-RETURN-PATH-ARN

       WARNING:
          Don't  include  these  X-headers  in  the DKIM signature. Amazon SES
          removes these before it sends the email.

       If you only specify the SourceIdentityArn parameter,  Amazon  SES  sets
       the From and Return-Path addresses to the same identity that you speci-
       fied.

       For more information about sending authorization, see the Using Sending
       Authorization with Amazon SES in the Amazon SES Developer Guide.

       o For  every  message  that  you  send,  the total number of recipients
         (including each recipient in the To:, CC: and BCC: fields) is counted
         against the maximum number of emails you can send in a 24-hour period
         (your sending quota ). For more information about sending  quotas  in
         Amazon SES, see Managing Your Amazon SES Sending Limits in the Amazon
         SES Developer Guide.

SYNOPSIS
            send-raw-email
          [--source <value>]
          [--destinations <value>]
          --raw-message <value>
          [--from-arn <value>]
          [--source-arn <value>]
          [--return-path-arn <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--configuration-set-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source (string)
          The identity's email address. If you do not provide a value for this
          parameter,  you must specify a "From" address in the raw text of the
          message. (You can also specify both.)

          NOTE:
              Amazon SES does not support the SMTPUTF8 extension, as described
              in`RFC6531  <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6531>`__  . For this
              reason, the local part of a source email address  (the  part  of
              the  email  address  that  precedes the @ sign) may only contain
              7-bit ASCII characters . If the domain part of an  address  (the
              part  after the @ sign) contains non-ASCII characters, they must
              be encoded using Punycode, as described in RFC3492 . The  sender
              name  (also  known  as the friendly name ) may contain non-ASCII
              characters.  These  characters  must  be  encoded   using   MIME
              encoded-word   syntax,   as   described   in  RFC  2047  .  MIME
              encoded-word syntax uses the  following  form:  =?charset?encod-
              ing?encoded-text?= .

          If  you  specify  the  Source parameter and have feedback forwarding
          enabled, then bounces and complaints will  be  sent  to  this  email
          address.  This takes precedence over any Return-Path header that you
          might include in the raw text of the message.

       --destinations (list)
          A list of destinations for the message, consisting of To:, CC:,  and
          BCC: addresses.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --raw-message (structure)
          The  raw email message itself. The message has to meet the following
          criteria:

          o The message has to contain a header and a  body,  separated  by  a
            blank line.

          o All  of the required header fields must be present in the message.

          o Each part of a multipart MIME message must be formatted  properly.

          o Attachments  must  be  of a content type that Amazon SES supports.
            For a list on unsupported content types, see  Unsupported  Attach-
            ment Types in the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

          o The entire message must be base64-encoded.

          o If  any  of the MIME parts in your message contain content that is
            outside of the 7-bit ASCII character range,  we  highly  recommend
            that  you  encode  that content. For more information, see Sending
            Raw Email in the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

          o Per RFC 5321 , the maximum length of each line of text,  including
            the <CRLF>, must not exceed 1,000 characters.

          Data -> (blob)
              The  raw  data of the message. This data needs to base64-encoded
              if you are accessing  Amazon  SES  directly  through  the  HTTPS
              interface. If you are accessing Amazon SES using an AWS SDK, the
              SDK takes care of the base 64-encoding for you.  In  all  cases,
              the  client  must  ensure  that the message format complies with
              Internet email standards regarding  email  header  fields,  MIME
              types, and MIME encoding.

              The  To:, CC:, and BCC: headers in the raw message can contain a
              group list.

              If you are using SendRawEmail with  sending  authorization,  you
              can  include  X-headers  in  the  raw  message  to  specify  the
              "Source," "From," and "Return-Path" addresses. For more informa-
              tion, see the documentation for SendRawEmail .

              WARNING:
                 Do not include these X-headers in the DKIM signature, because
                 they are removed by Amazon SES before sending the email.

              For more information, go to the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Data=blob

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Data": blob
          }

       --from-arn (string)
          This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN
          of  the  identity  that is associated with the sending authorization
          policy that permits you to specify a particular  "From"  address  in
          the header of the raw email.

          Instead   of   using  this  parameter,  you  can  use  the  X-header
          X-SES-FROM-ARN in the raw message of the email. If you use both  the
          FromArn  parameter  and  the corresponding X-header, Amazon SES uses
          the value of the FromArn parameter.

          NOTE:
              For information about  when  to  use  this  parameter,  see  the
              description of SendRawEmail in this guide, or see the Amazon SES
              Developer Guide .

       --source-arn (string)
          This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN
          of  the  identity  that is associated with the sending authorization
          policy that permits you to send for the email address  specified  in
          the Source parameter.

          For   example,   if   the   owner  of  example.com  (which  has  ARN
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com ) attaches a
          policy  to  it  that  authorizes you to send from user@example.com ,
          then    you    would     specify     the     SourceArn     to     be
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com  ,  and  the
          Source to be user@example.com .

          Instead  of  using  this  parameter,  you  can  use   the   X-header
          X-SES-SOURCE-ARN  in  the  raw message of the email. If you use both
          the SourceArn parameter and the corresponding X-header,  Amazon  SES
          uses the value of the SourceArn parameter.

          NOTE:
              For  information  about  when  to  use  this  parameter, see the
              description of SendRawEmail in this guide, or see the Amazon SES
              Developer Guide .

       --return-path-arn (string)
          This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN
          of the identity that is associated with  the  sending  authorization
          policy  that  permits  you to use the email address specified in the
          ReturnPath parameter.

          For  example,  if  the  owner  of   example.com   (which   has   ARN
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com ) attaches a
          policy to it that authorizes you to use feedback@example.com ,  then
          you      would      specify      the     ReturnPathArn     to     be
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com  ,  and  the
          ReturnPath to be feedback@example.com .

          Instead   of   using  this  parameter,  you  can  use  the  X-header
          X-SES-RETURN-PATH-ARN in the raw message of the email.  If  you  use
          both  the  ReturnPathArn  parameter  and the corresponding X-header,
          Amazon SES uses the value of the ReturnPathArn parameter.

          NOTE:
              For information about  when  to  use  this  parameter,  see  the
              description of SendRawEmail in this guide, or see the Amazon SES
              Developer Guide .

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags, in the form of name/value  pairs,  to  apply  to  an
          email  that you send using SendRawEmail . Tags correspond to charac-
          teristics of the email that you define,  so  that  you  can  publish
          email sending events.

          (structure)
              Contains  the  name  and  value of a tag that you can provide to
              SendEmail or SendRawEmail to apply to an email.

              Message tags, which you use with configuration sets, enable  you
              to  publish  email  sending  events. For information about using
              configuration sets, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the tag. The name must:

                 o This value can only contain ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z),  num-
                   bers (0-9), underscores (_), or dashes (-).

                 o Contain less than 256 characters.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag. The value must:

                 o This  value can only contain ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), num-
                   bers (0-9), underscores (_), or dashes (-).

                 o Contain less than 256 characters.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --configuration-set-name (string)
          The name of the configuration set to use  when  you  send  an  email
          using SendRawEmail .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To send a raw email using Amazon SES

       The  following example uses the send-raw-email command to send an email
       with a TXT attachment:

          aws ses send-raw-email \
          --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \
          --raw-message file://message.json

       Output:

          {
             "MessageId": "EXAMPLEf3f73d99b-c63fb06f-d263-41f8-a0fb-d0dc67d56c07-000000"
          }

       The raw message is a JSON data structure saved in  a  file  named  mes-
       sage.json in the current directory. It contains the following:

          {
             "Data": "From: sender@example.com\nTo: recipient@example.com\nSubject: Test email sent using the AWS CLI (contains an attachment)\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nContent-type: Multipart/Mixed; boundary=\"NextPart\"\n\n--NextPart\nContent-Type: text/plain\n\nThis is the message body.\n\n--NextPart\nContent-Type: text/plain;\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"attachment.txt\"\n\nThis is the text in the attachment.\n\n--NextPart--"
          }

       As  you can see, "Data" is one long string that contains the entire raw
       email content in MIME format, including an  attachment  called  attach-
       ment.txt.

       Replace sender@example.com and recipient@example.com with the addresses
       you want to use. Note that the sender's email address must be  verified
       with Amazon SES. Until you are granted production access to Amazon SES,
       you must also verify the email address  of  the  recipient  unless  the
       recipient  is the Amazon SES mailbox simulator. For more information on
       verification, see Verifying Email Addresses and Domains in  Amazon  SES
       in the Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide.

       The  Message ID in the output indicates that the call to send-raw-email
       was successful.

       If you don't receive the email, check your Junk box.

       For more information on sending raw email, see Sending Raw Email  Using
       the  Amazon SES API in the Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       MessageId -> (string)
          The unique message identifier returned from the SendRawEmail action.
