VERIFY-DOMAIN-DKIM()                                      VERIFY-DOMAIN-DKIM()



NAME
       verify-domain-dkim -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a set of DKIM tokens for a domain identity.

       WARNING:
          When you execute the VerifyDomainDkim operation, the domain that you
          specify is added to the list of identities that are associated  with
          your  account.  This  is true even if you haven't already associated
          the domain with your account by using the VerifyDomainIdentity oper-
          ation.  However,  you  can't  send  email  from the domain until you
          either successfully verify it or you successfully set up DKIM for it
          .

       You use the tokens that are generated by this operation to create CNAME
       records. When Amazon SES detects that you've added these records to the
       DNS  configuration  for a domain, you can start sending email from that
       domain. You can start sending email even if you haven't added  the  TXT
       record  provided  by the VerifyDomainIdentity operation to the DNS con-
       figuration for your domain. All email that you send from the domain  is
       authenticated using DKIM.

       To  create the CNAME records for DKIM authentication, use the following
       values:

       o Name : token ._domainkey.*example.com*

       o Type : CNAME

       o Value : token .dkim.amazonses.com

       In the preceding example, replace token with one of the tokens that are
       generated  when  you  execute  this operation. Replace example.com with
       your domain. Repeat this process for each  token  that's  generated  by
       this operation.

       You can execute this operation no more than once per second.

SYNOPSIS
            verify-domain-dkim
          --domain <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain to be verified for Easy DKIM signing.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To  generate a verified domain's DKIM tokens for DKIM signing with Ama-
       zon SES

       The following example uses the verify-domain-dkim command  to  generate
       DKIM tokens for a domain that has been verified with Amazon SES:

          aws ses verify-domain-dkim --domain example.com

       Output:

          {
             "DkimTokens": [
                 "EXAMPLEq76owjnks3lnluwg65scbemvw",
                 "EXAMPLEi3dnsj67hstzaj673klariwx2",
                 "EXAMPLEwfbtcukvimehexktmdtaz6naj"
             ]
          }

       To  set  up  DKIM, you must use the returned DKIM tokens to update your
       domain's DNS settings with CNAME records that point to DKIM public keys
       hosted by Amazon SES. For more information, see Easy DKIM in Amazon SES
       in the Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       DkimTokens -> (list)
          A set of character strings that represent the domain's identity.  If
          the identity is an email address, the tokens represent the domain of
          that address.

          Using these tokens, you need to create DNS CNAME records that  point
          to  DKIM  public keys that are hosted by Amazon SES. Amazon Web Ser-
          vices eventually detects that you've updated your DNS records.  This
          detection process might take up to 72 hours. After successful detec-
          tion, Amazon SES is able to DKIM-sign email  originating  from  that
          domain.  (This  only applies to domain identities, not email address
          identities.)

          For more information about creating DNS records using  DKIM  tokens,
          see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .
