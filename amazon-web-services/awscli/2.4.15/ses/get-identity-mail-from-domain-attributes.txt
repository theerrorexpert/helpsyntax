NAME
       get-identity-mail-from-domain-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the custom MAIL FROM attributes for a list of identities (email
       addresses : domains).

       This operation is throttled at one request per second and can only  get
       custom MAIL FROM attributes for up to 100 identities at a time.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-identity-mail-from-domain-attributes
          --identities <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --identities (list)
          A list of one or more identities.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       MailFromDomainAttributes -> (map)
          A map of identities to custom MAIL FROM attributes.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Represents  the custom MAIL FROM domain attributes of a verified
              identity (email address or domain).

              MailFromDomain -> (string)
                 The custom MAIL FROM domain that the identity  is  configured
                 to use.

              MailFromDomainStatus -> (string)
                 The  state that indicates whether Amazon SES has successfully
                 read the MX record required for custom MAIL FROM domain  set-
                 up.  If  the state is Success , Amazon SES uses the specified
                 custom MAIL FROM domain when the verified identity  sends  an
                 email.  All  other  states indicate that Amazon SES takes the
                 action described by BehaviorOnMXFailure .

              BehaviorOnMXFailure -> (string)
                 The action that Amazon SES takes if  it  cannot  successfully
                 read  the  required MX record when you send an email. A value
                 of UseDefaultValue indicates that if Amazon SES  cannot  read
                 the required MX record, it uses amazonses.com (or a subdomain
                 of that) as the MAIL FROM domain. A  value  of  RejectMessage
                 indicates  that  if  Amazon  SES  cannot read the required MX
                 record, Amazon SES returns a MailFromDomainNotVerified  error
                 and does not send the email.

                 The  custom MAIL FROM setup states that result in this behav-
                 ior are Pending , Failed , and TemporaryFailure .
