SEND-BULK-TEMPLATED-EMAIL()                        SEND-BULK-TEMPLATED-EMAIL()



NAME
       send-bulk-templated-email -

DESCRIPTION
       Composes an email message to multiple destinations. The message body is
       created using an email template.

       In order to send email using the SendBulkTemplatedEmail operation, your
       call to the API must meet the following requirements:

       o The  call  must  refer  to an existing email template. You can create
         email templates using the  CreateTemplate operation.

       o The message must be sent from a verified email address or domain.

       o If your account is still in the Amazon SES sandbox, you may only send
         to  verified  addresses  or domains, or to email addresses associated
         with the Amazon SES Mailbox  Simulator.  For  more  information,  see
         Verifying  Email  Addresses  and  Domains in the Amazon SES Developer
         Guide.

       o The maximum message size is 10 MB.

       o Each Destination parameter must include at least one recipient  email
         address.  The  recipient address can be a To: address, a CC: address,
         or a BCC: address. If a recipient email address is invalid (that  is,
         it is not in the format UserName@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain ),
         the entire message will be rejected, even  if  the  message  contains
         other recipients that are valid.

       o The  message may not include more than 50 recipients, across the To:,
         CC: and BCC: fields. If you need to send an email message to a larger
         audience,  you  can  divide  your recipient list into groups of 50 or
         fewer, and then call  the  SendBulkTemplatedEmail  operation  several
         times to send the message to each group.

       o The  number  of  destinations you can contact in a single call to the
         API may be limited by your account's maximum sending rate.

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source (string)
          The email address that is sending the email. This email address must
          be  either  individually  verified with Amazon SES, or from a domain
          that has been verified with Amazon SES. For information about  veri-
          fying identities, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

          If you are sending on behalf of another user and have been permitted
          to do so by a sending authorization policy, then you must also spec-
          ify  the  SourceArn  parameter.  For  more information about sending
          authorization, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              Amazon SES does not support the SMTPUTF8 extension, as described
              in  RFC6531  . For this reason, the local part of a source email
              address (the part of the email address that precedes the @ sign)
              may  only contain 7-bit ASCII characters . If the domain part of
              an address (the part after the @ sign) contains non-ASCII  char-
              acters,  they  must  be  encoded using Punycode, as described in
              RFC3492 . The sender name (also known as the friendly name ) may
              contain  non-ASCII  characters. These characters must be encoded
              using MIME encoded-word syntax, as described in RFC 2047 .  MIME
              encoded-word  syntax  uses  the following form: =?charset?encod-
              ing?encoded-text?= .

       --source-arn (string)
          This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN
          of  the  identity  that is associated with the sending authorization
          policy that permits you to send for the email address  specified  in
          the Source parameter.

          For   example,   if   the   owner  of  example.com  (which  has  ARN
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com ) attaches a
          policy  to  it  that  authorizes you to send from user@example.com ,
          then    you    would     specify     the     SourceArn     to     be
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com  ,  and  the
          Source to be user@example.com .

          For more information about sending authorization, see the Amazon SES
          Developer Guide .

       --reply-to-addresses (list)
          The  reply-to  email  address(es)  for the message. If the recipient
          replies to the message,  each  reply-to  address  will  receive  the
          reply.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --return-path (string)
          The  email  address that bounces and complaints will be forwarded to
          when feedback forwarding is enabled. If the message cannot be deliv-
          ered  to  the recipient, then an error message will be returned from
          the recipient's ISP; this message will  then  be  forwarded  to  the
          email  address specified by the ReturnPath parameter. The ReturnPath
          parameter is never overwritten. This email address  must  be  either
          individually  verified  with  Amazon  SES, or from a domain that has
          been verified with Amazon SES.

       --return-path-arn (string)
          This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN
          of  the  identity  that is associated with the sending authorization
          policy that permits you to use the email address  specified  in  the
          ReturnPath parameter.

          For   example,   if   the   owner  of  example.com  (which  has  ARN
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com ) attaches a
          policy  to it that authorizes you to use feedback@example.com , then
          you     would     specify     the      ReturnPathArn      to      be
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com  ,  and  the
          ReturnPath to be feedback@example.com .

          For more information about sending authorization, see the Amazon SES
          Developer Guide .

       --configuration-set-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  configuration  set to use when you send an email
          using SendBulkTemplatedEmail .

       --default-tags (list)
          A list of tags, in the form of name/value  pairs,  to  apply  to  an
          email  that you send to a destination using SendBulkTemplatedEmail .

          (structure)
              Contains the name and value of a tag that  you  can  provide  to
              SendEmail or SendRawEmail to apply to an email.

              Message  tags, which you use with configuration sets, enable you
              to publish email sending events.  For  information  about  using
              configuration sets, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the tag. The name must:

                 o This  value can only contain ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), num-
                   bers (0-9), underscores (_), or dashes (-).

                 o Contain less than 256 characters.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag. The value must:

                 o This value can only contain ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z),  num-
                   bers (0-9), underscores (_), or dashes (-).

                 o Contain less than 256 characters.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --template (string)
          The template to use when sending this email.

       --template-arn (string)
          The ARN of the template to use when sending this email.

       --default-template-data (string)
          A  list of replacement values to apply to the template when replace-
          ment data is not specified in a Destination object. These values act
          as a default or fallback option when no other data is available.

          The  template  data  is  a  JSON  object,  typically  consisting  of
          key-value pairs in which the keys correspond to replacement tags  in
          the email template.

       --destinations (list)
          One or more Destination objects. All of the recipients in a Destina-
          tion will receive the same version of the email. You can specify  up
          to 50 Destination objects within a Destinations array.

          (structure)
              An  array that contains one or more Destinations, as well as the
              tags and replacement data associated with each of those Destina-
              tions.

              Destination -> (structure)
                 Represents the destination of the message, consisting of To:,
                 CC:, and BCC: fields.

                 NOTE:
                     Amazon SES does not support the  SMTPUTF8  extension,  as
                     described in RFC6531 . For this reason, the local part of
                     a destination  email  address  (the  part  of  the  email
                     address  that precedes the @ sign) may only contain 7-bit
                     ASCII characters . If the domain part of an address  (the
                     part  after  the  @  sign) contains non-ASCII characters,
                     they must be encoded  using  Punycode,  as  described  in
                     RFC3492 .

                 ToAddresses -> (list)
                     The recipients to place on the To: line of the message.

                     (string)

                 CcAddresses -> (list)
                     The recipients to place on the CC: line of the message.

                     (string)

                 BccAddresses -> (list)
                     The  recipients to place on the BCC: line of the message.

                     (string)

              ReplacementTags -> (list)
                 A list of tags, in the form of name/value pairs, to apply  to
                 an  email  that  you send using SendBulkTemplatedEmail . Tags
                 correspond to characteristics of the email that  you  define,
                 so that you can publish email sending events.

                 (structure)
                     Contains the name and value of a tag that you can provide
                     to SendEmail or SendRawEmail to apply to an email.

                     Message tags, which  you  use  with  configuration  sets,
                     enable  you to publish email sending events. For informa-
                     tion about using configuration sets, see the  Amazon  SES
                     Developer Guide .

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the tag. The name must:

                        o This  value  can  only  contain  ASCII letters (a-z,
                          A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscores (_), or dashes (-).

                        o Contain less than 256 characters.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag. The value must:

                        o This  value  can  only  contain  ASCII letters (a-z,
                          A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscores (_), or dashes (-).

                        o Contain less than 256 characters.

              ReplacementTemplateData -> (string)
                 A  list  of replacement values to apply to the template. This
                 parameter is a JSON object, typically consisting of key-value
                 pairs in which the keys correspond to replacement tags in the
                 email template.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Destination={ToAddresses=[string,string],CcAddresses=[string,string],BccAddresses=[string,string]},ReplacementTags=[{Name=string,Value=string},{Name=string,Value=string}],ReplacementTemplateData=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Destination": {
                "ToAddresses": ["string", ...],
                "CcAddresses": ["string", ...],
                "BccAddresses": ["string", ...]
              },
              "ReplacementTags": [
                {
                  "Name": "string",
                  "Value": "string"
                }
                ...
              ],
              "ReplacementTemplateData": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
