CREATE-CONFIGURATION-SET-EVENT-DESCREATE-CONFIGURATION-SET-EVENT-DESTINATION()



NAME
       create-configuration-set-event-destination -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a configuration set event destination.

       NOTE:
          When  you  create  or  update an event destination, you must provide
          one, and only one, destination. The destination can  be  CloudWatch,
          Amazon Kinesis Firehose, or Amazon Simple Notification Service (Ama-
          zon SNS).

       An event destination is the AWS service to which Amazon  SES  publishes
       the  email  sending  events  associated  with  a configuration set. For
       information about using configuration sets, see the Amazon  SES  Devel-
       oper Guide .

       You can execute this operation no more than once per second.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       JSON Syntax:

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
