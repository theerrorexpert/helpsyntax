LIST-RECEIPT-RULE-SETS()                              LIST-RECEIPT-RULE-SETS()



NAME
       list-receipt-rule-sets -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  receipt  rule sets that exist under your AWS account in the
       current AWS Region. If there are additional receipt  rule  sets  to  be
       retrieved,  you  will  receive  a NextToken that you can provide to the
       next call to ListReceiptRuleSets to retrieve the additional entries.

       For information about managing receipt rule sets, see  the  Amazon  SES
       Developer Guide .

       You can execute this operation no more than once per second.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-receipt-rule-sets is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: RuleSets

SYNOPSIS
            list-receipt-rule-sets
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RuleSets -> (list)
          The metadata for the currently active receipt rule set. The metadata
          consists of the rule set name and the timestamp of when the rule set
          was created.

          (structure)
              Information about a receipt rule set.

              A receipt rule set is a collection of rules  that  specify  what
              Amazon  SES  should  do  with mail it receives on behalf of your
              account's verified domains.

              For information about setting up  receipt  rule  sets,  see  the
              Amazon SES Developer Guide .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the receipt rule set. The name must:

                 o This  value can only contain ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), num-
                   bers (0-9), underscores (_), or dashes (-).

                 o Start and end with a letter or number.

                 o Contain less than 64 characters.

              CreatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the receipt rule set was created.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token indicating that  there  are  additional  receipt  rule  sets
          available  to  be  listed.  Pass  this  token to successive calls of
          ListReceiptRuleSets to retrieve up to 100 receipt  rule  sets  at  a
          time.
