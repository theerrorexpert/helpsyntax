SYNOPSIS
            create-receipt-filter
          --filter <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filter (structure)
          A data structure that describes the IP  address  filter  to  create,
          which  consists of a name, an IP address range, and whether to allow
          or block mail from it.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the IP address filter. The name must:

              o This value can only contain ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z),  numbers
                (0-9), underscores (_), or dashes (-).

              o Start and end with a letter or number.

              o Contain less than 64 characters.

          IpFilter -> (structure)
              A  structure  that  provides the IP addresses to block or allow,
              and whether to block or allow incoming mail from them.

              Policy -> (string)
                 Indicates whether to block or allow incoming  mail  from  the
                 specified IP addresses.

              Cidr -> (string)
                 A  single IP address or a range of IP addresses that you want
                 to block or allow, specified in Classless Inter-Domain  Rout-
                 ing  (CIDR) notation. An example of a single email address is
                 10.0.0.1.  An  example  of  a  range  of  IP   addresses   is
                 10.0.0.1/24.  For  more  information about CIDR notation, see
                 RFC 2317 .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,IpFilter={Policy=string,Cidr=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Name": "string",
            "IpFilter": {
              "Policy": "Block"|"Allow",
              "Cidr": "string"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
