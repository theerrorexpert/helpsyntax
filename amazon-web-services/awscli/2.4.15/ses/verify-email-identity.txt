NAME
       verify-email-identity -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  an  email  address  to the list of identities for your Amazon SES
       account in the current AWS region and  attempts  to  verify  it.  As  a
       result of executing this operation, a verification email is sent to the
       specified address.

       You can execute this operation no more than once per second.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            verify-email-identity
          --email-address <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --email-address (string)
          The email address to be verified.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To verify an email address with Amazon SES

       The following example uses the verify-email-identity command to  verify
       an email address:

          aws ses verify-email-identity --email-address user@example.com

       Before  you  can  send  an  email using Amazon SES, you must verify the
       address or domain that you are sending the email from to prove that you
       own it. If you do not have production access yet, you also need to ver-
       ify any email addresses that  you  send  emails  to  except  for  email
       addresses provided by the Amazon SES mailbox simulator.

       After verify-email-identity is called, the email address will receive a
       verification email. The user must click on the link  in  the  email  to
       complete the verification process.

       the Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
