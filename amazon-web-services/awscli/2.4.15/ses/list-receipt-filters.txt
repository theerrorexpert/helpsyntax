NAME
       list-receipt-filters -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  IP  address filters associated with your AWS account in the
       current AWS Region.

       For information about managing IP address filters, see the  Amazon  SES
       Developer Guide .

       You can execute this operation no more than once per second.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-receipt-filters
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Filters -> (list)
          A list of IP address filter data structures, which each consist of a
          name, an IP address range, and whether to allow or block  mail  from
          it.

          (structure)
              A  receipt  IP  address filter enables you to specify whether to
              accept or reject mail originating from an IP address or range of
              IP addresses.

              For  information  about  setting  up IP address filters, see the
              Amazon SES Developer Guide .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the IP address filter. The name must:

                 o This value can only contain ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z),  num-
                   bers (0-9), underscores (_), or dashes (-).

                 o Start and end with a letter or number.

                 o Contain less than 64 characters.

              IpFilter -> (structure)
                 A structure that provides the IP addresses to block or allow,
                 and whether to block or allow incoming mail from them.

                 Policy -> (string)
                     Indicates whether to block or allow  incoming  mail  from
                     the specified IP addresses.

                 Cidr -> (string)
                     A  single  IP address or a range of IP addresses that you
                     want  to  block  or   allow,   specified   in   Classless
                     Inter-Domain  Routing  (CIDR)  notation.  An example of a
                     single email address is 10.0.0.1. An example of  a  range
                     of  IP  addresses  is  10.0.0.1/24.  For more information
                     about CIDR notation, see RFC 2317 .
