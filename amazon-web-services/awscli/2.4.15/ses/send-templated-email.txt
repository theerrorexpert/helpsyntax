SEND-TEMPLATED-EMAIL()                                  SEND-TEMPLATED-EMAIL()



NAME
       send-templated-email -

DESCRIPTION
       Composes  an  email  message  using  an  email template and immediately
       queues it for sending.

       In order to send email using  the  SendTemplatedEmail  operation,  your
       call to the API must meet the following requirements:

       o The  call  must  refer  to an existing email template. You can create
         email templates using the  CreateTemplate operation.

       o The message must be sent from a verified email address or domain.

       o If your account is still in the Amazon SES sandbox, you may only send
         to  verified  addresses  or domains, or to email addresses associated
         with the Amazon SES Mailbox  Simulator.  For  more  information,  see
         Verifying  Email  Addresses  and  Domains in the Amazon SES Developer
         Guide.

       o The maximum message size is 10 MB.

       o Calls to the SendTemplatedEmail operation may only include one Desti-
         nation  parameter.  A  destination  is  a  set of recipients who will
         receive the same version of the email. The Destination parameter  can
         include up to 50 recipients, across the To:, CC: and BCC: fields.

       o The  Destination  parameter must include at least one recipient email
         address. The recipient address can be a To: address, a  CC:  address,
         or  a BCC: address. If a recipient email address is invalid (that is,
         it is not in the format UserName@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain ),
         the  entire  message  will  be rejected, even if the message contains
         other recipients that are valid.

       WARNING:
          If your call to the SendTemplatedEmail operation includes all of the
          required parameters, Amazon SES accepts it and returns a Message ID.
          However, if Amazon SES can't render the email because  the  template
          contains errors, it doesn't send the email. Additionally, because it
          already accepted the message, Amazon SES doesn't  return  a  message
          stating that it was unable to send the email.

          For these reasons, we highly recommend that you set up Amazon SES to
          send you notifications when Rendering Failure events occur. For more
          information, see Sending Personalized Email Using the Amazon SES API
          in the Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide .

          --destination <value>
          [--reply-to-addresses <value>]
          [--return-path <value>]
          [--source-arn <value>]
          [--return-path-arn <value>]

          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source (string)
          The email address that is sending the email. This email address must
          be  either  individually  verified with Amazon SES, or from a domain
          that has been verified with Amazon SES. For information about  veri-
          fying identities, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

          If you are sending on behalf of another user and have been permitted
          to do so by a sending authorization policy, then you must also spec-
          ify  the  SourceArn  parameter.  For  more information about sending
          authorization, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              Amazon SES does not support the SMTPUTF8 extension, as described
              in  RFC6531  . For this reason, the local part of a source email
              address (the part of the email address that precedes the @ sign)
              may  only contain 7-bit ASCII characters . If the domain part of
              an address (the part after the @ sign) contains non-ASCII  char-
              acters,  they  must  be  encoded using Punycode, as described in
              RFC3492 . The sender name (also known as the friendly name ) may
              contain  non-ASCII  characters. These characters must be encoded
              using MIME encoded-word syntax,  as  described  in`RFC  2047  <-
              https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2047>`__ . MIME encoded-word syn-
              tax uses the following form: =?charset?encoding?encoded-text?= .

       --destination (structure)
          The  destination  for  this  email,  composed  of To:, CC:, and BCC:
          fields. A Destination can include up to 50 recipients  across  these
          three fields.

          ToAddresses -> (list)
              The recipients to place on the To: line of the message.

              (string)

          CcAddresses -> (list)
              The recipients to place on the CC: line of the message.

              (string)

          BccAddresses -> (list)
              The recipients to place on the BCC: line of the message.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ToAddresses=string,string,CcAddresses=string,string,BccAddresses=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ToAddresses": ["string", ...],
            "CcAddresses": ["string", ...],
            "BccAddresses": ["string", ...]
          }

       --reply-to-addresses (list)
          The  reply-to  email  address(es)  for the message. If the recipient
          replies to the message,  each  reply-to  address  will  receive  the
          reply.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --return-path (string)
          The  email  address that bounces and complaints will be forwarded to
          when feedback forwarding is enabled. If the message cannot be deliv-
          ered  to  the recipient, then an error message will be returned from
          the recipient's ISP; this message will  then  be  forwarded  to  the
          email  address specified by the ReturnPath parameter. The ReturnPath
          parameter is never overwritten. This email address  must  be  either
          individually  verified  with  Amazon  SES, or from a domain that has
          been verified with Amazon SES.

       --source-arn (string)
          This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN
          of  the  identity  that is associated with the sending authorization
          policy that permits you to send for the email address  specified  in
          the Source parameter.

          For   example,   if   the   owner  of  example.com  (which  has  ARN
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com ) attaches a
          policy  to  it  that  authorizes you to send from user@example.com ,
          then    you    would     specify     the     SourceArn     to     be
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com  ,  and  the
          Source to be user@example.com .

          For more information about sending authorization, see the Amazon SES
          Developer Guide .

       --return-path-arn (string)
          This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN
          of the identity that is associated with  the  sending  authorization
          policy  that  permits  you to use the email address specified in the
          ReturnPath parameter.

          For  example,  if  the  owner  of   example.com   (which   has   ARN
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com ) attaches a
          policy to it that authorizes you to use feedback@example.com ,  then
          you      would      specify      the     ReturnPathArn     to     be
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com  ,  and  the
          ReturnPath to be feedback@example.com .

          For more information about sending authorization, see the Amazon SES
          Developer Guide .

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags, in the form of name/value  pairs,  to  apply  to  an
          email  that  you  send using SendTemplatedEmail . Tags correspond to
          characteristics of the email that you define, so that you  can  pub-
          lish email sending events.

          (structure)
              Contains  the  name  and  value of a tag that you can provide to
              SendEmail or SendRawEmail to apply to an email.

              Message tags, which you use with configuration sets, enable  you
              to  publish  email  sending  events. For information about using
              configuration sets, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the tag. The name must:

                 o This value can only contain ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z),  num-
                   bers (0-9), underscores (_), or dashes (-).

                 o Contain less than 256 characters.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag. The value must:

                 o This  value can only contain ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), num-
                   bers (0-9), underscores (_), or dashes (-).

                 o Contain less than 256 characters.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --configuration-set-name (string)
          The name of the configuration set to use  when  you  send  an  email
          using SendTemplatedEmail .

       --template (string)
          The template to use when sending this email.

       --template-arn (string)
          The ARN of the template to use when sending this email.

       --template-data (string)
          A  list of replacement values to apply to the template. This parame-
          ter is a JSON object, typically consisting  of  key-value  pairs  in
          which the keys correspond to replacement tags in the email template.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       MessageId -> (string)
          The unique message identifier returned from  the  SendTemplatedEmail
          action.
