SYNOPSIS
            create-receipt-rule
          --rule-set-name <value>
          [--after <value>]
          --rule <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rule-set-name (string)
          The name of the rule set that the receipt rule will be added to.

       --after (string)
          The name of an existing rule  after  which  the  new  rule  will  be
          placed.  If this parameter is null, the new rule will be inserted at
          the beginning of the rule list.

       --rule (structure)
          A data structure that contains the specified rule's  name,  actions,
          recipients, domains, enabled status, scan status, and TLS policy.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the receipt rule. The name must:

              o This  value can only contain ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers
                (0-9), underscores (_), or dashes (-).

              o Start and end with a letter or number.

              o Contain less than 64 characters.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              If true , the receipt rule is active. The default value is false
              .

          TlsPolicy -> (string)
              Specifies  whether Amazon SES should require that incoming email
              is delivered over a connection encrypted  with  Transport  Layer
              Security (TLS). If this parameter is set to Require , Amazon SES
              will bounce emails that are not received over TLS.  The  default
              is Optional .

          Recipients -> (list)
              The  recipient domains and email addresses that the receipt rule
              applies to. If this field is not specified, this rule will match
              all recipients under all verified domains.

              (string)

          Actions -> (list)
              An  ordered list of actions to perform on messages that match at
              least one of the recipient email addresses or domains  specified
              in the receipt rule.

              (structure)
                 An  action that Amazon SES can take when it receives an email
                 on behalf of one or more email addresses or domains that  you
                 own.  An  instance  of  this data type can represent only one
                 action.

                 For information about  setting  up  receipt  rules,  see  the
                 Amazon SES Developer Guide .

                 S3Action -> (structure)
                     Saves  the  received  message to an Amazon Simple Storage
                     Service (Amazon S3) bucket and, optionally,  publishes  a
                     notification to Amazon SNS.

                     TopicArn -> (string)
                        The  ARN  of  the  Amazon SNS topic to notify when the
                        message is saved to the Amazon S3 bucket.  An  example
                        of      an     Amazon     SNS     topic     ARN     is
                        arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:MyTopic . For  more
                        information  about  Amazon  SNS topics, see the Amazon
                        SNS Developer Guide .

                     BucketName -> (string)
                        The name of the Amazon S3 bucket that  incoming  email
                        will be saved to.

                     ObjectKeyPrefix -> (string)
                        The key prefix of the Amazon S3 bucket. The key prefix
                        is similar to a directory name  that  enables  you  to
                        store  similar  data  under  the  same  directory in a
                        bucket.

                     KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                        The customer master key that Amazon SES should use  to
                        encrypt  your  emails before saving them to the Amazon
                        S3 bucket. You can use the default  master  key  or  a
                        custom master key you created in AWS KMS as follows:

                        o To use the default master key, provide an ARN in the
                          form     of      arn:aws:kms:REGION:ACCOUNT-ID-WITH-
                          OUT-HYPHENS:alias/aws/ses . For example, if your AWS
                          account ID is 123456789012 and you want to  use  the
                          default  master  key in the US West (Oregon) region,
                          the  ARN  of  the  default  master  key   would   be
                          arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:alias/aws/ses   .
                          If you use the default master key, you don't need to
                          perform  any  extra steps to give Amazon SES permis-
                          sion to use the key.

                        o To use a custom master key you created in  AWS  KMS,
                          provide  the  ARN  of the master key and ensure that
                          you add a statement to your  key's  policy  to  give
                          Amazon  SES  permission to use it. For more informa-
                          tion about giving permissions, see  the  Amazon  SES
                          Developer Guide .

                        For  more  information about key policies, see the AWS
                        KMS Developer Guide . If you do not specify  a  master
                        key, Amazon SES will not encrypt your emails.

                        WARNING:
                            Your  mail  is  encrypted  by Amazon SES using the
                            Amazon S3 encryption client  before  the  mail  is
                            submitted  to  Amazon  S3  for  storage. It is not
                            encrypted using Amazon S3 server-side  encryption.
                            This means that you must use the Amazon S3 encryp-
                            tion client to decrypt the email after  retrieving
                            it from Amazon S3, as the service has no access to
                            use your AWS KMS keys for decryption. This encryp-
                            tion  client  is  currently available with the AWS
                            SDK for Java and AWS SDK for Ruby only.  For  more
                            information about client-side encryption using AWS
                            KMS master keys, see the Amazon S3 Developer Guide
                            .

                 BounceAction -> (structure)
                     Rejects the received email by returning a bounce response

                        WARNING:
                            There  is  a  30-second timeout on RequestResponse
                            invocations. You should use  Event  invocation  in
                            most cases. Use RequestResponse only when you want
                            to make a mail flow decision, such as  whether  to
                            stop the receipt rule or the receipt rule set.

                 StopAction -> (structure)

                        SNS  notification. UTF-8 is easier to use, but may not
                        preserve all special characters  when  a  message  was
                        encoded  with a different encoding format. Base64 pre-
                        serves all special characters. The  default  value  is
                        UTF-8.

          ScanEnabled -> (boolean)
              If  true  ,  then messages that this receipt rule applies to are
              scanned for spam and viruses. The default value is false .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
