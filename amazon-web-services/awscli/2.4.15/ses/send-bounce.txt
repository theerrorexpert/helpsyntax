NAME
       send-bounce -

DESCRIPTION
       Generates  and  sends  a  bounce  message to the sender of an email you
       received through Amazon SES. You can only use this API on an  email  up
       to 24 hours after you receive it.

       NOTE:
          You  cannot  use  this API to send generic bounces for mail that was
          not received by Amazon SES.

       For information about receiving  email  through  Amazon  SES,  see  the
       Amazon SES Developer Guide .

       You can execute this operation no more than once per second.

                 behalf bounces.

                 For information about receiving email through Amazon SES, see

            "ReportingMta": "string",
            "ArrivalDate": timestamp,
            "ExtensionFields": [
              {
                "Name": "string",
                "Value": "string"
              }
              ...
            ]

          A  list of recipients of the bounced message, including the informa-
          tion required to create the Delivery Status Notifications (DSNs) for
          the  recipients.  You must specify at least one BouncedRecipientInfo
          in the list.

          (structure)
              Recipient-related information to include in the Delivery  Status
              Notification  (DSN)  when  an  email that Amazon SES receives on
              your behalf bounces.

              For information about receiving email through  Amazon  SES,  see
              the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

              Recipient -> (string)
                 The email address of the recipient of the bounced email.

              RecipientArn -> (string)
                 This  parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is
                 the ARN of the identity that is associated with  the  sending
                 authorization  policy  that  permits you to receive email for
                 the recipient of the  bounced  email.  For  more  information
                 about  sending  authorization,  see  the Amazon SES Developer
                 Guide .

              BounceType -> (string)
                 The reason for the  bounce.  You  must  provide  either  this
                 parameter or RecipientDsnFields .

              RecipientDsnFields -> (structure)
                 Recipient-related DSN fields, most of which would normally be
                 filled in automatically when provided with a BounceType . You
                 must provide either this parameter or BounceType .

                 FinalRecipient -> (string)
                     The  email address that the message was ultimately deliv-
                     ered to. This corresponds to the Final-Recipient  in  the
                     DSN.  If not specified, FinalRecipient will be set to the
                     Recipient specified in  the  BouncedRecipientInfo  struc-
                     ture.  Either  FinalRecipient or the recipient in Bounce-
                     dRecipientInfo  must  be  a  recipient  of  the  original
                     bounced message.

                     NOTE:
                        Do  not  prepend the FinalRecipient email address with
                        rfc 822; , as described in RFC 3798 .

                 Action -> (string)
                     The action performed by the reporting mail transfer agent
                     (MTA)  as  a result of its attempt to deliver the message
                     to the recipient address. This is required by RFC 3464  .

                 RemoteMta -> (string)
                     The  MTA to which the remote MTA attempted to deliver the
                     message,   formatted   as   specified   in    RFC    3464
                     (mta-name-type;  mta-name  ).  This  parameter  typically
                     applies only to propagating synchronous bounces.

                 Status -> (string)
                     The status code that indicates what went wrong.  This  is
                     required by RFC 3464 .

                 DiagnosticCode -> (string)
                     An  extended explanation of what went wrong; this is usu-
                     ally an SMTP response. See RFC 3463 for the correct  for-
                     matting of this parameter.

                 LastAttemptDate -> (timestamp)
                     The  time the final delivery attempt was made, in RFC 822
                     date-time format.

                 ExtensionFields -> (list)
                     Additional X-headers to include in the DSN.

                     (structure)
                        Additional X-headers to include in the Delivery Status
                        Notification  (DSN)  when  an  email  that  Amazon SES
                        receives on your behalf bounces.

                        For information about receiving email  through  Amazon
                        SES, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

                        Name -> (string)
                            The  name  of the header to add. Must be between 1
                            and  50  characters,  inclusive,  and  consist  of
                            alphanumeric (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) characters and dashes

                            2048  characters,  and  must  not  contain newline
                            characters ("r" or "n").

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Recipient": "string",

              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --bounce-sender-arn (string)
          This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN
          of  the  identity  that is associated with the sending authorization
          policy that permits you to use the address in the "From"  header  of
          the  bounce.  For  more information about sending authorization, see
          the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       MessageId -> (string)
          The message ID of the bounce message.
