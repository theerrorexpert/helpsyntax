NAME
       describe-configuration-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the details of the specified configuration set. For information
       about using configuration sets, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

       You can execute this operation no more than once per second.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-configuration-set
          --configuration-set-name <value>
          [--configuration-set-attribute-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --configuration-set-name (string)
          The name of the configuration set to describe.

       --configuration-set-attribute-names (list)
          A list of configuration set attributes to return.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            eventDestinations
            trackingOptions
            deliveryOptions
            reputationOptions

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              NOTE:
                 When you create or update an event destination, you must pro-
                 vide one, and only one, destination. The destination  can  be
                 Amazon  CloudWatch,  Amazon Kinesis Firehose or Amazon Simple
                 Notification Service (Amazon SNS).

              Event destinations are associated with configuration sets, which
              enable you to publish email sending events to Amazon CloudWatch,
              Amazon Kinesis Firehose, or Amazon Simple  Notification  Service
              (Amazon  SNS).  For  information about using configuration sets,

                     more  information about Amazon SNS topics, see the Amazon
                     SNS Developer Guide .

       TrackingOptions -> (structure)
          The name of the custom open and  click  tracking  domain  associated
          with the configuration set.

          CustomRedirectDomain -> (string)
              The custom subdomain that will be used to redirect email recipi-
              ents to the Amazon SES event tracking domain.

       DeliveryOptions -> (structure)
          Specifies whether  messages  that  use  the  configuration  set  are
          required to use Transport Layer Security (TLS).

          TlsPolicy -> (string)
              Specifies  whether  messages  that use the configuration set are
              required to use Transport Layer Security (TLS). If the value  is
              Require , messages are only delivered if a TLS connection can be
              established. If the value is Optional , messages can  be  deliv-
              ered in plain text if a TLS connection can't be established.

       ReputationOptions -> (structure)
          An object that represents the reputation settings for the configura-
          tion set.

          SendingEnabled -> (boolean)
              Describes whether email sending is enabled or disabled  for  the
              configuration  set.  If the value is true , then Amazon SES will
              send emails that use the configuration  set.  If  the  value  is
              false  , Amazon SES will not send emails that use the configura-
              tion set. The default value is true . You can change  this  set-
              ting using  UpdateConfigurationSetSendingEnabled .

          ReputationMetricsEnabled -> (boolean)
              Describes whether or not Amazon SES publishes reputation metrics
              for the configuration set, such as bounce and  complaint  rates,
              to Amazon CloudWatch.

              If  the value is true , reputation metrics are published. If the
              value is false ,  reputation  metrics  are  not  published.  The
              default value is false .

          LastFreshStart -> (timestamp)
              The  date  and time at which the reputation metrics for the con-
              figuration set were last reset. Resetting these metrics is known
              as a fresh start .

              When  you  disable  email  sending for a configuration set using
              UpdateConfigurationSetSendingEnabled and later re-enable it, the
              reputation  metrics  for  the configuration set (but not for the
              entire Amazon SES account) are reset.

              If email sending for the configuration set has never  been  dis-
              abled  and later re-enabled, the value of this attribute is null
              .
