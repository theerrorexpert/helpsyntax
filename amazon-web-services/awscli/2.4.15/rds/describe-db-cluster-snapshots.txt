NAME
       describe-db-cluster-snapshots -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  DB cluster snapshots. This API action sup-
       ports pagination.

       For more information on Amazon Aurora DB clusters, see What  is  Amazon
       Aurora? in the Amazon Aurora User Guide.

       For  more information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see Multi-AZ deployments
       with two readable standby DB instances in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

       NOTE:
          The Multi-AZ DB clusters feature is in preview  and  is  subject  to
          change.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-db-cluster-snapshots  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: DBClusterSnapshots

          [--filters <value>]
          [--include-shared | --no-include-shared]
          [--include-public | --no-include-public]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The ID of the DB cluster to retrieve the list of  DB  cluster  snap-
          shots  for.  This  parameter  can't  be used in conjunction with the
          DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier   parameter.   This   parameter    isn't
          case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match the identifier of an existing DBCluster.

       --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier (string)
          A  specific DB cluster snapshot identifier to describe. This parame-
          ter can't be used in conjunction with the DBClusterIdentifier param-
          eter. This value is stored as a lowercase string.

          Constraints:

          o If  supplied,  must match the identifier of an existing DBCluster-
            Snapshot.

          o If this identifier is for an automated snapshot, the  SnapshotType
            parameter must also be specified.

       --snapshot-type (string)
          The type of DB cluster snapshots to be returned. You can specify one
          of the following values:

          o automated - Return all DB cluster snapshots that have  been  auto-
            matically  taken by Amazon RDS for my Amazon Web Services account.

          o manual - Return all DB cluster snapshots that have been  taken  by
            my Amazon Web Services account.

          o shared  -  Return  all  manual DB cluster snapshots that have been
            shared to my Amazon Web Services account.

          o public - Return all DB cluster snapshots that have been marked  as
            public.

          If  you  don't specify a SnapshotType value, then both automated and
          manual DB cluster snapshots are returned. You can include shared  DB
          cluster  snapshots  with these results by enabling the IncludeShared
          parameter. You can include public DB cluster  snapshots  with  these
          results by enabling the IncludePublic parameter.

          The IncludeShared and IncludePublic parameters don't apply for Snap-
          shotType values of manual or automated . The IncludePublic parameter
          doesn't apply when SnapshotType is set to shared . The IncludeShared
          parameter doesn't apply when SnapshotType is set to public .

       --filters (list)
          A filter  that  specifies  one  or  more  DB  cluster  snapshots  to
          describe.

          Supported filters:

          o db-cluster-id - Accepts DB cluster identifiers and DB cluster Ama-
            zon Resource Names (ARNs).

          o db-cluster-snapshot-id - Accepts DB cluster snapshot  identifiers.

          o snapshot-type - Accepts types of DB cluster snapshots.

          o engine - Accepts names of database engines.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              IDs. The filters supported by a  describe  operation  are  docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One  or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --include-shared | --no-include-shared (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to include shared manual  DB  cluster
          snapshots  from  other Amazon Web Services accounts that this Amazon
          Web Services account has been given permission to copy  or  restore.
          By default, these snapshots are not included.

          You  can give an Amazon Web Services account permission to restore a
          manual DB cluster snapshot from another Amazon Web Services  account
          by the ModifyDBClusterSnapshotAttribute API action.

       --include-public | --no-include-public (boolean)
          A  value  that  indicates whether to include manual DB cluster snap-
          shots that are public and can be copied or restored  by  any  Amazon
          Web  Services  account.  By  default,  the  public snapshots are not
          included.

          You can share a manual DB cluster snapshot as public  by  using  the
          ModifyDBClusterSnapshotAttribute API action.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
