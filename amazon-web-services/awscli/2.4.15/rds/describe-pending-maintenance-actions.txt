DESCRIBE-PENDING-MAINTENANCE-ACTIONS()  DESCRIBE-PENDING-MAINTENANCE-ACTIONS()



NAME
       describe-pending-maintenance-actions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of resources (for example, DB instances) that have at
       least one pending maintenance action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-pending-maintenance-actions is a paginated operation. Multiple
       API  calls  may  be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: PendingMaintenanceActions

SYNOPSIS
            describe-pending-maintenance-actions
          [--resource-identifier <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-identifier (string)
          The ARN of a resource to return pending maintenance actions for.

       --filters (list)
          A  filter  that  specifies  one  or more resources to return pending
          maintenance actions for.

          Supported filters:

          o db-cluster-id - Accepts DB cluster identifiers and DB cluster Ama-
            zon  Resource  Names  (ARNs).  The  results list will only include
            pending maintenance actions for  the  DB  clusters  identified  by
            these ARNs.

          o db-instance-id  -  Accepts DB instance identifiers and DB instance
            ARNs. The results  list  will  only  include  pending  maintenance
            actions for the DB instances identified by these ARNs.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              IDs. The filters supported by a  describe  operation  are  docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One  or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                              "Description": "Upgrade to Aurora PostgreSQL 2.4.2"
                          }
                      ]
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       PendingMaintenanceActions -> (list)
          A list of the pending maintenance actions for the resource.

          (structure)
              Describes the pending maintenance actions for a resource.

              ResourceIdentifier -> (string)
                 The ARN of the resource that has pending maintenance actions.

              PendingMaintenanceActionDetails -> (list)
                 A list that provides details about  the  pending  maintenance
                 actions for the resource.

                 (structure)
                     Provides  information  about a pending maintenance action
                     for a resource.

                     Action -> (string)
                        The type of pending maintenance action that is  avail-
                        able for the resource. Valid actions are system-update
                        , db-upgrade , hardware-maintenance , and  ca-certifi-
                        cate-rotation .

                     AutoAppliedAfterDate -> (timestamp)
                        The  date of the maintenance window when the action is
                        applied. The maintenance  action  is  applied  to  the
                        resource  during  its  first  maintenance window after
                        this date.

                     ForcedApplyDate -> (timestamp)
                        The date when the maintenance action is  automatically
                        applied.

                        On this date, the maintenance action is applied to the
                        resource as soon as possible, regardless of the  main-
                        tenance  window  for  the  resource.  There might be a
                        delay of one or more days from this  date  before  the
                        maintenance action is applied.

                     OptInStatus -> (string)
                        Indicates  the  type  of  opt-in request that has been
                        received for the resource.

                     CurrentApplyDate -> (timestamp)
                        The effective date when the pending maintenance action
                        is  applied  to  the  resource.  This  date takes into
                        account opt-in requests received from  the  ApplyPend-
                        ingMaintenanceAction  API,  the AutoAppliedAfterDate ,
                        and the ForcedApplyDate . This value is  blank  if  an
                        opt-in  request  has not been received and nothing has
                        been specified as AutoAppliedAfterDate or ForcedApply-
                        Date .

                     Description -> (string)
                        A  description providing more detail about the mainte-
                        nance action.

       Marker -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous DescribePending-
          MaintenanceActions  request.  If  this  parameter  is specified, the
          response includes only records beyond the marker, up to a number  of
          records specified by MaxRecords .
