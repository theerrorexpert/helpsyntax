NAME
       start-activity-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  a database activity stream to monitor activity on the database.
       For more information, see  Database  Activity  Streams  in  the  Amazon
       Aurora User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-activity-stream
          --resource-arn <value>
          --mode <value>
          --kms-key-id <value>
          [--apply-immediately | --no-apply-immediately]
          [--engine-native-audit-fields-included | --no-engine-native-audit-fields-included]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the DB cluster, for example,
          arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:12345667890:cluster:das-cluster .

       --mode (string)
          Specifies the mode of the database activity stream. Database  events
          such  as  a  change or access generate an activity stream event. The
          database session can handle these  events  either  synchronously  or
          asynchronously.

          Possible values:

          o sync

          o async

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The  Amazon  Web Services KMS key identifier for encrypting messages
          in the database activity stream. The Amazon  Web  Services  KMS  key
          identifier  is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the
          KMS key.

       --apply-immediately | --no-apply-immediately (boolean)
          Specifies whether or not the database activity stream is to start as
          soon as possible, regardless of the maintenance window for the data-
          base.

       --engine-native-audit-fields-included                                 |
       --no-engine-native-audit-fields-included (boolean)
          Specifies    whether   the   database   activity   stream   includes
          engine-native audit fields. This option only applies to an Oracle DB
          instance. By default, no engine-native audit fields are included.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To start a database activity stream

       The  following  start-activity-stream  example  starts  an asynchronous
       activity stream to monitor an Aurora cluster named my-pg-cluster.

          aws rds start-activity-stream \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --mode async \
              --kms-key-id arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:1234567890123:key/a12c345d-6ef7-890g-h123-456i789jk0l1 \
              --resource-arn arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:1234567890123:cluster:my-pg-cluster \
              --apply-immediately

       Output:

          {
              "KmsKeyId": "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:1234567890123:key/a12c345d-6ef7-890g-h123-456i789jk0l1",
              "KinesisStreamName": "aws-rds-das-cluster-0ABCDEFGHI1JKLM2NOPQ3R4S",
              "Status": "starting",
              "Mode": "async",
              "ApplyImmediately": true
          }

       Amazon Aurora User Guide.

OUTPUT
       KmsKeyId -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Web  Services KMS key identifier for encryption of mes-
          sages in the database activity stream.

       KinesisStreamName -> (string)
          The name of the Amazon Kinesis data stream to be used for the  data-
          base activity stream.

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the database activity stream.

       Mode -> (string)
          The mode of the database activity stream.

       ApplyImmediately -> (boolean)
          Indicates  whether or not the database activity stream will start as
          soon as possible, regardless of the maintenance window for the data-
          base.

       EngineNativeAuditFieldsIncluded -> (boolean)
          Indicates  whether  engine-native  audit  fields are included in the
          database activity stream.
