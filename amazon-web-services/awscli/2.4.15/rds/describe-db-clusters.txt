DESCRIBE-DB-CLUSTERS()                                  DESCRIBE-DB-CLUSTERS()



NAME
       describe-db-clusters -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  Amazon  Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB
       clusters. This API supports pagination.

       For more information on Amazon Aurora DB clusters, see What  is  Amazon
       Aurora? in the Amazon Aurora User Guide.

       For  more information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see Multi-AZ deployments
       with two readable standby DB instances in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

       NOTE:
          The Multi-AZ DB clusters feature is in preview  and  is  subject  to
          change.

       This  operation  can  also  return  information  for  Amazon Neptune DB
       instances and Amazon DocumentDB instances.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-db-clusters is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: DBClusters

SYNOPSIS
            describe-db-clusters
          [--db-cluster-identifier <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--include-shared | --no-include-shared]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The user-supplied DB cluster identifier. If this parameter is speci-
          fied, information from only the specific  DB  cluster  is  returned.
          This parameter isn't case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match an existing DBClusterIdentifier.

       --filters (list)
          A filter that specifies one or more DB clusters to describe.

          Supported filters:

          o clone-group-id - Accepts clone group identifiers. The results list
            will only include information about  the  DB  clusters  associated
            with these clone groups.

          o db-cluster-id - Accepts DB cluster identifiers and DB cluster Ama-
            zon Resource Names (ARNs). The  results  list  will  only  include
            information about the DB clusters identified by these ARNs.

          o domain  - Accepts Active Directory directory IDs. The results list
            will only include information about  the  DB  clusters  associated
            with these domains.

          o engine  - Accepts engine names. The results list will only include
            information about the DB clusters for these engines.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              IDs.  The  filters  supported  by a describe operation are docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are  case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --include-shared | --no-include-shared (boolean)
          Optional   Boolean  parameter  that  specifies  whether  the  output
          includes information about clusters shared  from  other  Amazon  Web
          Services accounts.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       Example 2: To list certain attributes of all DB clusters

       The  following  describe-db-clusters example retrieves only the DBClus-
       terIdentifier, Endpoint, and ReaderEndpoint attributes of all  your  DB
       clusters in the current AWS Region.

          aws rds describe-db-clusters \
              --query 'DBClusters[].{DBClusterIdentifier:DBClusterIdentifier,Endpoint:Endpoint,ReaderEndpoint:ReaderEndpoint}'

       Output:

          [
              {
                  "Endpoint": "cluster-57-2020-05-01-2270.cluster-cnpexample.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
                  "ReaderEndpoint": "cluster-57-2020-05-01-2270.cluster-ro-cnpexample.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
                  "DBClusterIdentifier": "cluster-57-2020-05-01-2270"
              },
              {
                  "Endpoint": "cluster-57-2020-05-01-4615.cluster-cnpexample.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
                  "ReaderEndpoint": "cluster-57-2020-05-01-4615.cluster-ro-cnpexample.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
                  "DBClusterIdentifier": "cluster-57-2020-05-01-4615"
              },
              {
                  "Endpoint": "pg2-cluster.cluster-cnpexample.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
                  "ReaderEndpoint": "pg2-cluster.cluster-ro-cnpexample.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
                  "DBClusterIdentifier": "pg2-cluster"
              },
              ...output omitted...
              }
          ]

       Example 3: To list DB clusters with a specific attribute

       The  following  describe-db-clusters example retrieves only the DBClus-
       terIdentifier and Engine attributes of your DB clusters  that  use  the
       aurora-postgresql DB engine.

          aws rds describe-db-clusters \
              --query 'DBClusters[].{DBClusterIdentifier:DBClusterIdentifier,Engine:Engine} | [?Engine == `aurora-postgresql`]'

       Output:

          [
              {
                  "Engine": "aurora-postgresql",
                  "DBClusterIdentifier": "pg2-cluster"
              }
          ]

       For  more  information,  see  Amazon  Aurora  DB Clusters in the Amazon
       Aurora User Guide.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          A pagination token that can be used in  a  later  DescribeDBClusters
          request.

       DBClusters -> (list)
          Contains a list of DB clusters for the user.

          (structure)
              Contains  the details of an Amazon Aurora DB cluster or Multi-AZ
              DB cluster.

              For an Amazon Aurora DB cluster, this data type  is  used  as  a
              response  element  in the operations CreateDBCluster , DeleteDB-
              Cluster , DescribeDBClusters , FailoverDBCluster , ModifyDBClus-
              ter  ,  PromoteReadReplicaDBCluster  ,  RestoreDBClusterFromS3 ,
              RestoreDBClusterFromSnapshot ,  RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime  ,
              StartDBCluster , and StopDBCluster .

              For  a Multi-AZ DB cluster, this data type is used as a response
              element in the operations CreateDBCluster  ,  DeleteDBCluster  ,
              DescribeDBClusters   ,  FailoverDBCluster  ,  ModifyDBCluster  ,
              RebootDBCluster , RestoreDBClusterFromSnapshot , and  RestoreDB-
              ClusterToPointInTime .

              For  more  information on Amazon Aurora DB clusters, see What is
              Amazon Aurora? in the Amazon Aurora User Guide.

              For more information  on  Multi-AZ  DB  clusters,  see  Multi-AZ
              deployments with two readable standby DB instances in the Amazon
              RDS User Guide.

              NOTE:
                 The Multi-AZ DB clusters feature is in preview and is subject
                 to change.

              AllocatedStorage -> (integer)
                 For all database engines except Amazon Aurora, AllocatedStor-
                 age specifies the allocated storage size in gibibytes  (GiB).
                 For Aurora, AllocatedStorage always returns 1, because Aurora
                 DB cluster storage size isn't fixed,  but  instead  automati-
                 cally adjusts as needed.

              AvailabilityZones -> (list)
                 Provides the list of Availability Zones (AZs) where instances
                 in the DB cluster can be created.

                 (string)

              BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
                 Specifies the number of days for which automatic DB snapshots
                 are retained.

              CharacterSetName -> (string)
                 If present, specifies the name of the character set that this
                 cluster is associated with.

              DatabaseName -> (string)
                 Contains the name of the initial database of this DB  cluster
                 that  was  provided at create time, if one was specified when
                 the DB cluster was created. This same name  is  returned  for
                 the life of the DB cluster.

              DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
                 Contains  a user-supplied DB cluster identifier. This identi-
                 fier is the unique key that identifies a DB cluster.

              DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
                 Specifies the name of the DB cluster parameter group for  the

                 The reader endpoint for the DB cluster. The  reader  endpoint
                 for  a DB cluster load-balances connections across the Aurora
                 Replicas that are available  in  a  DB  cluster.  As  clients
                 request  new  connections to the reader endpoint, Aurora dis-
                 tributes the connection requests among the Aurora Replicas in
                 the DB cluster. This functionality can help balance your read
                 workload across multiple Aurora Replicas in your DB  cluster.

                 If  a  failover  occurs,  and the Aurora Replica that you are
                 connected to is promoted to be  the  primary  instance,  your
                 connection is dropped. To continue sending your read workload
                 to other Aurora Replicas in the cluster, you can then  recon-
                 nect to the reader endpoint.

                     Value -> (string)
                        A  value  is the optional value of the tag. The string
                        value can be from  1  to  256  Unicode  characters  in
                        length  and  can't be prefixed with aws: or rds: . The
                        string can only contain only the set of  Unicode  let-
                        ters,  digits,  white-space,  '_', '.', ':', '/', '=',

              GlobalWriteForwardingStatus -> (string)
                 Specifies  whether  a  secondary  cluster in an Aurora global
                 database has write forwarding enabled, not enabled, or is  in
                 the process of enabling it.

              GlobalWriteForwardingRequested -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether you have requested to enable write forward-
                 ing for a secondary cluster in  an  Aurora  global  database.
                 Because  write  forwarding  takes  time  to enable, check the
                 value of  GlobalWriteForwardingStatus  to  confirm  that  the
                 request  has completed before using the write forwarding fea-
                 ture for this cluster.

              PendingModifiedValues -> (structure)
                 A value that specifies that changes to  the  DB  cluster  are
                 pending. This element is only included when changes are pend-

                     LogTypesToEnable -> (list)
                        Log types that are in the  process  of  being  deacti-
                        vated.  After  they  are  deactivated, these log types
                        aren't exported to CloudWatch Logs.

                        (string)

                     LogTypesToDisable -> (list)
                        Log types that are in the process  of  being  enabled.
                        After  they  are enabled, these log types are exported
                        to CloudWatch Logs.

                        (string)

                 DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
                     The DBClusterIdentifier value for the DB cluster.

                 MasterUserPassword -> (string)
                     The master credentials for the DB cluster.

                 IAMDatabaseAuthenticationEnabled -> (boolean)
                     A value that indicates whether mapping of Amazon Web Ser-
                     vices  Identity  and  Access Management (IAM) accounts to
                     database accounts is enabled.

                 EngineVersion -> (string)
                     The database engine version.

              DBClusterInstanceClass -> (string)
                 The name of the compute and memory capacity class of  the  DB
                 instance.

                 This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

              StorageType -> (string)
                 The storage type associated with the DB cluster.

                 This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

              Iops -> (integer)
                 The Provisioned IOPS (I/O operations per second) value.

                 This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

              PubliclyAccessible -> (boolean)
                 Specifies the accessibility options for the DB instance.

                 When  the DB instance is publicly accessible, its Domain Name
                 System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from
                 within  the  DB  instance's  virtual  private cloud (VPC). It
                 resolves to the public IP address  from  outside  of  the  DB
                 instance's  VPC. Access to the DB instance is ultimately con-
                 trolled by the security group it uses. That public access  is
                 not  permitted  if  the  security  group  assigned  to the DB
                 instance doesn't permit it.

                 When the DB instance isn't  publicly  accessible,  it  is  an
                 internal  DB instance with a DNS name that resolves to a pri-
                 vate IP address.

                 automatically.

                 This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

              MonitoringInterval -> (integer)
                 The  interval, in seconds, between points when Enhanced Moni-
                 toring metrics are collected for the DB cluster.

                 This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

              MonitoringRoleArn -> (string)
                 The ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS  to  send  Enhanced
                 Monitoring metrics to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

              PerformanceInsightsEnabled -> (boolean)
                 True  if  Performance Insights is enabled for the DB cluster,
                 and otherwise false.

                 This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

              PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for encryption  of
                 Performance Insights data.

                 The  Amazon  Web  Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN,
                 key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

                 This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

              PerformanceInsightsRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
                 The amount of time, in days, to retain  Performance  Insights
                 data. Valid values are 7 or 731 (2 years).
