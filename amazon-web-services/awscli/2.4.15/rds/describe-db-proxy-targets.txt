DESCRIBE-DB-PROXY-TARGETS()                        DESCRIBE-DB-PROXY-TARGETS()



NAME
       describe-db-proxy-targets -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about DBProxyTarget objects. This API supports pag-
       ination.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-db-proxy-targets is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: Targets

SYNOPSIS
            describe-db-proxy-targets
          --db-proxy-name <value>
          [--target-group-name <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-proxy-name (string)
          The identifier of the DBProxyTarget to describe.

       --target-group-name (string)
          The identifier of the DBProxyTargetGroup to describe.

       --filters (list)
          This parameter is not currently supported.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              IDs. The filters supported by a  describe  operation  are  docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One  or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Targets -> (list)
          An  arbitrary number of DBProxyTarget objects, containing details of
          the corresponding targets.

          (structure)
              Contains the details for an RDS Proxy target. It  represents  an
              RDS  DB instance or Aurora DB cluster that the proxy can connect
              to. One or more targets are associated with an RDS Proxy  target
              group.

              This   data   type   is  used  as  a  response  element  in  the
              DescribeDBProxyTargets action.

              TargetArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the  RDS  DB  instance  or
                 Aurora DB cluster.

              Endpoint -> (string)
                 The  writer  endpoint  for  the  RDS DB instance or Aurora DB
                 cluster.

              TrackedClusterId -> (string)
                 The DB cluster  identifier  when  the  target  represents  an
                 Aurora DB cluster. This field is blank when the target repre-
                 sents an RDS DB instance.

              RdsResourceId -> (string)
                 The  identifier  representing  the  target.  It  can  be  the
                 instance  identifier  for  an RDS DB instance, or the cluster
                 identifier for an Aurora DB cluster.

              Port -> (integer)
                 The port that the RDS Proxy uses to connect to the target RDS
                 DB instance or Aurora DB cluster.

              Type -> (string)
                 Specifies the kind of database, such as an RDS DB instance or
                 an Aurora DB cluster, that the target represents.

              Role -> (string)
                 A value that indicates whether the target of the proxy can be
                 used for read/write or read-only operations.

              TargetHealth -> (structure)
                 Information about the connection health of the RDS Proxy tar-
                 get.

                 State -> (string)
                     The current state of the connection health lifecycle  for
                     the  RDS Proxy target. The following is a typical lifecy-
                     cle example for the states of an RDS Proxy target:
                        registering > unavailable > available > unavailable  >
                        available

                 Reason -> (string)
                     The  reason for the current health State of the RDS Proxy
                     target.

                 Description -> (string)
                     A description of the health of the RDS Proxy  target.  If
                     the State is AVAILABLE , a description is not included.

       Marker -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter is specified, the response includes  only  records  beyond
          the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .
