DESCRIBE-SOURCE-REGIONS()                            DESCRIBE-SOURCE-REGIONS()



NAME
       describe-source-regions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of the source Amazon Web Services Regions where the cur-
       rent Amazon Web Services Region can create a read replica,  copy  a  DB
       snapshot  from,  or  replicate  automated backups from. This API action
       supports pagination.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-source-regions is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: SourceRegions

SYNOPSIS
            describe-source-regions
          [--region-name <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --region-name (string)
          The source Amazon Web Services Region name. For example, us-east-1 .

          Constraints:

          o Must specify a valid Amazon Web Services Region name.

       --filters (list)
          This parameter isn't currently supported.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              IDs.  The  filters  supported  by a describe operation are docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are  case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe source Regions

       The following describe-source-regions example retrieves  details  about
       all of the source AWS Regions. It also shows that automated backups can
       be replicated only from US West (Oregon) to the destination AWS Region,
       US East (N. Virginia).

          aws rds describe-source-regions \
              --region us-east-1

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter  is  specified,  the response includes only records beyond

       SourceRegions -> (list)
          A list of SourceRegion instances that contains  each  source  Amazon
          Web  Services Region that the current Amazon Web Services Region can
          get a read replica or a DB snapshot from.

          (structure)
              Contains an Amazon Web Services Region name as the result  of  a
              successful call to the DescribeSourceRegions action.

              RegionName -> (string)
                 The name of the source Amazon Web Services Region.

              Endpoint -> (string)
                 The  endpoint  for the source Amazon Web Services Region end-
                 point.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the source Amazon Web Services Region.

              SupportsDBInstanceAutomatedBackupsReplication -> (boolean)
                 Whether the source Amazon Web Services Region supports repli-
                 cating  automated  backups to the current Amazon Web Services
                 Region.
