       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            add-source-identifier-to-subscription
          --subscription-name <value>
          --source-identifier <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subscription-name (string)
          The name of the RDS event notification subscription you want to  add
          a source identifier to.

       --source-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the event source to be added.

          Constraints:

          o If  the source type is a DB instance, a DBInstanceIdentifier value
            must be supplied.

          o If the source type is a DB cluster,  a  DBClusterIdentifier  value
            must be supplied.

          o If the source type is a DB parameter group, a DBParameterGroupName
            value must be supplied.

          o If the source type is a DB security group,  a  DBSecurityGroupName
            value must be supplied.

          o If  the source type is a DB snapshot, a DBSnapshotIdentifier value
            must be supplied.

          o If the source type is a DB cluster snapshot, a DBClusterSnapshotI-
            dentifier value must be supplied.

          o If  the  source  type is an RDS Proxy, a DBProxyName value must be
            supplied.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To add a source identifier to a subscription

       The following add-source-identifier example adds another source identi-
       fier to an existing subscription.

          aws rds add-source-identifier-to-subscription \
              --subscription-name my-instance-events \
              --source-identifier test-instance-repl

       Output:

          {
              "EventSubscription": {
                  "SubscriptionCreationTime": "Tue Jul 31 23:22:01 UTC 2018",
                  "CustSubscriptionId": "my-instance-events",
                  "EventSubscriptionArn": "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:es:my-instance-events",
                  "Enabled": false,
                  "Status": "modifying",
                  "EventCategoriesList": [
                      "backup",
                      "recovery"
                  ],

                      "test-instance",
                      "test-instance-repl"
                  ]
              }

          CustomerAwsId -> (string)

              event notification subscription.

          CustSubscriptionId -> (string)
              The RDS event notification subscription Id.

              The status "no-permission" indicates that RDS no longer has per-
              mission  to  post to the SNS topic. The status "topic-not-exist"
              indicates that the topic was deleted after the subscription  was

          SubscriptionCreationTime -> (string)
              The time the RDS event notification subscription was created.

          SourceType -> (string)
              The source type for the RDS event notification subscription.

          SourceIdsList -> (list)
              A  list  of  source IDs for the RDS event notification subscrip-
              tion.

              A list of event categories for the RDS event  notification  sub-
