MODIFY-GLOBAL-CLUSTER()                                MODIFY-GLOBAL-CLUSTER()



NAME
       modify-global-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Modify  a  setting  for an Amazon Aurora global cluster. You can change
       one or more  database  configuration  parameters  by  specifying  these
       parameters  and  the new values in the request. For more information on
       Amazon Aurora, see What is Amazon Aurora? in  the  Amazon  Aurora  User
       Guide.

       NOTE:
          This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-global-cluster
          [--global-cluster-identifier <value>]
          [--new-global-cluster-identifier <value>]
          [--deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection]
          [--engine-version <value>]
          [--allow-major-version-upgrade | --no-allow-major-version-upgrade]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  DB  cluster  identifier  for the global cluster being modified.
          This parameter isn't case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must match the identifier of an existing global database  cluster.

       --new-global-cluster-identifier (string)
          The new cluster identifier for the global database cluster when mod-
          ifying a global database cluster. This value is stored as  a  lower-
          case string.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens

          o The first character must be a letter

          o Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens

          Example: my-cluster2

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          Indicates  if  the  global  database cluster has deletion protection
          enabled. The global database cluster can't be deleted when  deletion
          protection is enabled.

       --engine-version (string)
          The  version  number  of  the  database  engine to which you want to
          upgrade. Changing this parameter results in an outage. The change is
          applied  during  the next maintenance window unless ApplyImmediately
          is enabled.

          To list all of the available engine versions for aurora  (for  MySQL
          5.6-compatible Aurora), use the following command:
              aws  rds  describe-db-engine-versions  --engine  aurora  --query
              '*[]|[?SupportsGlobalDatabases == `true`].[EngineVersion]'

          To list all of the available engine versions for  aurora-mysql  (for
          MySQL  5.7-compatible and MySQL 8.0-compatible Aurora), use the fol-
          lowing command:
              aws  rds   describe-db-engine-versions   --engine   aurora-mysql
              --query  '*[]|[?SupportsGlobalDatabases  ==  `true`].[EngineVer-
              sion]'

          To list all of the available engine versions for aurora-postgresql ,
          use the following command:
              aws  rds  describe-db-engine-versions --engine aurora-postgresql
              --query  '*[]|[?SupportsGlobalDatabases  ==  `true`].[EngineVer-
              sion]'

       --allow-major-version-upgrade     |    --no-allow-major-version-upgrade
       (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether major version upgrades are allowed.

          Constraints: You must allow major version upgrades when specifying a
          value for the EngineVersion parameter that is a different major ver-
          sion than the DB cluster's current version.

          If you upgrade the major version of a global database,  the  cluster
          and  DB  instance  parameter groups are set to the default parameter
          groups for the new version. Apply any custom parameter groups  after
          completing the upgrade.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To modify a global DB cluster

       The following modify-global-cluster example enables deletion protection
       for an Aurora MySQL-compatible global DB cluster.

          aws rds modify-global-cluster \
              --global-cluster-identifier myglobalcluster \
              --deletion-protection

       Output:

          {
              "GlobalCluster": {
                  "GlobalClusterIdentifier": "myglobalcluster",
                  "GlobalClusterResourceId": "cluster-f0e523bfe07aabb",
