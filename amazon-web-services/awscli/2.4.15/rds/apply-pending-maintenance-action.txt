NAME
       apply-pending-maintenance-action -

DESCRIPTION
       Applies  a  pending maintenance action to a resource (for example, to a
       DB instance).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            apply-pending-maintenance-action
          --resource-identifier <value>
          --apply-action <value>
          --opt-in-type <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-identifier (string)
          The RDS Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource that the  pending
          maintenance  action  applies  to.  For information about creating an
          ARN, see Constructing an RDS Amazon Resource Name (ARN) .

       --apply-action (string)
          The pending maintenance action to apply to this resource.

          Valid values: system-update , db-upgrade  ,  hardware-maintenance  ,
          ca-certificate-rotation

       --opt-in-type (string)
          A  value  that  specifies  the  type of opt-in request, or undoes an
          opt-in request. An opt-in request of type immediate can't be undone.

          Valid values:

          o immediate - Apply the maintenance action immediately.

          o next-maintenance  -  Apply  the maintenance action during the next
            maintenance window for the resource.

          o undo-opt-in  -  Cancel  any   existing   next-maintenance   opt-in
            requests.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To apply pending maintenance actions

       The  following  apply-pending-maintenance-action  example  applies  the
       pending maintenance actions for a DB cluster.

          aws rds apply-pending-maintenance-action \
              --resource-identifier arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:cluster:my-db-cluster \
              --apply-action system-update \
              --opt-in-type immediate

       Output:

          {
              "ResourcePendingMaintenanceActions": {
                  "ResourceIdentifier": "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:cluster:my-db-cluster",
                  "PendingMaintenanceActionDetails": [
                      {
                          "Action": "system-update",
                          "OptInStatus": "immediate",
                          "CurrentApplyDate": "2021-01-23T01:07:36.100Z",
                          "Description": "Upgrade to Aurora PostgreSQL 3.3.2"
                      }
                  ]
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       ResourcePendingMaintenanceActions -> (structure)
          Describes the pending maintenance actions for a resource.

          ResourceIdentifier -> (string)
              The ARN of the resource that has pending maintenance actions.

          PendingMaintenanceActionDetails -> (list)
              A list that  provides  details  about  the  pending  maintenance
              actions for the resource.

              (structure)
                 Provides information about a pending maintenance action for a
                 resource.

                 Action -> (string)
                     The type of pending maintenance action that is  available
                     for  the  resource.  Valid  actions  are  system-update ,
                     db-upgrade  ,  hardware-maintenance  ,  and   ca-certifi-
                     cate-rotation .

                 AutoAppliedAfterDate -> (timestamp)
                     The  date  of  the  maintenance window when the action is
                     applied.  The  maintenance  action  is  applied  to   the
                     resource  during  its first maintenance window after this
                     date.

                 ForcedApplyDate -> (timestamp)
                     The date when the  maintenance  action  is  automatically
                     applied.

                     On  this  date,  the maintenance action is applied to the
                     resource as soon as possible, regardless of  the  mainte-
                     nance  window for the resource. There might be a delay of
                     one or more days from this date  before  the  maintenance
                     action is applied.

                 OptInStatus -> (string)
                     Indicates  the  type  of  opt-in  request  that  has been
                     received for the resource.

                 CurrentApplyDate -> (timestamp)
                     The effective date when the pending maintenance action is
                     applied  to  the  resource.  This date takes into account
                     opt-in requests  received  from  the  ApplyPendingMainte-
                     nanceAction  API,  the  AutoAppliedAfterDate  ,  and  the
                     ForcedApplyDate .  This  value  is  blank  if  an  opt-in
                     request has not been received and nothing has been speci-
                     fied as AutoAppliedAfterDate or ForcedApplyDate .

                 Description -> (string)
                     A description providing more detail about the maintenance
                     action.
