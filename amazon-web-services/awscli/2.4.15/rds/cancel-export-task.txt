CANCEL-EXPORT-TASK()                                      CANCEL-EXPORT-TASK()



NAME
       cancel-export-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Cancels an export task in progress that is exporting a snapshot to Ama-
       zon S3. Any data that has already been written to the S3  bucket  isn't
       removed.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            cancel-export-task
          --export-task-identifier <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --export-task-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the snapshot export task to cancel.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To cancel a snapshot export to Amazon S3

       The  following  cancel-export-task  example  cancels  an export task in
       progress that is exporting a snapshot to Amazon S3.

          aws rds cancel-export-task \
              --export-task-identifier my-s3-export-1

       Output:

          {
              "ExportTaskIdentifier": "my-s3-export-1",
              "SourceArn": "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:snapshot:publisher-final-snapshot",
              "SnapshotTime": "2019-03-24T20:01:09.815Z",
              "S3Bucket": "mybucket",

              "IamRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/service-role/export-snap-S3-role",

OUTPUT
       ExportTaskIdentifier -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the snapshot export task. This ID  isn't  an
          identifier  for  the Amazon S3 bucket where the snapshot is exported
          to.

       SourceArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the snapshot  exported  to  Amazon
          S3.

       ExportOnly -> (list)
          The data exported from the snapshot. Valid values are the following:

          o database - Export all the data from a specified database.

          o database.table  table-name - Export a table of the snapshot.  This
            format  is  valid  only  for  RDS  for MySQL, RDS for MariaDB, and
            Aurora MySQL.

          o database.schema  schema-name - Export a  database  schema  of  the
            snapshot.  This  format  is  valid only for RDS for PostgreSQL and
            Aurora PostgreSQL.

          o database.schema.table  table-name - Export a table of the database
            schema.  This  format  is  valid  only  for RDS for PostgreSQL and
            Aurora PostgreSQL.

          (string)

       SnapshotTime -> (timestamp)
          The time that the snapshot was created.

       TaskStartTime -> (timestamp)
          The time that the snapshot export task started.

       TaskEndTime -> (timestamp)
          The time that the snapshot export task completed.

       S3Bucket -> (string)
          The Amazon S3 bucket that the snapshot is exported to.

       S3Prefix -> (string)
          The Amazon S3 bucket prefix that is the file name and  path  of  the
          exported snapshot.

       IamRoleArn -> (string)
          The  name  of  the  IAM role that is used to write to Amazon S3 when
          exporting a snapshot.

       KmsKeyId -> (string)
          The key identifier of the Amazon Web Services KMS key that  is  used
          to encrypt the snapshot when it's exported to Amazon S3. The KMS key
          identifier is its key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name. The IAM
          role  used  for the snapshot export must have encryption and decryp-
          tion permissions to use this KMS key.

       Status -> (string)
          The progress status of the export task.

       PercentProgress -> (integer)
          The progress of the snapshot export task as a percentage.

          The total amount of data exported, in gigabytes.

       FailureCause -> (string)
          The reason the export failed, if it failed.
