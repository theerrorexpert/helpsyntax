NAME
       create-custom-db-engine-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  custom  DB  engine  version (CEV). A CEV is a binary volume
       snapshot of a database engine and  specific  AMI.  The  only  supported
       engine  is Oracle Database 19c Enterprise Edition with the January 2021
       or later RU/RUR.

       Amazon RDS, which is a  fully  managed  service,  supplies  the  Amazon
       Machine  Image  (AMI)  and  database  software. The Amazon RDS database
       software is preinstalled, so you need only select a DB engine and  ver-
       sion,  and create your database. With Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle, you
       upload your database installation files in Amazon S3.

       When you create a custom engine version, you specify  the  files  in  a
       JSON  document called a CEV manifest. This document describes installa-
       tion .zip files stored in Amazon S3. RDS Custom creates your  CEV  from
       the  installation files that you provided. This service model is called
       Bring Your Own Media (BYOM).

       Creation takes approximately two hours. If creation fails,  RDS  Custom
       issues  RDS-EVENT-0196  with  the  message  Creation  failed for custom
       engine version , and includes details about the failure.  For  example,
       the event prints missing files.

       After  you create the CEV, it is available for use. You can create mul-
       tiple CEVs, and create multiple RDS Custom instances from any CEV.  You
       can also change the status of a CEV to make it available or inactive.

       NOTE:
          The  MediaImport service that imports files from Amazon S3 to create
          CEVs isn't integrated with Amazon Web Services  CloudTrail.  If  you
          turn on data logging for Amazon RDS in CloudTrail, calls to the Cre-
          ateCustomDbEngineVersion event aren't logged. However, you might see
          calls  from  the  API  gateway  that accesses your Amazon S3 bucket.
          These calls originate from the MediaImport service for  the  Create-
          CustomDbEngineVersion event.

       For more information, see Creating a CEV in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          --kms-key-id <value>
          [--description <value>]
          --manifest <value>

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --engine (string)
          The database engine to use for your custom engine version (CEV). The
          only supported value is custom-oracle-ee .

       --engine-version (string)
          The name of your CEV. The name format is 19.*customized_string* `` .
          For example, a valid name is ``19.my_cev1 . This setting is required
          for RDS Custom for Oracle, but optional for Amazon RDS. The combina-
          tion of Engine and EngineVersion is unique per customer per  Region.

       --database-installation-files-s3-bucket-name (string)
          The  name of an Amazon S3 bucket that contains database installation
          files for your CEV. For example, a  valid  bucket  name  is  my-cus-
          tom-installation-files .

       --database-installation-files-s3-prefix (string)
          The  Amazon  S3  directory  that  contains the database installation
          files  for  your  CEV.  For  example,  a  valid   bucket   name   is
          123456789012/cev1  .  If  this setting isn't specified, no prefix is
          assumed.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for an encrypted  CEV.  A
          symmetric  KMS key is required for RDS Custom, but optional for Ama-
          zon RDS.

          If you have an existing symmetric KMS key in your account,  you  can
          use it with RDS Custom. No further action is necessary. If you don't
          already have a  symmetric  KMS  key  in  your  account,  follow  the
          instructions  in  Creating symmetric KMS keys in the Amazon Web Ser-
          vices Key Management Service Developer Guide .

          You can choose the same symmetric key when you create a CEV and a DB
          instance, or choose different keys.

       --description (string)
          An optional description of your CEV.

       --manifest (string)
          The  CEV  manifest,  which  is  a  JSON  document that describes the
          installation .zip files stored in Amazon S3. Specify the  name/value
          pairs  in  a file or a quoted string. RDS Custom applies the patches
          in the order in which they are listed.

          The following JSON fields are valid:
              MediaImportTemplateVersion

          Version of the CEV manifest. The date is in the format YYYY-MM-DD  .
              databaseInstallationFileNames

          Ordered list of installation files for the CEV.
              opatchFileNames

          Ordered list of OPatch installers used for the Oracle DB engine.
              psuRuPatchFileNames

          The PSU and RU patches for this CEV.
              OtherPatchFileNames

          The  patches  that are not in the list of PSU and RU patches. Amazon
          RDS applies these patches after applying the PSU and RU patches.

          For more information, see Creating the CEV manifest  in  the  Amazon
          RDS User Guide .

       --tags (list)
          A  list  of  tags.  For  more  information,  see  Tagging Amazon RDS
          Resources in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

          (structure)
              Metadata assigned to an Amazon  RDS  resource  consisting  of  a
              key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 A  key  is the required name of the tag. The string value can
                 be from 1 to 128 Unicode characters in length  and  can't  be
                 prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain only
                 the set of Unicode letters, digits,  white-space,  '_',  '.',
                 ':',    '/',    '=',    '+',    '-',    '@'    (Java   regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A value is the optional value of the tag.  The  string  value
                 can  be  from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length and can't
                 be prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can  only  contain
                 only  the  set  of Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_',
                 '.',  ':',   '/',   '=',   '+',   '-',   '@'   (Java   regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
