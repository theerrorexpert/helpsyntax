DELETE-DB-INSTANCE-AUTOMATED-BACKUP()    DELETE-DB-INSTANCE-AUTOMATED-BACKUP()



NAME
       delete-db-instance-automated-backup -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  automated  backups using the DbiResourceId value of the source
       DB instance or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the automated backups.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-db-instance-automated-backup
          [--dbi-resource-id <value>]
          [--db-instance-automated-backups-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dbi-resource-id (string)
          The  identifier  for  the source DB instance, which can't be changed
          and which is unique to an Amazon Web Services Region.

       --db-instance-automated-backups-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the automated backups  to  delete,
          for                                                         example,
          arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:auto-backup:ab-L2IJCEXJP7XQ7HOJ4SIEX-
          AMPLE .

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       The  following  delete-db-instance-automated-backup example deletes the
       automated backup with the specified Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

          aws rds delete-db-instance-automated-backup \
