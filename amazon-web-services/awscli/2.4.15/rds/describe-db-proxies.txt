DESCRIBE-DB-PROXIES()                                    DESCRIBE-DB-PROXIES()



NAME
       describe-db-proxies -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about DB proxies.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-db-proxies is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: DBProxies

SYNOPSIS
            describe-db-proxies
          [--db-proxy-name <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-proxy-name (string)
          The name of the DB proxy. If you omit  this  parameter,  the  output
          includes  information  about all DB proxies owned by your Amazon Web
          Services account ID.

       --filters (list)
          This parameter is not currently supported.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              IDs.  The  filters  supported  by a describe operation are docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are  case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DBProxies -> (list)
          A return value representing an  arbitrary  number  of  DBProxy  data
          structures.

          (structure)
              The  data  structure  representing  a  proxy  managed by the RDS
              Proxy.

              This  data  type  is  used  as  a  response   element   in   the
              DescribeDBProxies action.

              DBProxyName -> (string)
                 The  identifier  for  the proxy. This name must be unique for

              Status -> (string)
                 The current status of this proxy. A status of available means
                 the proxy is ready to handle requests. Other values  indicate
                 that  you  must  wait for the proxy to be ready, or take some
                 action to resolve an issue.

              EngineFamily -> (string)
                 The engine family applies to MySQL and  PostgreSQL  for  both
                 RDS and Aurora.

              VpcId -> (string)
                 Provides the VPC ID of the DB proxy.

              VpcSecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                 Provides a list of VPC security groups that the proxy belongs
                 to.

                 (string)

              VpcSubnetIds -> (list)
                 The EC2 subnet IDs for the proxy.

                 (string)

              Auth -> (list)
                 One or more  data  structures  specifying  the  authorization
                 mechanism  to  connect  to  the associated RDS DB instance or
                 Aurora DB cluster.

                 (structure)
                     Returns the details of authentication used by a proxy  to
                     log in as a specific database user.

                     Description -> (string)
                        A  user-specified description about the authentication
                        used by a proxy to log in as a specific database user.

                     UserName -> (string)
                        The  name of the database user to which the proxy con-
                        nects.

                     AuthScheme -> (string)
                        The type of authentication that  the  proxy  uses  for
                        connections from the proxy to the underlying database.

                     SecretArn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) representing the secret
                        that  the  proxy  uses  to  authenticate to the RDS DB
                        instance or  Aurora  DB  cluster.  These  secrets  are
                        stored within Amazon Secrets Manager.

                     IAMAuth -> (string)
                        Whether  to  require  or  disallow Amazon Web Services
                        Identity and Access  Management  (IAM)  authentication
                        for connections to the proxy.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  for the IAM role that the
                 proxy uses to access Amazon Secrets Manager.

              Endpoint -> (string)
                 The endpoint that you can use to connect to the DB proxy. You
                 include  the  endpoint  value  in the connection string for a
                 database client application.

              RequireTLS -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether Transport Layer Security  (TLS)  encryption
                 is required for connections to the proxy.

              IdleClientTimeout -> (integer)
                 The  number  of seconds a connection to the proxy can have no
                 activity before the proxy drops the  client  connection.  The
                 proxy  keeps the underlying database connection open and puts
                 it back into the connection pool for reuse by  later  connec-
                 tion requests.

                 Default: 1800 (30 minutes)

                 Constraints: 1 to 28,800

              DebugLogging -> (boolean)
                 Whether  the  proxy  includes  detailed information about SQL
                 statements in its logs. This information helps you  to  debug
                 issues  involving  SQL behavior or the performance and scala-
                 bility  of  the  proxy  connections.  The  debug  information
                 includes  the  text of SQL statements that you submit through
                 the proxy. Thus, only enable this  setting  when  needed  for
                 debugging,  and only when you have security measures in place
                 to safeguard any sensitive information that  appears  in  the
                 logs.

              CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the proxy was first created.

              UpdatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the proxy was last updated.

       Marker -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter is specified, the response includes  only  records  beyond
          the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .
