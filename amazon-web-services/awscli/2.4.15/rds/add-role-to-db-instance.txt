       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            add-role-to-db-instance
          --db-instance-identifier <value>
          --role-arn <value>
          --feature-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-instance-identifier (string)
          The name of the DB instance to associate the IAM role with.

       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to associate with the
          DB instance, for example arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/AccessRole .

       --feature-name (string)
          The  name of the feature for the DB instance that the IAM role is to
          be associated with. For information about supported  feature  names,
          see  DBEngineVersion .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       instance

       cle DB instance named test-instance.

          aws rds add-role-to-db-instance \
              --db-instance-identifier test-instance \
              --feature-name S3_INTEGRATION \
              --role-arn arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/rds-s3-integration-role

       This command produces no output.
