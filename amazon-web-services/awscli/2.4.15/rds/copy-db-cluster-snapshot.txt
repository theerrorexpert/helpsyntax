COPY-DB-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOT()                          COPY-DB-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       copy-db-cluster-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Copies a snapshot of a DB cluster.

       To copy a DB cluster snapshot from a shared manual DB cluster snapshot,
       SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier must  be  the  Amazon  Resource  Name
       (ARN) of the shared DB cluster snapshot.

       You  can  copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another Amazon Web
       Services Region. In that case, the Amazon Web Services Region where you
       call  the  CopyDBClusterSnapshot  action  is the destination Amazon Web
       Services Region for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied  to.
       To  copy  an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another Amazon Web Ser-
       vices Region, you must provide the following values:

       o KmsKeyId - The Amazon Web Services Key Management System (Amazon  Web
         Services  KMS)  key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the copy
         of the DB cluster snapshot in the  destination  Amazon  Web  Services
         Region.

       o PreSignedUrl  -  A  URL  that  contains  a Signature Version 4 signed
         request for the CopyDBClusterSnapshot action  to  be  called  in  the
         source  Amazon  Web  Services Region where the DB cluster snapshot is
         copied from. The pre-signed URL must be a valid request for the Copy-
         DBClusterSnapshot  API action that can be executed in the source Ama-
         zon Web Services Region that contains the encrypted DB cluster  snap-
         shot  to  be copied. The pre-signed URL request must contain the fol-
         lowing parameter values:

         o KmsKeyId - The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for  the  KMS
           key  to  use  to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the
           destination Amazon Web Services Region. This is the same identifier
           for  both  the  CopyDBClusterSnapshot  action that is called in the
           destination Amazon Web Services Region, and the action contained in
           the pre-signed URL.

         o DestinationRegion - The name of the Amazon Web Services Region that
           the DB cluster snapshot is to be created in.

         o SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier - The DB cluster snapshot identi-
           fier for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. This iden-
           tifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  format  for  the
           source  Amazon Web Services Region. For example, if you are copying
           an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from the us-west-2 Amazon Web Ser-
           vices  Region,  then  your  SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier looks
           like              the              following               example:
           arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster-snapshot:aurora-clus-
           ter1-snapshot-20161115 .

       To learn how to generate a Signature  Version  4  signed  request,  see
       Authenticating  Requests:  Using  Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services
       Signature Version 4) and Signature Version 4 Signing Process .

       NOTE:
          If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can
          specify  SourceRegion  (or  --source-region  for the CLI) instead of
          specifying PreSignedUrl manually. Specifying SourceRegion autogener-
          ates a pre-signed URL that is a valid request for the operation that
          can be executed in the source Amazon Web Services Region.

       o TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier - The identifier for the  new  copy
         of  the  DB  cluster  snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services
         Region.

       o SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier - The DB cluster  snapshot  identi-
         fier for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. This identi-
         fier must be in the ARN format for the  source  Amazon  Web  Services
         Region and is the same value as the SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier
         in the pre-signed URL.

       To cancel the copy operation once it is in progress, delete the  target
       DB  cluster  snapshot  identified  by TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier
       while that DB cluster snapshot is in "copying" status.

SYNOPSIS
            copy-db-cluster-snapshot
          --source-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier <value>
          --target-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier <value>
          [--kms-key-id <value>]
          [--pre-signed-url <value>]
          [--copy-tags | --no-copy-tags]
          [--tags <value>]

          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The  identifier  of  the DB cluster snapshot to copy. This parameter
          isn't case-sensitive.

          You can't copy an encrypted, shared DB  cluster  snapshot  from  one
          Amazon Web Services Region to another.

          Constraints:

          o Must specify a valid system snapshot in the "available" state.

          o If  the  source snapshot is in the same Amazon Web Services Region
            as the copy, specify a valid DB snapshot identifier.

          o If the source snapshot is  in  a  different  Amazon  Web  Services
            Region than the copy, specify a valid DB cluster snapshot ARN. For
            more information, go to Copying Snapshots Across Amazon  Web  Ser-
            vices Regions in the Amazon Aurora User Guide.

          Example: my-cluster-snapshot1

       --target-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The  identifier  of  the  new DB cluster snapshot to create from the
          source DB cluster snapshot. This parameter isn't case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

          o First character must be a letter.

          o Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

          Example: my-cluster-snapshot2

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for an encrypted DB clus-
          ter  snapshot. The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key
          ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the  Amazon  Web  Services
          KMS key.

          If  you  copy  an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from your Amazon Web
          Services account, you can specify a value for  KmsKeyId  to  encrypt
          the  copy  with  a  new  KMS  key.  If you don't specify a value for
          KmsKeyId , then the copy of the DB  cluster  snapshot  is  encrypted
          with the same KMS key as the source DB cluster snapshot.

          If  you  copy  an  encrypted DB cluster snapshot that is shared from
          another Amazon Web Services account, then you must specify  a  value
          for KmsKeyId .

          To  copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot to another Amazon Web Ser-
          vices Region, you must set KmsKeyId to the Amazon Web  Services  KMS
          key identifier you want to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster
          snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. KMS keys are
          specific to the Amazon Web Services Region that they are created in,
          and you can't use KMS keys from one Amazon Web  Services  Region  in
          another Amazon Web Services Region.

          If  you  copy an unencrypted DB cluster snapshot and specify a value
          for the KmsKeyId parameter, an error is returned.

       --pre-signed-url (string)
          The URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request  for  the
          CopyDBClusterSnapshot  API  action in the Amazon Web Services Region
          that contains the source DB cluster snapshot to copy. The  PreSigne-
          dUrl  parameter  must  be  used when copying an encrypted DB cluster
          snapshot from another Amazon Web Services Region. Don't specify Pre-
          SignedUrl  when  you are copying an encrypted DB cluster snapshot in
          the same Amazon Web Services Region.

          The pre-signed URL must be a valid request  for  the  CopyDBCluster-
          Snapshot  API  action  that can be executed in the source Amazon Web
          Services Region that contains the encrypted DB cluster  snapshot  to
          be  copied.  The  pre-signed  URL request must contain the following
          parameter values:

          o KmsKeyId - The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for the  KMS
            key  to  use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the
            destination Amazon Web Services Region. This is the  same  identi-
            fier  for  both the CopyDBClusterSnapshot action that is called in
            the destination Amazon Web Services Region, and  the  action  con-
            tained in the pre-signed URL.

          o DestinationRegion  -  The  name  of the Amazon Web Services Region
            that the DB cluster snapshot is to be created in.

          o SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier - The DB cluster snapshot  iden-
            tifier  for  the  encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. This
            identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  format  for
            the  source  Amazon  Web  Services Region. For example, if you are
            copying an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from the us-west-2 Amazon
            Web  Services  Region, then your SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier
            looks         like         the         following          example:
            arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster-snapshot:aurora-clus-
            ter1-snapshot-20161115 .

          To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed  request,  see
          Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services
          Signature Version 4) and Signature Version 4 Signing Process .

          NOTE:
              If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you
              can  specify  SourceRegion  (or  --source-region  for  the  CLI)
              instead  of   specifying   PreSignedUrl   manually.   Specifying
              SourceRegion  autogenerates  a  pre-signed  URL  that is a valid
              request for the operation that can be  executed  in  the  source
              Amazon Web Services Region.

       --copy-tags | --no-copy-tags (boolean)
          A  value  that indicates whether to copy all tags from the source DB
          cluster snapshot to the target DB cluster snapshot. By default, tags
          are not copied.

       --tags (list)
          A  list  of  tags.  For  more  information,  see  Tagging Amazon RDS
          Resources in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

          (structure)
              Metadata assigned to an Amazon  RDS  resource  consisting  of  a
              key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 A  key  is the required name of the tag. The string value can
                 be from 1 to 128 Unicode characters in length  and  can't  be
                 prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain only
                 the set of Unicode letters, digits,  white-space,  '_',  '.',
                 ':',    '/',    '=',    '+',    '-',    '@'    (Java   regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A value is the optional value of the tag.  The  string  value
                 can  be  from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length and can't
                 be prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can  only  contain
                 only  the  set  of Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_',
                 '.',  ':',   '/',   '=',   '+',   '-',   '@'   (Java   regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --source-region (string)
          The ID of the region that contains the snapshot to be copied.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
