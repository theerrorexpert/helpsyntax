NAME
       describe-db-proxy-target-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  DB  proxy  target  groups,  represented by
       DBProxyTargetGroup data structures.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-db-proxy-target-groups is a paginated operation. Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: TargetGroups

SYNOPSIS
            describe-db-proxy-target-groups
          --db-proxy-name <value>
          [--target-group-name <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-proxy-name (string)
          The identifier of the DBProxy associated with the target group.

       --target-group-name (string)
          The identifier of the DBProxyTargetGroup to describe.

       --filters (list)
          This parameter is not currently supported.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              IDs. The filters supported by a  describe  operation  are  docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One  or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TargetGroups -> (list)
          An   arbitrary  number  of  DBProxyTargetGroup  objects,  containing
          details of the corresponding target groups.

          (structure)
              Represents a set of RDS DB instances,  Aurora  DB  clusters,  or
              both  that  a proxy can connect to. Currently, each target group
              is associated with exactly one RDS  DB  instance  or  Aurora  DB
              cluster.

              This   data   type   is  used  as  a  response  element  in  the
              DescribeDBProxyTargetGroups action.

              DBProxyName -> (string)
                 The identifier for the RDS proxy associated with this  target
                 group.

              TargetGroupName -> (string)
                 The identifier for the target group. This name must be unique
                 for all target groups  owned  by  your  Amazon  Web  Services
                 account in the specified Amazon Web Services Region.

              TargetGroupArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) representing the target group.

              IsDefault -> (boolean)
                 Whether this target group is the first one used  for  connec-
                 tion  requests by the associated proxy. Because each proxy is
                 currently associated with a single  target  group,  currently
                 this setting is always true .

              Status -> (string)
                 The  current  status of this target group. A status of avail-
                 able means the target group is correctly  associated  with  a
                 database.  Other  values  indicate that you must wait for the
                 target group to be ready, or take some action to  resolve  an
                 issue.

              ConnectionPoolConfig -> (structure)
                 The settings that determine the size and behavior of the con-
                 nection pool for the target group.

                 MaxConnectionsPercent -> (integer)
                     The maximum size of the connection pool for  each  target
                     in a target group. The value is expressed as a percentage
                     of the max_connections setting for the RDS DB instance or
                     Aurora DB cluster used by the target group.

                 MaxIdleConnectionsPercent -> (integer)
                     Controls how actively the proxy closes idle database con-
                     nections in the connection pool. The value  is  expressed
                     as  a  percentage  of the max_connections setting for the
                     RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster used by  the  target
                     group.  With  a  high value, the proxy leaves a high per-
                     centage of idle database connections open.  A  low  value
                     causes  the  proxy  to  close  more  idle connections and
                     return them to the database.

                 ConnectionBorrowTimeout -> (integer)
                     The number of seconds for a proxy to wait for  a  connec-
                     tion  to  become  available  in the connection pool. Only
                     applies when the proxy has opened its maximum  number  of
                     connections and all connections are busy with client ses-
                     sions.

                 SessionPinningFilters -> (list)
                     Each item in the list represents a class  of  SQL  opera-
                     tions  that normally cause all later statements in a ses-
                     sion using a proxy to be pinned to  the  same  underlying
                     database  connection.  Including  an  item  in  the  list
                     exempts that class of SQL  operations  from  the  pinning
                     behavior.   Currently,   the   only   allowed   value  is
                     EXCLUDE_VARIABLE_SETS .

                     (string)

                 InitQuery -> (string)
                     One or more SQL statements for  the  proxy  to  run  when
                     opening each new database connection. Typically used with
                     SET statements to make  sure  that  each  connection  has
                     identical  settings  such as time zone and character set.
                     This setting is empty by  default.  For  multiple  state-
                     ments,  use  semicolons  as  the  separator. You can also
                     include multiple variables in  a  single  SET  statement,
                     such as SET x=1, y=2 .

              CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the target group was first created.

              UpdatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the target group was last updated.

       Marker -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter is specified, the response includes  only  records  beyond
          the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .
