DESCRIBE-DB-PROXY-ENDPOINTS()                    DESCRIBE-DB-PROXY-ENDPOINTS()



NAME
       describe-db-proxy-endpoints -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about DB proxy endpoints.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-db-proxy-endpoints  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: DBProxyEndpoints

SYNOPSIS
            describe-db-proxy-endpoints
          [--db-proxy-name <value>]
          [--db-proxy-endpoint-name <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-proxy-name (string)
          The name of the DB proxy whose endpoints you want  to  describe.  If
          you  omit  this parameter, the output includes information about all
          DB proxy endpoints associated with all your DB proxies.

       --db-proxy-endpoint-name (string)
          The name of a DB proxy endpoint to describe. If you omit this param-
          eter,  the  output includes information about all DB proxy endpoints
          associated with the specified proxy.

       --filters (list)
          This parameter is not currently supported.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              IDs.  The  filters  supported  by a describe operation are docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are  case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DBProxyEndpoints -> (list)
          The list of ProxyEndpoint objects returned by the API operation.

          (structure)
              The data structure representing an endpoint associated with a DB
              proxy. RDS automatically creates one endpoint for each DB proxy.
              For Aurora DB clusters, you can associate  additional  endpoints
              with  the  same  DB  proxy. These endpoints can be read/write or
              read-only. They can also reside in different VPCs than the asso-
              ciated DB proxy.

              This   data   type   is  used  as  a  response  element  in  the
              DescribeDBProxyEndpoints operation.

              DBProxyEndpointName -> (string)
                 The name for the DB proxy endpoint. An identifier must  begin
                 with  a  letter  and must contain only ASCII letters, digits,
                 and hyphens; it can't end with a hyphen or contain  two  con-
                 secutive hyphens.

              DBProxyEndpointArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the DB proxy endpoint.

              DBProxyName -> (string)
                 The  identifier for the DB proxy that is associated with this
                 DB proxy endpoint.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current status of this DB proxy  endpoint.  A  status  of
                 available  means  the  endpoint  is ready to handle requests.
                 Other values indicate that you must wait for the endpoint  to
                 be ready, or take some action to resolve an issue.

              VpcId -> (string)
                 Provides the VPC ID of the DB proxy endpoint.

              VpcSecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                 Provides a list of VPC security groups that the DB proxy end-
                 point belongs to.

                 (string)

              VpcSubnetIds -> (list)
                 The EC2 subnet IDs for the DB proxy endpoint.

                 (string)

              Endpoint -> (string)
                 The endpoint that you can use to connect to the DB proxy. You
                 include  the  endpoint  value  in the connection string for a
                 database client application.

              CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the DB proxy endpoint was  first  cre-
                 ated.

              TargetRole -> (string)
                 A  value  that indicates whether the DB proxy endpoint can be
                 used for read/write or read-only operations.

              IsDefault -> (boolean)
                 A value that indicates whether this endpoint is  the  default
                 endpoint  for  the associated DB proxy. Default DB proxy end-
                 points always have  read/write  capability.  Other  endpoints
                 that you associate with the DB proxy can be either read/write
                 or read-only.

       Marker -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter  is  specified,  the response includes only records beyond
          the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .
