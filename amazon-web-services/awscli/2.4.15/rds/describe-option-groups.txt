DESCRIBE-OPTION-GROUPS()                              DESCRIBE-OPTION-GROUPS()



NAME
       describe-option-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the available option groups.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-option-groups is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: OptionGroupsList

SYNOPSIS
            describe-option-groups
          [--option-group-name <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--engine-name <value>]
          [--major-engine-version <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --option-group-name (string)
          The name of the option group to describe. Can't be supplied together
          with EngineName or MajorEngineVersion.

       --filters (list)
          This parameter isn't currently supported.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              IDs. The filters supported by a  describe  operation  are  docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One  or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --engine-name (string)
          Filters the list of option groups to only include groups  associated
          with a specific database engine.

          Valid Values:

          o mariadb

          o mysql

          o oracle-ee

          o oracle-ee-cdb

          o oracle-se2

          o oracle-se2-cdb

          o postgres

          o sqlserver-ee

          o sqlserver-se

          o sqlserver-ex

          o sqlserver-web

       --major-engine-version (string)
          Filters  the list of option groups to only include groups associated
          with a specific database engine version. If specified, then  Engine-
          Name must also be specified.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe the available option groups

       The following describe-option-groups example lists the  options  groups
       for an Oracle Database 19c instance.

          aws rds describe-option-groups \
              --engine-name oracle-ee \
              --major-engine-version 19

       Output:

          {
              "OptionGroupsList": [
                  {
                      "OptionGroupName": "default:oracle-ee-19",
                      "OptionGroupDescription": "Default option group for oracle-ee 19",
                      "EngineName": "oracle-ee",
                      "MajorEngineVersion": "19",
                      "Options": [],
                      "AllowsVpcAndNonVpcInstanceMemberships": true,
                      "OptionGroupArn": "arn:aws:rds:us-west-1:111122223333:og:default:oracle-ee-19"
                  }
              ]
          }

                        If the option requires access to a port, then this VPC
                        security group allows access to the port.

                        (structure)
                            This data type is used as a response  element  for
                            queries on VPC security group membership.

                            VpcSecurityGroupId -> (string)

                 instances.

              VpcId -> (string)
                 If  AllowsVpcAndNonVpcInstanceMemberships  is  false  ,  this
                 field  is  blank. If AllowsVpcAndNonVpcInstanceMemberships is
                 true and this field is blank, then this option group  can  be
                 applied to both VPC and non-VPC instances. If this field con-
                 tains a value, then this option group can only be applied  to
                 instances that are in the VPC indicated by this field.

              OptionGroupArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the option group.
