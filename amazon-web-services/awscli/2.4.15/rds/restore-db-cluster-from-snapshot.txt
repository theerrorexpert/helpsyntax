RESTORE-DB-CLUSTER-FROM-SNAPSHOT()          RESTORE-DB-CLUSTER-FROM-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       restore-db-cluster-from-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new DB cluster from a DB snapshot or DB cluster snapshot.

       The  target  DB  cluster  is  created  from  the source snapshot with a
       default configuration. If you don't specify a security group,  the  new
       DB cluster is associated with the default security group.

       NOTE:
          This  action  only restores the DB cluster, not the DB instances for
          that DB cluster. You must invoke the CreateDBInstance action to cre-
          ate DB instances for the restored DB cluster, specifying the identi-
          fier of the restored DB cluster in  DBClusterIdentifier  .  You  can
          create  DB  instances  only  after  the RestoreDBClusterFromSnapshot
          action has completed and the DB cluster is available.

       For more information on Amazon Aurora DB clusters, see What  is  Amazon
       Aurora? in the Amazon Aurora User Guide.

       For  more information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see Multi-AZ deployments
       with two readable standby DB instances in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

       NOTE:
          The Multi-AZ DB clusters feature is in preview  and  is  subject  to
          change.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier to use when restoring  an
          encrypted DB cluster from a DB snapshot or DB cluster snapshot.

          The  Amazon  Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID,
          alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a dif-
          ferent  Amazon  Web  Services  account, specify the key ARN or alias
          ARN.

          following occurs:

          o If the DB snapshot or DB cluster snapshot in SnapshotIdentifier is
            encrypted, then the restored DB cluster is encrypted using the KMS
            key  that  was used to encrypt the DB snapshot or DB cluster snap-
            shot.

          o If the DB snapshot or DB cluster  snapshot  in  SnapshotIdentifier
            isn't encrypted, then the restored DB cluster isn't encrypted.

              A  value  that  indicates whether to allow or disallow automatic
              pause for an Aurora DB cluster in serverless DB engine  mode.  A
              DB  cluster can be paused only when it's idle (it has no connec-
              tions).

              NOTE:
                 If a DB cluster is paused for more than seven  days,  the  DB
                 cluster might be backed up with a snapshot. In this case, the
                 DB cluster is restored when there is a request to connect  to

              plyCapacityChange or RollbackCapacityChange .
                 ForceApplyCapacityChange  sets  the capacity to the specified
                 value as soon as possible.

                 RollbackCapacityChange , the default,  ignores  the  capacity
                 change  if a scaling point isn't found in the timeout period.

              WARNING:
                 If you specify ForceApplyCapacityChange  ,  connections  that
                 prevent  Aurora Serverless from finding a scaling point might
                 be dropped.

              For more information, see Autoscaling for Aurora  Serverless  in
              the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

          SecondsBeforeTimeout -> (integer)
              The  amount of time, in seconds, that Aurora Serverless tries to
              find a scaling point to perform seamless scaling before  enforc-
              ing the timeout action. The default is 300.

              Specify a value between 60 and 600 seconds.

       --db-cluster-parameter-group-name (string)
          The name of the DB cluster parameter group to associate with this DB
          cluster. If this argument is omitted, the default DB cluster parame-
          ter group for the specified engine is used.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match the name of an existing default DB cluster
            parameter group.

       --storage-type (string)
          Specifies  the  storage  type  to  be  associated  with  the each DB
          instance in the Multi-AZ DB cluster.

          Valid values: io1

          When specified, a value for the Iops parameter is required.

          Default: io1

          Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters

       --iops (integer)
          The amount of Provisioned IOPS (input/output operations per  second)
          to  be  initially  allocated for each DB instance in the Multi-AZ DB
          cluster.

          For information about valid Iops values, see Amazon RDS  Provisioned
          IOPS Storage to Improve Performance in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          Constraints:  Must  be  a  multiple between .5 and 50 of the storage
          amount for the DB instance.

          Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters

       --publicly-accessible | --no-publicly-accessible (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether the DB cluster is  publicly  accessi-
          ble.

          When  the  DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System
          (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB
          cluster's  virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP
          address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC. Access to the DB clus-
          ter  is  ultimately  controlled  by the security group it uses. That
          public access is not permitted if the security group assigned to the
          DB cluster doesn't permit it.

          When  the DB cluster isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB
          cluster with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

          Default: The default behavior varies depending on whether  DBSubnet-
          GroupName is specified.

          If  DBSubnetGroupName  isn't specified, and PubliclyAccessible isn't
          specified, the following applies:

          o If the default VPC in the target Region doesnt  have  an  internet
            gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private.

          o If  the  default  VPC in the target Region has an internet gateway
            attached to it, the DB cluster is public.

          If DBSubnetGroupName  is  specified,  and  PubliclyAccessible  isn't
          specified, the following applies:

          o If  the  subnets  are  part  of a VPC that doesnt have an internet
            gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private.

          o If the subnets are part of a VPC  that  has  an  internet  gateway
            attached to it, the DB cluster is public.

          Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DBCluster -> (structure)
          Contains the details of an Amazon Aurora DB cluster or  Multi-AZ  DB
          cluster.

          For  an  Amazon  Aurora  DB  cluster,  this  data  type is used as a
          response element in the operations CreateDBCluster , DeleteDBCluster
          ,  DescribeDBClusters  ,  FailoverDBCluster , ModifyDBCluster , Pro-
          moteReadReplicaDBCluster , RestoreDBClusterFromS3  ,  RestoreDBClus-
          terFromSnapshot  ,  RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime , StartDBCluster ,
          and StopDBCluster .

          For a Multi-AZ DB cluster, this data type is used as a response ele-
          ment   in   the   operations  CreateDBCluster  ,  DeleteDBCluster  ,
          DescribeDBClusters , FailoverDBCluster , ModifyDBCluster , RebootDB-
          Cluster  ,  RestoreDBClusterFromSnapshot  ,  and RestoreDBClusterTo-
          PointInTime .

          For more information on Amazon Aurora DB clusters, see What is  Ama-
          zon Aurora? in the Amazon Aurora User Guide.

          For  more  information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see Multi-AZ deploy-
          ments with two readable standby DB instances in the Amazon RDS  User
          Guide.

              The Multi-AZ DB clusters feature is in preview and is subject to
              change.

          AllocatedStorage -> (integer)
              For all database engines except Amazon Aurora,  AllocatedStorage
              specifies  the  allocated  storage  size in gibibytes (GiB). For
              Aurora, AllocatedStorage always returns  1,  because  Aurora  DB
              cluster  storage  size  isn't  fixed,  but instead automatically
              adjusts as needed.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              Provides the list of Availability Zones (AZs) where instances in
              the DB cluster can be created.

              (string)

          BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              Specifies  the  number  of days for which automatic DB snapshots
              are retained.

          CharacterSetName -> (string)
              If present, specifies the name of the character  set  that  this
              cluster is associated with.

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              Contains  the  name  of  the initial database of this DB cluster
              that was provided at create time, if one was specified when  the
              DB  cluster was created. This same name is returned for the life
              of the DB cluster.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains a user-supplied DB cluster identifier. This  identifier
              is the unique key that identifies a DB cluster.

          DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
              Specifies  the name of the DB cluster parameter group for the DB
              cluster.

          DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
              Specifies information on the subnet group associated with the DB
              cluster,  including  the  name,  description, and subnets in the
              subnet group.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the current state of this DB cluster.

          AutomaticRestartTime -> (timestamp)
              The time when a stopped DB cluster is restarted automatically.

          PercentProgress -> (string)
              Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.

          EarliestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              The earliest time to which  a  database  can  be  restored  with
              point-in-time restore.

          Endpoint -> (string)
              Specifies  the  connection  endpoint for the primary instance of
              the DB cluster.

          ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
              The reader endpoint for the DB cluster. The reader endpoint  for
              a  DB cluster load-balances connections across the Aurora Repli-
              cas that are available in a DB cluster. As clients  request  new
              connections  to the reader endpoint, Aurora distributes the con-
              nection requests among the Aurora Replicas in  the  DB  cluster.
              This  functionality  can  help balance your read workload across
              multiple Aurora Replicas in your DB cluster.

              If a failover occurs, and the Aurora Replica that you  are  con-
              nected  to  is promoted to be the primary instance, your connec-
              tion is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to other
              Aurora  Replicas  in  the cluster, you can then reconnect to the
              reader endpoint.

          CustomEndpoints -> (list)

                     instance for the DB cluster and false otherwise.

                 DBClusterParameterGroupStatus -> (string)
                     Specifies the status of the DB  cluster  parameter  group
                     for this member of the DB cluster.

                 PromotionTier -> (integer)
                     A  value  that  specifies  the  order  in which an Aurora
                     Replica is promoted to the primary instance after a fail-

              AutoPause -> (boolean)
                 A value that indicates whether automatic pause is allowed for
                 the Aurora DB cluster in serverless DB engine mode.

                 When  the  value  is set to false for an Aurora Serverless DB
                 cluster, the DB cluster automatically resumes.

              SecondsUntilAutoPause -> (integer)
                 The remaining amount of time, in seconds, before  the  Aurora
                 DB  cluster in serverless mode is paused. A DB cluster can be
                 paused only when it's idle (it has no connections).

              TimeoutAction -> (string)
                 The action that occurs when Aurora times out while attempting
                 to  change  the capacity of an Aurora Serverless cluster. The
                 value is either ForceApplyCapacityChange or RollbackCapacity-
                 Change .
                     ForceApplyCapacityChange , the default, sets the capacity
                     to the specified value as soon as possible.

                     RollbackCapacityChange ignores the capacity change  if  a
                     scaling point isn't found in the timeout period.

              SecondsBeforeTimeout -> (integer)
                 The  number of seconds before scaling times out. What happens
                 when an attempted scaling action times out is  determined  by
                 the TimeoutAction setting.

          DeletionProtection -> (boolean)
              Indicates if the DB cluster has deletion protection enabled. The
              database can't be deleted when deletion protection is enabled.

          HttpEndpointEnabled -> (boolean)
              A value that indicates whether the HTTP endpoint for  an  Aurora
              Serverless DB cluster is enabled.

              When  enabled,  the  HTTP endpoint provides a connectionless web
              service API for running SQL queries on the Aurora Serverless  DB
              cluster.  You  can  also query your database from inside the RDS
              console with the query editor.

              For more information, see Using the Data API for Aurora  Server-
              less in the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

          ActivityStreamMode -> (string)
              The  mode  of the database activity stream. Database events such
              as a change or access generate an  activity  stream  event.  The
              database session can handle these events either synchronously or
              asynchronously.

          ActivityStreamStatus -> (string)
              The status of the database activity stream.

          ActivityStreamKmsKeyId -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier used  for  encrypting
              messages in the database activity stream.

                     The name of the IAM role to be used when making API calls
                     to the Directory Service.

          TagList -> (list)
              A  list  of  tags.  For more information, see Tagging Amazon RDS
              Resources in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

                 Metadata assigned to an Amazon RDS resource consisting  of  a
                 key-value pair.

                 Key -> (string)
                     A  key  is the required name of the tag. The string value
                     can be from 1 to 128 Unicode  characters  in  length  and
                     can't be prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can only
                     contain  only  the  set  of  Unicode   letters,   digits,
                     white-space, '_', '.', ':', '/', '=', '+', '-', '@' (Java
                     regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

                 Value -> (string)
                     A value is the optional value  of  the  tag.  The  string
                     value  can  be from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length
                     and can't be prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string  can
                     only  contain  only  the  set of Unicode letters, digits,
                     white-space, '_', '.', ':', '/', '=', '+', '-', '@' (Java

          GlobalWriteForwardingStatus -> (string)
              Specifies  whether a secondary cluster in an Aurora global data-
              base has write forwarding enabled, not enabled,  or  is  in  the
              process of enabling it.

          GlobalWriteForwardingRequested -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether you have requested to enable write forwarding
              for a secondary cluster in an Aurora  global  database.  Because
              write  forwarding takes time to enable, check the value of Glob-
              alWriteForwardingStatus to confirm that  the  request  has  com-
              pleted  before using the write forwarding feature for this clus-
              ter.

          PendingModifiedValues -> (structure)
              A value that specifies that changes to the DB cluster are  pend-
              ing.  This  element  is  only included when changes are pending.
              Specific changes are identified by subelements.

              PendingCloudwatchLogsExports -> (structure)
                 A list of the log types whose configuration is still pending.
                 In  other  words, these log types are in the process of being
                 activated or deactivated.

                 LogTypesToEnable -> (list)
                     Log types that are in the process of  being  deactivated.
                     After  they  are  deactivated,  these  log  types  aren't
                     exported to CloudWatch Logs.

                     (string)

                 LogTypesToDisable -> (list)
                     Log types that are in the process of being enabled. After
                     they  are enabled, these log types are exported to Cloud-
                     Watch Logs.

                     (string)

              DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)

              The name of the compute and memory  capacity  class  of  the  DB
              instance.

              This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

          StorageType -> (string)
              The storage type associated with the DB cluster.

              This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

          PubliclyAccessible -> (boolean)
              Specifies the accessibility options for the DB instance.

              When  the  DB  instance  is publicly accessible, its Domain Name
              System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private  IP  address  from
              within  the  DB  instance's  virtual  private  cloud  (VPC).  It
              resolves to the  public  IP  address  from  outside  of  the  DB
              instance's  VPC.  Access  to  the DB instance is ultimately con-
              trolled by the security group it uses. That public access is not
              permitted  if  the  security  group  assigned to the DB instance
              doesn't permit it.

              When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an  inter-
              nal  DB  instance  with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP
              address.

              For more information, see  CreateDBInstance .

              This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

              ing metrics are collected for the DB cluster.

              This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

          MonitoringRoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS to send Enhanced Moni-
              toring metrics to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

              This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

          PerformanceInsightsEnabled -> (boolean)
              True  if Performance Insights is enabled for the DB cluster, and
              otherwise false.

              This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

          PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services KMS key  identifier  for  encryption  of
              Performance Insights data.

              The  Amazon  Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key
              ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

              This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.
