CREATE-DB-PROXY-ENDPOINT()                          CREATE-DB-PROXY-ENDPOINT()



NAME
       create-db-proxy-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a DBProxyEndpoint . Only applies to proxies that are associated
       with Aurora DB clusters. You can use  DB  proxy  endpoints  to  specify
       read/write  or  read-only access to the DB cluster. You can also use DB
       proxy endpoints to access a DB proxy through a different VPC  than  the
       proxy's default VPC.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-db-proxy-endpoint
          --db-proxy-name <value>
          --db-proxy-endpoint-name <value>
          --vpc-subnet-ids <value>
          [--vpc-security-group-ids <value>]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-proxy-name (string)
          The  name of the DB proxy associated with the DB proxy endpoint that
          you create.

       --db-proxy-endpoint-name (string)
          The name of the DB proxy endpoint to create.

       --vpc-subnet-ids (list)
          The VPC subnet IDs for the DB proxy endpoint that  you  create.  You
          can  specify  a different set of subnet IDs than for the original DB
          proxy.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --vpc-security-group-ids (list)
          The VPC security group IDs for the DB proxy endpoint that  you  cre-
          ate.  You can specify a different set of security group IDs than for
          the original DB proxy. The default is the default security group for
          the VPC.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --target-role (string)
          A value that indicates whether the DB proxy endpoint can be used for
          read/write or read-only operations. The default is READ_WRITE .

          Possible values:

          o READ_WRITE

          o READ_ONLY

       --tags (list)
          A list of  tags.  For  more  information,  see  Tagging  Amazon  RDS
          Resources in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

          (structure)
              Metadata  assigned  to  an  Amazon  RDS resource consisting of a
              key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 A key is the required name of the tag. The string  value  can
                 be  from  1  to 128 Unicode characters in length and can't be
                 prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain only
                 the  set  of  Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_', '.',
                 ':',   '/',    '=',    '+',    '-',    '@'    (Java    regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A  value  is  the optional value of the tag. The string value
                 can be from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length  and  can't
                 be  prefixed  with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain
                 only the set of Unicode letters,  digits,  white-space,  '_',
                 '.',   ':',   '/',   '=',   '+',   '-',   '@'   (Java  regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DBProxyEndpoint -> (structure)
          The DBProxyEndpoint object that is created by the API operation. The
          DB proxy endpoint that you create might provide capabilities such as
          read/write or read-only operations, or using a  different  VPC  than
          the proxy's default VPC.

          DBProxyEndpointName -> (string)
              The  name  for  the  DB proxy endpoint. An identifier must begin
              with a letter and must contain only ASCII letters,  digits,  and
              hyphens;  it  can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive
              hyphens.

          DBProxyEndpointArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the DB proxy endpoint.

          DBProxyName -> (string)
              The identifier for the DB proxy that is associated with this  DB
              proxy endpoint.

          Status -> (string)
              The current status of this DB proxy endpoint. A status of avail-
              able means the endpoint is ready to handle requests. Other  val-
              ues indicate that you must wait for the endpoint to be ready, or
              take some action to resolve an issue.

          VpcId -> (string)
              Provides the VPC ID of the DB proxy endpoint.

          VpcSecurityGroupIds -> (list)
              Provides a list of VPC security groups that the  DB  proxy  end-
              point belongs to.

              (string)

          VpcSubnetIds -> (list)
              The EC2 subnet IDs for the DB proxy endpoint.

              (string)

          Endpoint -> (string)
              The  endpoint  that  you can use to connect to the DB proxy. You
              include the endpoint value in the connection string for a  data-
              base client application.

          CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
              The  date and time when the DB proxy endpoint was first created.

          TargetRole -> (string)
              A value that indicates whether the DB proxy endpoint can be used
              for read/write or read-only operations.

          IsDefault -> (boolean)
              A value that indicates whether this endpoint is the default end-
              point for the associated DB proxy. Default  DB  proxy  endpoints
              always  have read/write capability. Other endpoints that you as-
              sociate with the DB proxy can be either read/write or read-only.
