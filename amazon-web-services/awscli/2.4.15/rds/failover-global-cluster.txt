FAILOVER-GLOBAL-CLUSTER()                            FAILOVER-GLOBAL-CLUSTER()



NAME
       failover-global-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Initiates  the failover process for an Aurora global database ( Global-
       Cluster ).

       A failover for an Aurora global  database  promotes  one  of  secondary
       read-only DB clusters to be the primary DB cluster and demotes the pri-
       mary DB cluster to being a secondary (read-only) DB cluster.  In  other
       words,  the  role  of  the  current primary DB cluster and the selected
       (target) DB cluster are switched. The  selected  secondary  DB  cluster
       assumes full read/write capabilities for the Aurora global database.

       For  more  information about failing over an Amazon Aurora global data-
       base, see Managed planned failover for Amazon Aurora  global  databases
       in the Amazon Aurora User Guide.

       NOTE:
          This  action  applies  to   GlobalCluster  (Aurora global databases)
          only. Use this action only on healthy Aurora global  databases  with
          running  Aurora DB clusters and no Region-wide outages, to test dis-
          aster recovery scenarios or to reconfigure your Aurora global  data-
          base topology.

SYNOPSIS
            failover-global-cluster
          --global-cluster-identifier <value>
          --target-db-cluster-identifier <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-cluster-identifier (string)
          Identifier  of  the  Aurora  global  database ( GlobalCluster ) that
          should be failed over. The identifier is the unique key assigned  by
          the  user  when  the  Aurora  global  database was created. In other
          words, it's the name of the Aurora global database that you want  to
          fail over.

          Constraints:

          o Must  match  the  identifier of an existing  GlobalCluster (Aurora
            global database).

       --target-db-cluster-identifier (string)
          Identifier of the secondary Aurora DB cluster that you want to  pro-
          mote  to  primary  for the Aurora global database ( GlobalCluster .)
          Use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the identifier so that Aurora
          can locate the cluster in its Amazon Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     global database with which it is associated.

                 GlobalWriteForwardingStatus -> (string)
                     Specifies whether a secondary cluster in an Aurora global
                     database has write forwarding enabled, not enabled, or is

                 o failing-over  This status covers the range of Aurora inter-
                   nal operations that take place during the failover process,
                   such as demoting the primary Aurora DB  cluster,  promoting
