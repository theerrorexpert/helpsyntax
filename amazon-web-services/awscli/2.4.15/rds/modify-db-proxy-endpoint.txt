MODIFY-DB-PROXY-ENDPOINT()                          MODIFY-DB-PROXY-ENDPOINT()



NAME
       modify-db-proxy-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       Changes the settings for an existing DB proxy endpoint.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-db-proxy-endpoint
          --db-proxy-endpoint-name <value>
          [--new-db-proxy-endpoint-name <value>]
          [--vpc-security-group-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-proxy-endpoint-name (string)
          The  name  of  the DB proxy sociated with the DB proxy endpoint that
          you want to modify.

       --new-db-proxy-endpoint-name (string)
          The new identifier for the  DBProxyEndpoint  .  An  identifier  must
          begin with a letter and must contain only ASCII letters, digits, and
          hyphens; it can't end with  a  hyphen  or  contain  two  consecutive
          hyphens.

       --vpc-security-group-ids (list)
          The  VPC  security  group IDs for the DB proxy endpoint. When the DB
          proxy endpoint uses a different VPC than  the  original  proxy,  you
          also  specify  a  different  set  of security group IDs than for the
          original proxy.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DBProxyEndpoint -> (structure)
          The DBProxyEndpoint object representing the new settings for the  DB
          proxy endpoint.

          DBProxyEndpointName -> (string)
              The  name  for  the  DB proxy endpoint. An identifier must begin
              with a letter and must contain only ASCII letters,  digits,  and
              hyphens;  it  can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive
              hyphens.

          DBProxyEndpointArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the DB proxy endpoint.

          DBProxyName -> (string)
              The identifier for the DB proxy that is associated with this  DB
              proxy endpoint.

          Status -> (string)
              The current status of this DB proxy endpoint. A status of avail-
              able means the endpoint is ready to handle requests. Other  val-
              ues indicate that you must wait for the endpoint to be ready, or
              take some action to resolve an issue.

          VpcId -> (string)
              Provides the VPC ID of the DB proxy endpoint.

          VpcSecurityGroupIds -> (list)
              Provides a list of VPC security groups that the  DB  proxy  end-
              point belongs to.

              (string)

          VpcSubnetIds -> (list)
              The EC2 subnet IDs for the DB proxy endpoint.

              (string)

          Endpoint -> (string)
              The  endpoint  that  you can use to connect to the DB proxy. You
              include the endpoint value in the connection string for a  data-
              base client application.

          CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
              The  date and time when the DB proxy endpoint was first created.

          TargetRole -> (string)
              A value that indicates whether the DB proxy endpoint can be used
              for read/write or read-only operations.

          IsDefault -> (boolean)
              A value that indicates whether this endpoint is the default end-
              point for the associated DB proxy. Default  DB  proxy  endpoints
              always  have read/write capability. Other endpoints that you as-
              sociate with the DB proxy can be either read/write or read-only.
