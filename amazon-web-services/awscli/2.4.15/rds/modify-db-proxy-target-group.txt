NAME
       modify-db-proxy-target-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies the properties of a DBProxyTargetGroup .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-db-proxy-target-group
          --target-group-name <value>
          --db-proxy-name <value>
          [--connection-pool-config <value>]
          [--new-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --target-group-name (string)
          The name of the new target group to assign to the proxy.

       --db-proxy-name (string)
          The name of the new proxy to which to assign the target group.

       --connection-pool-config (structure)
          The  settings that determine the size and behavior of the connection
          pool for the target group.

          MaxConnectionsPercent -> (integer)
              The maximum size of the connection pool for  each  target  in  a
              target  group.  The  value  is  expressed as a percentage of the
              max_connections setting for the RDS DB  instance  or  Aurora  DB
              cluster used by the target group.

              Default: 100

              Constraints: between 1 and 100

          MaxIdleConnectionsPercent -> (integer)
              Controls how actively the proxy closes idle database connections
              in the connection pool. The value is expressed as  a  percentage
              of the max_connections setting for the RDS DB instance or Aurora
              DB cluster used by the target group.  With  a  high  value,  the
              proxy  leaves  a  high  percentage  of idle database connections
              open. A low value causes the proxy to close  more  idle  connec-
              tions and return them to the database.

              Default: 50

              Constraints: between 0 and MaxConnectionsPercent

          ConnectionBorrowTimeout -> (integer)
              The  number  of  seconds for a proxy to wait for a connection to
              become available in the connection pool. Only applies  when  the
              proxy  has opened its maximum number of connections and all con-
              nections are busy with client sessions.

              Default: 120

              Constraints: between 1 and 3600, or 0 representing unlimited

          SessionPinningFilters -> (list)
              Each item in the list represents a class of SQL operations  that
              normally  cause  all later statements in a session using a proxy
              to be pinned to the same underlying database connection. Includ-
              ing  an  item  in  the list exempts that class of SQL operations
              from the pinning behavior.

              Default: no session pinning filters

              (string)

          InitQuery -> (string)
              One or more SQL statements for the proxy  to  run  when  opening
              each new database connection. Typically used with SET statements
              to make sure that each connection has identical settings such as
              time  zone and character set. For multiple statements, use semi-
              colons as the separator. You can also include multiple variables
              in a single SET statement, such as SET x=1, y=2 .

              Default: no initialization query

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MaxConnectionsPercent=integer,MaxIdleConnectionsPercent=integer,ConnectionBorrowTimeout=integer,SessionPinningFilters=string,string,InitQuery=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MaxConnectionsPercent": integer,
            "MaxIdleConnectionsPercent": integer,
            "ConnectionBorrowTimeout": integer,
            "SessionPinningFilters": ["string", ...],
            "InitQuery": "string"
          }

       --new-name (string)
          The  new  name  for  the modified DBProxyTarget . An identifier must
          begin with a letter and must contain only ASCII letters, digits, and
          hyphens;  it  can't  end  with  a  hyphen or contain two consecutive
          hyphens.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DBProxyTargetGroup -> (structure)
          The settings of the modified DBProxyTarget .

          DBProxyName -> (string)
              The identifier for the RDS proxy  associated  with  this  target
              group.

          TargetGroupName -> (string)
              The  identifier  for  the target group. This name must be unique
              for all target groups owned by your Amazon Web Services  account
              in the specified Amazon Web Services Region.

          TargetGroupArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) representing the target group.

          IsDefault -> (boolean)
              Whether  this  target group is the first one used for connection
              requests by the associated proxy. Because  each  proxy  is  cur-
              rently  associated  with  a  single target group, currently this
              setting is always true .

          Status -> (string)
              The current status of this target group. A status  of  available
              means  the target group is correctly associated with a database.
              Other values indicate that you must wait for the target group to
              be ready, or take some action to resolve an issue.

          ConnectionPoolConfig -> (structure)
              The settings that determine the size and behavior of the connec-
              tion pool for the target group.

              MaxConnectionsPercent -> (integer)
                 The maximum size of the connection pool for each target in  a
                 target  group.  The value is expressed as a percentage of the
                 max_connections setting for the RDS DB instance or Aurora  DB
                 cluster used by the target group.

              MaxIdleConnectionsPercent -> (integer)
                 Controls  how actively the proxy closes idle database connec-
                 tions in the connection pool. The value  is  expressed  as  a
                 percentage  of  the  max_connections  setting  for the RDS DB
                 instance or Aurora DB cluster used by the target group.  With
                 a  high  value,  the  proxy  leaves a high percentage of idle
                 database connections open. A low value causes  the  proxy  to
                 close  more idle connections and return them to the database.

              ConnectionBorrowTimeout -> (integer)
                 The number of seconds for a proxy to wait for a connection to
                 become  available  in  the connection pool. Only applies when
                 the proxy has opened its maximum number  of  connections  and
                 all connections are busy with client sessions.

              SessionPinningFilters -> (list)
                 Each  item  in  the list represents a class of SQL operations
                 that normally cause all later statements in a session using a
                 proxy  to  be  pinned to the same underlying database connec-
                 tion. Including an item in the list exempts that class of SQL
                 operations  from  the  pinning  behavior. Currently, the only
                 allowed value is EXCLUDE_VARIABLE_SETS .

                 (string)

              InitQuery -> (string)
                 One or more SQL statements for the proxy to run when  opening
                 each  new database connection. Typically used with SET state-
                 ments to make sure that each connection  has  identical  set-
                 tings  such  as  time zone and character set. This setting is
                 empty by default. For multiple statements, use semicolons  as
                 the  separator.  You can also include multiple variables in a
                 single SET statement, such as SET x=1, y=2 .

          CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the target group was first created.

          UpdatedDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the target group was last updated.
