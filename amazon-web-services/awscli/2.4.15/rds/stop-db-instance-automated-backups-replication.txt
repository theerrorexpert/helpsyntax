STOP-DB-INSTANCE-AUTOMATED-BACSTOP-DB-INSTANCE-AUTOMATED-BACKUPS-REPLICATION()



NAME
       stop-db-instance-automated-backups-replication -

DESCRIPTION
       Stops automated backup replication for a DB instance.

       This command doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       For more information, see Replicating Automated Backups to Another Ama-
       zon Web Services Region in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            stop-db-instance-automated-backups-replication
          --source-db-instance-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-db-instance-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source DB instance  for  which
          to    stop    replicating    automated    backups,    for   example,
          arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:db:mydatabase .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To stop replicating automated backups

       The   following   stop-db-instance-automated-backups-replication   ends
       replication of automated backups to the US West (Oregon) Region. Repli-
       cated backups are  retained  according  to  the  set  backup  retention
       period.

          aws rds stop-db-instance-automated-backups-replication \
              --region us-west-2 \
              --source-db-instance-arn "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:db:new-orcl-db"
