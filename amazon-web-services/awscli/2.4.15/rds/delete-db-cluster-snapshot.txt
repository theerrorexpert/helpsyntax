DELETE-DB-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOT()                      DELETE-DB-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       delete-db-cluster-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  DB  cluster  snapshot. If the snapshot is being copied, the
       copy operation is terminated.

       NOTE:
          The DB cluster snapshot  must  be  in  the  available  state  to  be
          deleted.

       For  more  information  on Amazon Aurora, see What is Amazon Aurora? in
       the Amazon Aurora User Guide.

       For more information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see Multi-AZ  deployments
       with two readable standby DB instances in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

       NOTE:
          The  Multi-AZ  DB  clusters  feature is in preview and is subject to
          change.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-db-cluster-snapshot
          --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the DB cluster snapshot to delete.

          Constraints: Must be the name of an existing DB cluster snapshot  in
          the available state.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a DB cluster snapshot

       The  following delete-db-cluster-snapshot example deletes the specified
       DB cluster snapshot.

          aws rds delete-db-cluster-snapshot \
              --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier mydbclustersnapshot
