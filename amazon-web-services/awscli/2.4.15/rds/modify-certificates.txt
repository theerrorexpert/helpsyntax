MODIFY-CERTIFICATES()                                    MODIFY-CERTIFICATES()



NAME
       modify-certificates -

DESCRIPTION
       Override  the system-default Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Secu-
       rity (SSL/TLS) certificate for Amazon RDS for new DB  instances  tempo-
       rarily, or remove the override.

       By  using  this operation, you can specify an RDS-approved SSL/TLS cer-
       tificate for new DB instances that is different from the  default  cer-
       tificate provided by RDS. You can also use this operation to remove the
       override, so that new DB instances use the default certificate provided
       by RDS.

       You  might  need  to  override the default certificate in the following
       situations:

       o You already migrated your applications to support the latest certifi-
         cate  authority  (CA)  certificate, but the new CA certificate is not
         yet the RDS default CA certificate for the specified Amazon Web  Ser-
         vices Region.

       o RDS  has already moved to a new default CA certificate for the speci-
         fied Amazon Web Services Region, but you are still in the process  of
         supporting the new CA certificate. In this case, you temporarily need
         additional time to finish your application changes.

       engines,  see  Rotating Your SSL/TLS Certificate in the Amazon RDS User
       Guide .

       DB  engines, see Rotating Your SSL/TLS Certificate in the Amazon Aurora
       User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            modify-certificates
          [--certificate-identifier <value>]
          [--remove-customer-override | --no-remove-customer-override]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-identifier (string)
          The new default certificate identifier to override the  current  one
          with.

          To  determine  the  valid  values, use the describe-certificates CLI
          command or the DescribeCertificates API operation.

       --remove-customer-override | --no-remove-customer-override (boolean)
          A value that indicates  whether  to  remove  the  override  for  the
          default  certificate.  If  the override is removed, the default cer-
          tificate is the system default.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To temporarily override the system-default SSL/TLS certificate for  new
       DB instances

       The  following  modify-certificates  example  temporarily overrides the
       system-default SSL/TLS certificate for new DB instances.

          aws rds modify-certificates \
              --certificate-identifier rds-ca-2019
