       --auto-minor-version-upgrade     |      --no-auto-minor-version-upgrade
       (boolean)
          A  value  that  indicates  whether minor engine upgrades are applied
          automatically to the DB instance during the maintenance  window.  By
          default, minor engine upgrades are applied automatically.

          If  you create an RDS Custom DB instance, you must set AutoMinorVer-
          sionUpgrade to false .

       --license-model (string)
          License model information for this DB instance.

          Valid  values:  license-included  |  bring-your-own-license  |  gen-
          eral-public-license

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --iops (integer)
          The  amount of Provisioned IOPS (input/output operations per second)
          to be initially allocated for the DB instance. For information about
          valid  Iops  values,  see  Amazon  RDS  Provisioned  IOPS storage to
          improve performance in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          Constraints:  For  MariaDB,  MySQL,  Oracle,   and   PostgreSQL   DB
          instances,  must  be  a  multiple  between  .5 and 50 of the storage
          amount for the DB instance. For SQL Server DB instances, must  be  a
          multiple between 1 and 50 of the storage amount for the DB instance.

       --option-group-name (string)
          A value that indicates that the DB  instance  should  be  associated
          with the specified option group.

          Permanent  options, such as the TDE option for Oracle Advanced Secu-
          rity TDE, can't be removed from an option group. Also,  that  option
          group  can't  be  removed  from a DB instance after it is associated
          with a DB instance.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --character-set-name (string)
          For supported engines, this value indicates  that  the  DB  instance
          should be associated with the specified CharacterSet .

          This  setting  doesn't  apply to RDS Custom. However, if you need to
          change the character set, you can change it on the database  itself.
              Amazon Aurora

          Not  applicable. The character set is managed by the DB cluster. For
          more information, see CreateDBCluster .

       --nchar-character-set-name (string)
          The name of the NCHAR character set for the Oracle DB instance.

          This parameter doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --publicly-accessible | --no-publicly-accessible (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether the DB instance is publicly  accessi-
          ble.

          When  the DB instance is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System
          (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB
          instance's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP
          address from outside of the DB instance's  VPC.  Access  to  the  DB
          instance  is  ultimately  controlled  by the security group it uses.
          That public access is not permitted if the security  group  assigned
          to the DB instance doesn't permit it.

          When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB
          instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

          Default: The default behavior varies depending on whether  DBSubnet-
          GroupName is specified.

          If  DBSubnetGroupName  isn't specified, and PubliclyAccessible isn't
          specified, the following applies:

          o If the default VPC in the target Region doesnt  have  an  internet
            gateway attached to it, the DB instance is private.

          o If  the  default  VPC in the target Region has an internet gateway
            attached to it, the DB instance is public.

          If DBSubnetGroupName  is  specified,  and  PubliclyAccessible  isn't
          specified, the following applies:

          o If  the  subnets  are  part  of a VPC that doesnt have an internet
            gateway attached to it, the DB instance is private.

          o If the subnets are part of a VPC  that  has  an  internet  gateway
            attached to it, the DB instance is public.

       --tags (list)
          Tags to assign to the DB instance.

          (structure)
              Metadata  assigned  to  an  Amazon  RDS resource consisting of a
              key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 A key is the required name of the tag. The string  value  can
                 be  from  1  to 128 Unicode characters in length and can't be
                 prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain only
                 the  set  of  Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_', '.',
                 ':',   '/',    '=',    '+',    '-',    '@'    (Java    regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A  value  is  the optional value of the tag. The string value
                 can be from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length  and  can't
                 be  prefixed  with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain
                 only the set of Unicode letters,  digits,  white-space,  '_',
                 '.',   ':',   '/',   '=',   '+',   '-',   '@'   (Java  regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

          Specifies the storage type to be associated with the DB instance.

          Valid values: standard | gp2 | io1

          If you specify io1 , you must also include  a  value  for  the  Iops
          parameter.

          Default: io1 if the Iops parameter is specified, otherwise gp2

       --tde-credential-arn (string)
          The  ARN from the key store with which to associate the instance for
          TDE encryption.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --tde-credential-password (string)
          The password for the given ARN from the key store in order to access
          the device.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --storage-encrypted | --no-storage-encrypted (boolean)
          A  value  that  indicates  whether  the DB instance is encrypted. By
          default, it isn't encrypted.

          For RDS Custom instances, either set this parameter to true or leave
          it unset. If you set this parameter to false , RDS reports an error.
              Amazon Aurora

          Not applicable. The encryption for DB instances is managed by the DB
          cluster.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The  Amazon  Web  Services  KMS  key  identifier for an encrypted DB
          instance.

          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN,  key  ID,
          alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a dif-
          ferent Amazon Web Services account, specify the  key  ARN  or  alias
          ARN.
              Amazon Aurora

          Not  applicable.  The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is man-
          aged by the DB cluster. For more information, see CreateDBCluster  .

          If  StorageEncrypted  is enabled, and you do not specify a value for
          the KmsKeyId parameter, then Amazon RDS uses your default  KMS  key.
          There  is  a  default  KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account.
          Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for
          each Amazon Web Services Region.
              Amazon RDS Custom

          A  KMS  key  is  required  for  RDS  Custom  instances. For most RDS
          engines, if you leave this parameter empty while enabling StorageEn-
          crypted  ,  the engine uses the default KMS key. However, RDS Custom
          doesn't use the default key when this parameter is empty.  You  must
          explicitly specify a key.

       --domain (string)
          The Active Directory directory ID to create the DB instance in. Cur-
          rently, only MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and PostgreSQL  DB
          instances can be created in an Active Directory Domain.

          For  more information, see Kerberos Authentication in the Amazon RDS

       --copy-tags-to-snapshot | --no-copy-tags-to-snapshot (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to copy tags from the DB instance  to
          snapshots of the DB instance. By default, tags are not copied.
              Amazon Aurora

          Not applicable. Copying tags to snapshots is managed by the DB clus-
          ter. Setting this value for an Aurora DB instance has no  effect  on
          the DB cluster setting.

       --monitoring-interval (integer)
          The  interval,  in  seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring
          metrics are collected for the DB instance. To disable collection  of
          Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify 0. The default is 0.

          If  MonitoringRoleArn  is specified, then you must set MonitoringIn-
          terval to a value other than 0.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Valid Values: 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60

       --monitoring-role-arn (string)
          The ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS to send enhanced  monitor-
          ing    metrics    to    Amazon   CloudWatch   Logs.   For   example,
          arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess . For information on creating
          a  monitoring  role, see Setting Up and Enabling Enhanced Monitoring
          in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          If MonitoringInterval is set to a value other than 0, then you  must

       --processor-features (list)
          The  number  of CPU cores and the number of threads per core for the
          DB instance class of the DB instance.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          (structure)
              Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

              To specify the number of CPU cores, use  the  coreCount  feature
              name  for  the  Name parameter. To specify the number of threads
              per core, use the  threadsPerCore  feature  name  for  the  Name
              parameter.

              You  can set the processor features of the DB instance class for
              a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

              o CreateDBInstance

              o ModifyDBInstance

              o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

              o RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

              o RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime

              You can  view  the  valid  processor  values  for  a  particular
              instance class by calling the DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions
              action and specifying the instance class for the DBInstanceClass
              parameter.

              In  addition,  you can use the following actions for DB instance
              class processor information:

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribeDBSnapshots

              o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

              If  you  call  DescribeDBInstances  ,  ProcessorFeature  returns
              non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

              o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

              o Your  Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the number
                of CPU cores and threads per core.

              o The  current  number  CPU  cores  and  threads  is  set  to  a
                non-default value.

          For the list of permissions required for the IAM role, see Configure
          IAM and your VPC in the  Amazon  Relational  Database  Service  User
          Guide .

          This setting is required for RDS Custom.

       --backup-target (string)
          Specifies where automated backups and manual snapshots are stored.

          Possible  values  are  outposts  (Amazon  Web Services Outposts) and
          region (Amazon Web Services Region). The default is region .

          For more information, see Working with Amazon RDS on Amazon Web Ser-
          vices Outposts in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

              ProcessorFeatures -> (list)
                 The number of CPU cores and the number of  threads  per  core
                 for the DB instance class of the DB instance.

                 (structure)
                     Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

                     To  specify  the  number  of CPU cores, use the coreCount
                     feature name for the Name parameter. To specify the  num-
                     ber  of  threads per core, use the threadsPerCore feature
                     name for the Name parameter.

                     You can set the processor features  of  the  DB  instance
                     class  for a DB instance when you call one of the follow-
                     ing actions:

                     o CreateDBInstance

                     o ModifyDBInstance

                     o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

                     o RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

                     o RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime

                     You can view the valid processor values for a  particular
                     instance  class  by  calling  the  DescribeOrderableDBIn-
                     stanceOptions action and specifying  the  instance  class
                     for the DBInstanceClass parameter.

                     In  addition,  you  can  use the following actions for DB
                     instance class processor information:

                     o DescribeDBInstances

                     o DescribeDBSnapshots

                     o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

                     If  you  call  DescribeDBInstances   ,   ProcessorFeature
                     returns  non-null values only if the following conditions
                     are met:

                     o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

                     o Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring  the
                       number of CPU cores and threads per core.

                     o The  current  number  CPU cores and threads is set to a
                       non-default value.

                 The  automation  mode  of the RDS Custom DB instance: full or
                 all-paused . If full , the DB instance  automates  monitoring
                 and  instance  recovery.  If all-paused , the instance pauses
                 automation for  the  duration  set  by  --resume-full-automa-
                 tion-mode-minutes .

              ResumeFullAutomationModeTime -> (timestamp)

              When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name Sys-
              tem  (DNS)  endpoint  resolves  to  the  private IP address from
              within the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves
              to  the  public IP address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC.
              Access to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by  the  secu-
              rity  group  it  uses. That public access isn't permitted if the
              security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it.

              When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an  inter-
              nal  DB  instance  with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP
              address.

              For more information, see  CreateDBInstance .
