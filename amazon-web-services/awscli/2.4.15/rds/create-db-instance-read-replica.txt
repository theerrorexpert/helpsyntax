NAME
       create-db-instance-read-replica -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new DB instance that acts as a read replica for an existing
       source DB instance. You can create a read replica  for  a  DB  instance
       running  MySQL,  MariaDB,  Oracle,  PostgreSQL, or SQL Server. For more
       information, see Working with Read Replicas  in  the  Amazon  RDS  User
       Guide .

       Amazon  Aurora  doesn't  support this action. Call the CreateDBInstance
       action to create a DB instance for an Aurora DB cluster.

       All read replica DB instances are created with  backups  disabled.  All
       other  DB  instance  attributes  (including  DB  security groups and DB
       parameter groups) are inherited from the source DB instance, except  as
       specified.

       WARNING:
          Your source DB instance must have backup retention enabled.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --db-instance-identifier (string)
          The  DB  instance identifier of the read replica. This identifier is
          the unique key that identifies a  DB  instance.  This  parameter  is
          stored as a lowercase string.

       --source-db-instance-identifier (string)
          The  identifier  of  the DB instance that will act as the source for
          the read replica. Each DB instance can have up to five  read  repli-
          cas.

          Constraints:

          o Must  be  the  identifier  of  an existing MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle,
            PostgreSQL, or SQL Server DB instance.

          o Can specify a DB instance that is a MySQL read replica only if the
            source is running MySQL 5.6 or later.

          o For the limitations of Oracle read replicas, see Read Replica Lim-
            itations with Oracle in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          o For the limitations of SQL Server read replicas, see Read  Replica
            Limitations with Microsoft SQL Server in the Amazon RDS User Guide
            .

          o Can specify a PostgreSQL DB instance only if the source is running
            PostgreSQL  9.3.5  or  later  (9.4.7  and  higher for cross-Region
            replication).

          o The specified DB instance must  have  automatic  backups  enabled,
            that is, its backup retention period must be greater than 0.

          o If  the  source  DB  instance  is  in the same Amazon Web Services
            Region as the read replica, specify a valid  DB  instance  identi-
            fier.

          o If  the  source  DB instance is in a different Amazon Web Services
            Region from the read replica, specify a valid DB instance ARN. For
            more  information,  see  Constructing an ARN for Amazon RDS in the
            Amazon RDS User Guide . This doesn't apply to SQL  Server  or  RDS
            Custom, which don't support cross-Region replicas.

       --db-instance-class (string)
          The  compute  and  memory  capacity of the read replica, for example
          db.m4.large. Not all DB instance classes are available in all Amazon
          Web Services Regions, or for all database engines. For the full list
          of DB instance classes, and availability for  your  engine,  see  DB
          Instance Class in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

          Default: Inherits from the source DB instance.

       --availability-zone (string)
          The Availability Zone (AZ) where the read replica will be created.

          Default: A random, system-chosen Availability Zone in the endpoint's
          Amazon Web Services Region.

          Example: us-east-1d

       --port (integer)
          The port number that the DB instance uses for connections.

          Default: Inherits from the source DB instance

          Valid Values: 1150-65535

       --multi-az | --no-multi-az (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether the read replica  is  in  a  Multi-AZ
          deployment.

          You can create a read replica as a Multi-AZ DB instance. RDS creates
          a standby of your replica in another Availability Zone for  failover
          support for the replica. Creating your read replica as a Multi-AZ DB
          instance is independent of whether the source database is a Multi-AZ
          DB instance.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --auto-minor-version-upgrade      |     --no-auto-minor-version-upgrade
       (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether minor  engine  upgrades  are  applied
          automatically to the read replica during the maintenance window.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Default: Inherits from the source DB instance

       --iops (integer)
          The  amount of Provisioned IOPS (input/output operations per second)
          to be initially allocated for the DB instance.

       --option-group-name (string)
          The option group the DB instance is associated with. If omitted, the
          option group associated with the source instance is used.

          NOTE:
              For  SQL  Server,  you must use the option group associated with
              the source instance.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --db-parameter-group-name (string)
          The name of the  DB  parameter  group  to  associate  with  this  DB
          instance.

          If you do not specify a value for DBParameterGroupName , then Amazon
          RDS uses the DBParameterGroup of  source  DB  instance  for  a  same
          Region  read replica, or the default DBParameterGroup for the speci-
          fied DB engine for a cross-Region read replica.

          Specifying a parameter group for this operation  is  only  supported
          for Oracle DB instances. It isn't supported for RDS Custom.

          Constraints:

          o Must be 1 to 255 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

          o First character must be a letter

          o Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens

       --publicly-accessible | --no-publicly-accessible (boolean)
          A  value that indicates whether the DB instance is publicly accessi-
          ble.

          When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain  Name  System
          (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB
          cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public  IP
          address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC. Access to the DB clus-
          ter is ultimately controlled by the security  group  it  uses.  That
          public  access isn't permitted if the security group assigned to the
          DB cluster doesn't permit it.

          When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB
          instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

          For more information, see  CreateDBInstance .

       --tags (list)
          A  list  of  tags.  For  more  information,  see  Tagging Amazon RDS
          Resources in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

          (structure)
              Metadata assigned to an Amazon  RDS  resource  consisting  of  a
              key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 A  key  is the required name of the tag. The string value can
                 be from 1 to 128 Unicode characters in length  and  can't  be
                 prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain only
                 the set of Unicode letters, digits,  white-space,  '_',  '.',
                 ':',    '/',    '=',    '+',    '-',    '@'    (Java   regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A value is the optional value of the tag.  The  string  value
                 can  be  from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length and can't
                 be prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can  only  contain
                 only  the  set  of Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_',
                 '.',  ':',   '/',   '=',   '+',   '-',   '@'   (Java   regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --db-subnet-group-name (string)
          Specifies a DB subnet group for the DB instance. The new DB instance
          is created in the VPC associated with the DB subnet group. If no  DB
          subnet group is specified, then the new DB instance isn't created in
          a VPC.

          Constraints:

          o Can only be specified if the source DB instance identifier  speci-
            fies a DB instance in another Amazon Web Services Region.

          o If supplied, must match the name of an existing DBSubnetGroup.

          o The  specified DB subnet group must be in the same Amazon Web Ser-
            vices Region in which the operation is running.

          o All read replicas in one Amazon Web Services Region that are  cre-
            ated from the same source DB instance must either:>

            o Specify  DB  subnet  groups  from  the  same VPC. All these read
              replicas are created in the same VPC.

            o Not specify a DB subnet group. All these read replicas are  cre-
              ated outside of any VPC.

          Example: mySubnetgroup

       --vpc-security-group-ids (list)
          A  list of Amazon EC2 VPC security groups to associate with the read
          replica.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Default: The default EC2  VPC  security  group  for  the  DB  subnet
          group's VPC.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --storage-type (string)
          Specifies the storage type to be associated with the read replica.

          Valid values: standard | gp2 | io1

          If  you  specify  io1  ,  you must also include a value for the Iops
          parameter.

          Default: io1 if the Iops parameter is specified, otherwise gp2

       --copy-tags-to-snapshot | --no-copy-tags-to-snapshot (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether  to  copy  all  tags  from  the  read
          replica  to  snapshots of the read replica. By default, tags are not
          copied.

       --monitoring-interval (integer)
          The interval, in seconds, between points  when  Enhanced  Monitoring
          metrics  are  collected  for the read replica. To disable collecting
          Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify 0. The default is 0.

          If MonitoringRoleArn is specified, then  you  must  also  set  Moni-
          toringInterval to a value other than 0.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Valid Values: 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60

       --monitoring-role-arn (string)
          The  ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS to send enhanced monitor-
          ing   metrics   to   Amazon   CloudWatch    Logs.    For    example,
          arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess . For information on creating
          a monitoring role, go to To  create  an  IAM  role  for  Amazon  RDS
          Enhanced Monitoring in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          If  MonitoringInterval is set to a value other than 0, then you must
          supply a MonitoringRoleArn value.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier  for  an  encrypted  read
          replica.

          The  Amazon  Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID,
          alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

          If you create an encrypted read replica in the same Amazon Web  Ser-
          vices  Region as the source DB instance, then do not specify a value
          for this parameter. A read replica in the same Amazon  Web  Services
          Region  is  always  encrypted with the same KMS key as the source DB
          instance.

          If you create an encrypted read replica in a  different  Amazon  Web
          Services  Region, then you must specify a KMS key identifier for the
          destination Amazon Web Services Region. KMS keys are specific to the
          Amazon  Web  Services Region that they are created in, and you can't
          use KMS keys from one Amazon Web Services Region in  another  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

          You  can't  create  an encrypted read replica from an unencrypted DB
          instance.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom, which uses  the  same  KMS
          key as the primary replica.

       --pre-signed-url (string)
          The  URL  that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the
          CreateDBInstanceReadReplica API action in the source Amazon Web Ser-
          vices Region that contains the source DB instance.

          You  must  specify  this parameter when you create an encrypted read
          replica from another Amazon Web Services Region by using the  Amazon
          RDS  API.  Don't  specify  PreSignedUrl  when  you  are  creating an
          encrypted read replica in the same Amazon Web Services Region.

          The presigned URL must  be  a  valid  request  for  the  CreateDBIn-
          stanceReadReplica API action that can be executed in the source Ama-
          zon Web Services  Region  that  contains  the  encrypted  source  DB
          instance.  The  presigned  URL  request  must  contain the following
          parameter values:

          o DestinationRegion -  The  Amazon  Web  Services  Region  that  the
            encrypted  read  replica  is  created in. This Amazon Web Services
            Region is  the  same  one  where  the  CreateDBInstanceReadReplica
            action is called that contains this presigned URL. For example, if
            you create an encrypted DB instance in the  us-west-1  Amazon  Web
            Services Region, from a source DB instance in the us-east-2 Amazon
            Web Services Region, then you call the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica
            action  in  the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region and provide a
            presigned URL that contains a call  to  the  CreateDBInstanceRead-
            Replica  action  in  the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region. For
            this example, the DestinationRegion in the presigned URL  must  be
            set to the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region.

          o KmsKeyId  - The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for the key
            to use to encrypt the read replica in the destination  Amazon  Web
            Services Region. This is the same identifier for both the CreateD-
            BInstanceReadReplica action that is called in the destination Ama-
            zon Web Services Region, and the action contained in the presigned
            URL.

          o SourceDBInstanceIdentifier - The DB instance  identifier  for  the
            encrypted DB instance to be replicated. This identifier must be in
            the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the  source  Amazon  Web
            Services  Region.  For  example,  if you are creating an encrypted
            read replica from a DB instance in the us-west-2 Amazon  Web  Ser-
            vices  Region, then your SourceDBInstanceIdentifier looks like the
            following                                                 example:
            arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:instance:mysql-instance1-20161115
            .

          To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed  request,  see
          Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services
          Signature Version 4) and Signature Version 4 Signing Process .

          NOTE:
              If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you
              can  specify  SourceRegion  (or  --source-region  for  the  CLI)
              instead  of   specifying   PreSignedUrl   manually.   Specifying
              SourceRegion  autogenerates  a  presigned  URL  that  is a valid
              request for the operation that can be  executed  in  the  source
              Amazon Web Services Region.
                 SourceRegion  isn't  supported  for  SQL  Server, because SQL
                 Server on Amazon RDS doesn't support cross-Region read repli-
                 cas.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --enable-iam-database-authentication | --no-enable-iam-database-authen-
       tication (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to enable mapping of Amazon Web  Ser-
          vices  Identity  and  Access  Management  (IAM) accounts to database
          accounts. By default, mapping isn't enabled.

          For more information about  IAM  database  authentication,  see  IAM
          Database  Authentication  for MySQL and PostgreSQL in the Amazon RDS
          User Guide.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --enable-performance-insights    |     --no-enable-performance-insights
       (boolean)
          A  value  that  indicates whether to enable Performance Insights for
          the read replica.

          For more information, see Using Amazon Performance Insights  in  the
          Amazon RDS User Guide .

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --performance-insights-kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for encryption of Perfor-
          mance Insights data.

          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN,  key  ID,
          alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

          If you do not specify a value for PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId , then
          Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for
          your  Amazon  Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account
          has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --performance-insights-retention-period (integer)
          The  amount  of  time, in days, to retain Performance Insights data.
          Valid values are 7 or 731 (2 years).

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --processor-features (list)
          The  number  of CPU cores and the number of threads per core for the
          DB instance class of the DB instance.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          (structure)
              Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

              To specify the number of CPU cores, use  the  coreCount  feature
              name  for  the  Name parameter. To specify the number of threads
              per core, use the  threadsPerCore  feature  name  for  the  Name
              parameter.

              You  can set the processor features of the DB instance class for
              a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

              o CreateDBInstance

              o ModifyDBInstance

              o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

              o RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

              o RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime

              You can  view  the  valid  processor  values  for  a  particular
              instance class by calling the DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions
              action and specifying the instance class for the DBInstanceClass
              parameter.

              In  addition,  you can use the following actions for DB instance
              class processor information:

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribeDBSnapshots

              o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

              If  you  call  DescribeDBInstances  ,  ProcessorFeature  returns
              non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

              o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

              o Your  Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the number
                of CPU cores and threads per core.

              o The  current  number  CPU  cores  and  threads  is  set  to  a
                non-default value.

              For  more  information,  see Configuring the Processor of the DB
              Instance Class in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the processor feature. Valid names are  coreCount
                 and threadsPerCore .

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of a processor feature name.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --use-default-processor-features  | --no-use-default-processor-features
       (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether the  DB  instance  class  of  the  DB
          instance uses its default processor features.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          A  value that indicates whether the DB instance has deletion protec-
          tion enabled. The database can't be deleted when deletion protection
          is  enabled. By default, deletion protection isn't enabled. For more
          information, see Deleting a DB Instance .

       --domain (string)
          The Active Directory directory ID to create the DB instance in. Cur-
          rently,  only MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and PostgreSQL DB
          instances can be created in an Active Directory Domain.

          For more information, see Kerberos Authentication in the Amazon  RDS
          User Guide .

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --domain-iam-role-name (string)
          Specify the name of the IAM role to be used when making API calls to
          the Directory Service.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --replica-mode (string)
          The open mode of the replica database: mounted or read-only.

          NOTE:
              This parameter is only supported for Oracle DB instances.

          Mounted DB replicas are included in Oracle Database Enterprise  Edi-
          tion.  The main use case for mounted replicas is cross-Region disas-
          ter recovery. The primary database doesn't use Active Data Guard  to
          transmit  information  to  the  mounted  replica. Because it doesn't
          accept user connections, a mounted replica can't serve  a  read-only
          workload.

          You  can  create  a combination of mounted and read-only DB replicas
          for the same primary DB instance. For more information, see  Working
          with  Oracle  Read  Replicas  for  Amazon RDS in the Amazon RDS User
          Guide .

          For RDS Custom, you must  specify  this  parameter  and  set  it  to
          mounted . The value won't be set by default. After replica creation,
          you can manage the open mode manually.

          Possible values:

          o open-read-only

          o mounted

       --max-allocated-storage (integer)
          The upper limit in gibibytes (GiB) to which Amazon RDS can automati-
          cally scale the storage of the DB instance.

          For  more information about this setting, including limitations that
          apply to it, see Managing capacity  automatically  with  Amazon  RDS
          storage autoscaling in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

       --custom-iam-instance-profile (string)
          The  instance  profile  associated  with  the  underlying Amazon EC2
          instance of an RDS Custom DB instance.  The  instance  profile  must
          meet the following requirements:

          o The profile must exist in your account.

          o The  profile must have an IAM role that Amazon EC2 has permissions
            to assume.

          o The instance profile name and the associated IAM  role  name  must
            start with the prefix AWSRDSCustom .

          For the list of permissions required for the IAM role, see Configure
          IAM and your VPC in the  Amazon  Relational  Database  Service  User
          Guide .

          This setting is required for RDS Custom.

       --source-region (string)
          The  ID of the region that contains the source for the read replica.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 (structure)
                     Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

                     To  specify  the  number  of CPU cores, use the coreCount
                     feature name for the Name parameter. To specify the  num-
                     ber  of  threads per core, use the threadsPerCore feature
                     name for the Name parameter.

                     You can set the processor features  of  the  DB  instance
                     class  for a DB instance when you call one of the follow-
                     ing actions:

                     o CreateDBInstance

                     o ModifyDBInstance

                     o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

                     o RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

                     o RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime

                     You can view the valid processor values for a  particular
                     instance  class  by  calling  the  DescribeOrderableDBIn-
                     stanceOptions action and specifying  the  instance  class
                     for the DBInstanceClass parameter.

                     In  addition,  you  can  use the following actions for DB
                     instance class processor information:

                     o DescribeDBInstances

                     o DescribeDBSnapshots

                     o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

                     If  you  call  DescribeDBInstances   ,   ProcessorFeature
                     returns  non-null values only if the following conditions
                     are met:

                     o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

                     o Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring  the
                       number of CPU cores and threads per core.

                     o The  current  number  CPU cores and threads is set to a
                       non-default value.

              When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name Sys-
              tem  (DNS)  endpoint  resolves  to  the  private IP address from
              within the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves
              to  the  public IP address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC.
              Access to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by  the  secu-
              rity  group  it  uses. That public access isn't permitted if the
              security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it.

              When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an  inter-
              nal  DB  instance  with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP
              address.

              your  Outpost subnets through your on-premises network. For some
              use cases, a CoIP can provide lower latency for  connections  to
              the  DB instance from outside of its virtual private cloud (VPC)
              on your local network.

              For more information about RDS on  Outposts,  see  Working  with
              Amazon  RDS  on  Amazon  Web Services Outposts in the Amazon RDS
              User Guide .
