DELETE-DB-CLUSTER-ENDPOINT()                      DELETE-DB-CLUSTER-ENDPOINT()



NAME
       delete-db-cluster-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a custom endpoint and removes it from an Amazon Aurora DB clus-
       ter.

       NOTE:
          This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-db-cluster-endpoint
          --db-cluster-endpoint-identifier <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-endpoint-identifier (string)
          The identifier associated with the custom endpoint.  This  parameter
          is stored as a lowercase string.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a custom DB cluster endpoint

       The  following delete-db-cluster-endpoint example deletes the specified
       custom DB cluster endpoint.

          aws rds delete-db-cluster-endpoint \
              --db-cluster-endpoint-identifier mycustomendpoint

       Output:

          {
              "DBClusterEndpointIdentifier": "mycustomendpoint",
              "DBClusterIdentifier": "mydbcluster",
              "DBClusterEndpointResourceIdentifier": "cluster-endpoint-ANPAJ4AE5446DAEXAMPLE",
              "Endpoint": "mycustomendpoint.cluster-custom-cnpexample.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
              "Status": "deleting",
              "EndpointType": "CUSTOM",
              "CustomEndpointType": "READER",
              "StaticMembers": [
                  "dbinstance1",
                  "dbinstance2",
                  "dbinstance3"
              ],
              "ExcludedMembers": [],
              "DBClusterEndpointArn": "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:cluster-endpoint:mycustomendpoint"
          }

OUTPUT
       DBClusterEndpointIdentifier -> (string)
          The  identifier  associated  with  the  endpoint.  This parameter is
          stored as a lowercase string.

       DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
          The DB cluster identifier of the DB cluster associated with the end-
          point. This parameter is stored as a lowercase string.

       DBClusterEndpointResourceIdentifier -> (string)
          A unique system-generated identifier for an endpoint. It remains the
          same for the whole life of the endpoint.

       Endpoint -> (string)
          The DNS address of the endpoint.

       Status -> (string)
          The current status of the endpoint. One of: creating ,  available  ,
          deleting  ,  inactive , modifying . The inactive state applies to an
          endpoint that can't be used for a certain kind of cluster, such as a
          writer  endpoint for a read-only secondary cluster in a global data-
          base.

       EndpointType -> (string)
          The type of the endpoint. One of: READER , WRITER , CUSTOM .

       CustomEndpointType -> (string)
          The type associated with a custom endpoint. One of: READER ,  WRITER
          , ANY .

       StaticMembers -> (list)
          List of DB instance identifiers that are part of the custom endpoint
          group.

          (string)

       ExcludedMembers -> (list)
          List of DB instance identifiers that aren't part of the custom  end-
          point  group. All other eligible instances are reachable through the
          custom endpoint. Only relevant if the  list  of  static  members  is
          empty.

          (string)

       DBClusterEndpointArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the endpoint.
