DELETE-GLOBAL-CLUSTER()                                DELETE-GLOBAL-CLUSTER()



NAME
       delete-global-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  global database cluster. The primary and secondary clusters
       must already be detached or destroyed first.

       NOTE:
          This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-global-cluster
          --global-cluster-identifier <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-cluster-identifier (string)
          The cluster identifier of the global database cluster being deleted.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a global DB cluster

       The   following   delete-global-cluster   example   deletes  an  Aurora
       MySQL-compatible global DB cluster. The output shows the  cluster  that
       you're deleting, but subsequent describe-global-clusters commands don't
       list that DB cluster.

          aws rds delete-global-cluster \
              --global-cluster-identifier myglobalcluster

       Output:

          {
              "GlobalCluster": {
                  "GlobalClusterIdentifier": "myglobalcluster",
                  "GlobalClusterResourceId": "cluster-f0e523bfe07aabb",
                  "GlobalClusterArn": "arn:aws:rds::123456789012:global-cluster:myglobalcluster",
                  "Status": "available",
                  "Engine": "aurora-mysql",
                  "EngineVersion": "5.7.mysql_aurora.2.07.2",
                  "StorageEncrypted": false,

              }
          }

              The  Aurora database engine used by the global database cluster.

          EngineVersion -> (string)
              Indicates the database engine version.

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              The default database name within the new global  database  clus-
              ter.

              The  storage encryption setting for the global database cluster.

          DeletionProtection -> (boolean)
              The deletion protection setting  for  the  new  global  database
              cluster.

              The list of cluster IDs for secondary clusters within the global

                 A data structure with information about any primary and  sec-
                 ondary clusters associated with an Aurora global database.

                 DBClusterArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for each Aurora cluster.

                     ter (that is, has read-write capability) for  the  Aurora
                     global database with which it is associated.

                 GlobalWriteForwardingStatus -> (string)
                     Specifies whether a secondary cluster in an Aurora global
                     database has write forwarding enabled, not enabled, or is

              API operation has been called on this Aurora global  database  (
              GlobalCluster ).

              Status -> (string)

                 o pending  A request to fail over the Aurora global  database
                   (  GlobalCluster  )  has  been received by the service. The
                   GlobalCluster 's primary DB cluster and the specified  sec-
                   ondary  DB  cluster  are being verified before the failover
                   process can start.

                 o failing-over  This status covers the range of Aurora inter-
                   nal operations that take place during the failover process,
                   such as demoting the primary Aurora DB  cluster,  promoting
                   the secondary Aurora DB, and synchronizing replicas.

                 o cancelling   The  request  to  fail  over the Aurora global
                   database ( GlobalCluster ) was cancelled  and  the  primary
                   Aurora  DB  cluster  and  the  selected secondary Aurora DB
                   cluster are returning to their previous states.

                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Aurora DB cluster  that
                 is currently being demoted, and which is associated with this

              ToDbClusterArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Aurora DB cluster  that
                 is  currently  being  promoted,  and which is associated with
                 this state.
