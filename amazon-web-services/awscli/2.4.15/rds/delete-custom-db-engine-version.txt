DELETE-CUSTOM-DB-ENGINE-VERSION()            DELETE-CUSTOM-DB-ENGINE-VERSION()



NAME
       delete-custom-db-engine-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  custom  engine  version. To run this command, make sure you
       meet the following prerequisites:

       o The CEV must not be the default for RDS Custom. If it is, change  the
         default before running this command.

       o The  CEV  must  not be associated with an RDS Custom DB instance, RDS
         Custom instance snapshot, or automated  backup  of  your  RDS  Custom
         instance.

       Typically, deletion takes a few minutes.

       NOTE:
          The  MediaImport service that imports files from Amazon S3 to create
          CEVs isn't integrated with Amazon Web Services  CloudTrail.  If  you
          turn  on  data  logging  for  Amazon RDS in CloudTrail, calls to the
          DeleteCustomDbEngineVersion event aren't logged. However, you  might
          see  calls from the API gateway that accesses your Amazon S3 bucket.
          These calls originate from the MediaImport service for  the  Delete-
          CustomDbEngineVersion event.

       For more information, see Deleting a CEV in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            delete-custom-db-engine-version
          --engine <value>
          --engine-version <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --engine (string)
          The database engine. The only supported engine is custom-oracle-ee .

       --engine-version (string)
          The custom engine version (CEV) for your DB instance. This option is
          required for RDS Custom, but optional for Amazon RDS.  The  combina-
          tion  of  Engine and EngineVersion is unique per customer per Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
