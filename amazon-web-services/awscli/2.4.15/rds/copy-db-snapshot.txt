COPY-DB-SNAPSHOT()                                          COPY-DB-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       copy-db-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Copies the specified DB snapshot. The source DB snapshot must be in the
       available state.

       You can copy a snapshot from one Amazon Web Services Region to another.
       In that case, the Amazon Web Services Region where you call the CopyDB-
       Snapshot action is the destination Amazon Web Services Region  for  the
       DB snapshot copy.

       This command doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       For more information about copying snapshots, see Copying a DB Snapshot
       in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          --source-db-snapshot-identifier <value>
          --target-db-snapshot-identifier <value>
          [--kms-key-id <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--copy-tags | --no-copy-tags]
          [--pre-signed-url <value>]
          [--option-group-name <value>]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-db-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier for the source DB snapshot.

          If the source snapshot is in the same Amazon Web Services Region  as
          the  copy,  specify a valid DB snapshot identifier. For example, you
          might specify rds:mysql-instance1-snapshot-20130805 .

          If the source snapshot is in a different Amazon Web Services  Region
          than  the  copy,  specify  a valid DB snapshot ARN. For example, you
          might        specify        arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:snap-
          shot:mysql-instance1-snapshot-20130805 .

          If  you are copying from a shared manual DB snapshot, this parameter
          must be the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the shared DB snapshot.

          If you are copying an encrypted snapshot this parameter must  be  in
          the  ARN  format for the source Amazon Web Services Region, and must
          match the SourceDBSnapshotIdentifier in the PreSignedUrl  parameter.

          Constraints:

          o Must specify a valid system snapshot in the "available" state.

          Example: rds:mydb-2012-04-02-00-01

          Example:                    arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:snap-
          shot:mysql-instance1-snapshot-20130805

       --target-db-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier for the copy of the snapshot.

          Constraints:

          o Can't be null, empty, or blank

          o Must contain from 1 to 255 letters, numbers, or hyphens

          o First character must be a letter

          o Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens

          Example: my-db-snapshot

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for an encrypted DB snap-
          shot. The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key
          ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

          If you copy an encrypted DB snapshot from your Amazon  Web  Services
          account,  you  can specify a value for this parameter to encrypt the
          copy with a new KMS key. If you  don't  specify  a  value  for  this
          parameter,  then  the  copy of the DB snapshot is encrypted with the
          same Amazon Web Services KMS key as the source DB snapshot.

          If you copy an encrypted DB snapshot that  is  shared  from  another
          Amazon  Web Services account, then you must specify a value for this
          parameter.

          If you specify this parameter when you copy an unencrypted snapshot,
          the copy is encrypted.

          If you copy an encrypted snapshot to a different Amazon Web Services
          Region, then you must specify an Amazon Web Services KMS key identi-
          fier  for  the  destination Amazon Web Services Region. KMS keys are
          specific to the Amazon Web Services Region that they are created in,
          and  you  can't  use KMS keys from one Amazon Web Services Region in
          another Amazon Web Services Region.

       --tags (list)
          A list of  tags.  For  more  information,  see  Tagging  Amazon  RDS
          Resources in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

          (structure)
              Metadata  assigned  to  an  Amazon  RDS resource consisting of a
              key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 A key is the required name of the tag. The string  value  can
                 be  from  1  to 128 Unicode characters in length and can't be
                 prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain only
                 the  set  of  Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_', '.',
                 ':',   '/',    '=',    '+',    '-',    '@'    (Java    regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A  value  is  the optional value of the tag. The string value
                 can be from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length  and  can't
                 be  prefixed  with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain
                 only the set of Unicode letters,  digits,  white-space,  '_',
                 '.',   ':',   '/',   '=',   '+',   '-',   '@'   (Java  regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --copy-tags | --no-copy-tags (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to copy all tags from the  source  DB
          snapshot to the target DB snapshot. By default, tags are not copied.

       --pre-signed-url (string)
          The URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request  for  the
          CopyDBSnapshot  API  action in the source Amazon Web Services Region
          that contains the source DB snapshot to copy.

          You must specify this parameter when you copy an encrypted DB  snap-
          shot from another Amazon Web Services Region by using the Amazon RDS
          API. Don't specify PreSignedUrl when you are copying an encrypted DB
          snapshot in the same Amazon Web Services Region.

          The presigned URL must be a valid request for the CopyDBSnapshot API
          action that can be executed in the source Amazon Web Services Region
          that  contains the encrypted DB snapshot to be copied. The presigned
          URL request must contain the following parameter values:

          o DestinationRegion -  The  Amazon  Web  Services  Region  that  the
            encrypted  DB  snapshot  is  copied  to.  This Amazon Web Services
            Region is the same one where the CopyDBSnapshot action  is  called
            that  contains  this  presigned  URL.  For example, if you copy an
            encrypted DB snapshot  from  the  us-west-2  Amazon  Web  Services
            Region  to the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region, then you call
            the CopyDBSnapshot action in the  us-east-1  Amazon  Web  Services
            Region  and  provide  a  presigned URL that contains a call to the
            CopyDBSnapshot action in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region.
            For  this example, the DestinationRegion in the presigned URL must
            be set to the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region.

          o KmsKeyId - The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for the  KMS
            key  to use to encrypt the copy of the DB snapshot in the destina-
            tion Amazon Web Services Region. This is the same  identifier  for
            both  the  CopyDBSnapshot action that is called in the destination
            Amazon Web Services Region, and the action contained in  the  pre-
            signed URL.

          o SourceDBSnapshotIdentifier  -  The  DB snapshot identifier for the
            encrypted snapshot to be copied. This identifier must  be  in  the
            Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Ser-
            vices Region. For example, if you  are  copying  an  encrypted  DB
            snapshot  from the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your
            SourceDBSnapshotIdentifier  looks  like  the  following   example:
            arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:snapshot:mysql-instance1-snap-
            shot-20161115 .

          To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed  request,  see
          Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services
          Signature Version 4) and Signature Version 4 Signing Process .

          NOTE:
              If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you
              can  specify  SourceRegion  (or  --source-region  for  the  CLI)
              instead  of   specifying   PreSignedUrl   manually.   Specifying
              SourceRegion  autogenerates  a  pre-signed  URL  that is a valid
              request for the operation that can be  executed  in  the  source
              Amazon Web Services Region.

       --option-group-name (string)
          The  name of an option group to associate with the copy of the snap-
          shot.

          Specify this option if you are copying a snapshot  from  one  Amazon
          Web  Services  Region to another, and your DB instance uses a nonde-
          fault option group. If your source DB instance uses Transparent Data
          Encryption for Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server, you must specify this
          option when copying across Amazon Web  Services  Regions.  For  more
          information,  see Option group considerations in the Amazon RDS User
          Guide.

       --target-custom-availability-zone (string)
          The external custom Availability Zone (CAZ) identifier for the  tar-
          get CAZ.

          Example: rds-caz-aiqhTgQv .

       --source-region (string)
          The ID of the region that contains the snapshot to be copied.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

              the  DB  instance  class of the DB instance when the DB snapshot
              was created.

              (structure)
                 Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

                 To specify the number of CPU cores, use the coreCount feature
                 name for the Name parameter. To specify the number of threads
                 per core, use the threadsPerCore feature name  for  the  Name
                 parameter.

                 You  can  set the processor features of the DB instance class
                 for a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

                 o CreateDBInstance

                 o ModifyDBInstance

                 o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

                 o RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

                 o RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime

                 You  can  view  the  valid  processor values for a particular
                 instance class by calling the  DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOp-
                 tions  action and specifying the instance class for the DBIn-
                 stanceClass parameter.

                 In addition,  you  can  use  the  following  actions  for  DB
                 instance class processor information:

                 o DescribeDBInstances

                 o DescribeDBSnapshots

                 o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

                 If  you  call  DescribeDBInstances , ProcessorFeature returns
                 non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

                 o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

                 o Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the num-
