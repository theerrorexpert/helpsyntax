NAME
       describe-db-engine-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of the available DB engines.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-db-engine-versions  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: DBEngineVersions

       --engine-version (string)
          The database engine version to return.

          Example: 5.1.49

       --db-parameter-group-family (string)
          The  name  of a specific DB parameter group family to return details
          for.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match an existing DBParameterGroupFamily.

       --filters (list)
          This parameter isn't currently supported.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              IDs.  The  filters  supported  by a describe operation are docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are  case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --default-only | --no-default-only (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether only the default version of the spec-
          ified engine or engine and major version combination is returned.

       --list-supported-character-sets  |   --no-list-supported-character-sets
       (boolean)
          A  value that indicates whether to list the supported character sets
          for each engine version.

          If this parameter is enabled and the requested engine  supports  the
          CharacterSetName  parameter  for  CreateDBInstance  ,  the  response
          includes a list of supported character sets for each engine version.

          For RDS Custom, the default is not to list supported character sets.
          If you set ListSupportedCharacterSets to true , RDS  Custom  returns
          no results.

       --list-supported-timezones | --no-list-supported-timezones (boolean)
          A  value that indicates whether to list the supported time zones for
          each engine version.

          If this parameter is enabled and the requested engine  supports  the
          TimeZone  parameter  for  CreateDBInstance , the response includes a
          list of supported time zones for each engine version.

          For RDS Custom, the default is not to list supported time zones.  If
          you  set  ListSupportedTimezones  to  true  ,  RDS Custom returns no
          results.

       --include-all | --no-include-all (boolean)
          A value that indicates  whether  to  include  engine  versions  that
          aren't  available in the list. The default is to list only available
          engine versions.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 The supported features vary by DB engine and DB  engine  ver-
                 sion.

                 To  determine the supported features for a specific DB engine
                 and DB engine version using the CLI, use the  following  com-
                 mand:
                     aws      rds     describe-db-engine-versions     --engine
                     <engine_name> --engine-version <engine_version>

                 For example, to determine the supported features for RDS  for
                 PostgreSQL version 13.3 using the CLI, use the following com-
                 mand:
                     aws  rds  describe-db-engine-versions  --engine  postgres
                     --engine-version 13.3

                 The supported features are listed under SupportedFeatureNames
                 in the output.

                 query with a specific DB engine version.

              SupportsGlobalDatabases -> (boolean)
                 A value that indicates whether  you  can  use  Aurora  global
                 databases with a specific DB engine version.

              MajorEngineVersion -> (string)
                 The major engine version of the CEV.

              DatabaseInstallationFilesS3BucketName -> (string)
                 The  name of the Amazon S3 bucket that contains your database
                 installation files.
