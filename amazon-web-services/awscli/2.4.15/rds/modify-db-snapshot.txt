MODIFY-DB-SNAPSHOT()                                      MODIFY-DB-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       modify-db-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  a  manual  DB snapshot with a new engine version. The snapshot
       can be encrypted or unencrypted, but not shared or public.

       Amazon RDS supports upgrading DB snapshots for MySQL,  PostgreSQL,  and
       Oracle. This command doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-db-snapshot
          --db-snapshot-identifier <value>
          [--engine-version <value>]
          [--option-group-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the DB snapshot to modify.

       --engine-version (string)
          The engine version to upgrade the DB snapshot to.

          The  following are the database engines and engine versions that are
          available when you upgrade a DB snapshot.
              MySQL

          o 5.5.46 (supported for 5.1 DB snapshots)
              Oracle

          o 12.1.0.2.v8 (supported for 12.1.0.1 DB snapshots)

          o 11.2.0.4.v12 (supported for 11.2.0.2 DB snapshots)

          o 11.2.0.4.v11 (supported for 11.2.0.3 DB snapshots)
              PostgreSQL

          For the list of engine versions that are available for  upgrading  a
          DB snapshot, see Upgrading the PostgreSQL DB Engine for Amazon RDS .

       --option-group-name (string)
          The option group to identify with the upgraded DB snapshot.

          You can specify this parameter when you upgrade an Oracle  DB  snap-
          shot. The same option group considerations apply when upgrading a DB
          snapshot as when upgrading a DB instance. For more information,  see
          Option group considerations in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To modify a DB snapshot

       The  following  modify-db-snapshot  example  upgrades  a PostgeSQL 10.6
       snapshot named db5-snapshot-upg-test to PostgreSQL  11.7.  The  new  DB
       engine  version  is shown after the snapshot has finished upgrading and
       its status is available.

          aws rds modify-db-snapshot \
              --db-snapshot-identifier db5-snapshot-upg-test \
              --engine-version 11.7

              taken  from  Microsoft SQL Server DB instances that were created
              with a time zone specified.

          IAMDatabaseAuthenticationEnabled -> (boolean)
              True if mapping of Amazon Web Services Identity and Access  Man-
              agement (IAM) accounts to database accounts is enabled, and oth-
              erwise false.

          ProcessorFeatures -> (list)
              The number of CPU cores and the number of threads per  core  for
              the  DB  instance  class of the DB instance when the DB snapshot
              was created.

              (structure)
                 Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

                 To specify the number of CPU cores, use the coreCount feature
                 name for the Name parameter. To specify the number of threads
                 per core, use the threadsPerCore feature name  for  the  Name
                 parameter.

                 You  can  set the processor features of the DB instance class
                 for a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

                 o CreateDBInstance

                 o ModifyDBInstance

                 o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

                 o RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

                 o RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime

                 You  can  view  the  valid  processor values for a particular
                 instance class by calling the  DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOp-
                 tions  action and specifying the instance class for the DBIn-
                 stanceClass parameter.

                 In addition,  you  can  use  the  following  actions  for  DB
                 instance class processor information:

                 o DescribeDBInstances

                 o DescribeDBSnapshots

                 o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

                 If  you  call  DescribeDBInstances , ProcessorFeature returns
                 non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

                 o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

                 o Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the num-
                   ber of CPU cores and threads per core.

                 o The  current  number  CPU  cores  and  threads  is set to a
                   non-default value.

                 For more information, see Configuring the Processor of the DB
                 Instance Class in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The  name of the processor feature. Valid names are core-
                     Count and threadsPerCore .

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value of a processor feature name.

          DbiResourceId -> (string)
              The identifier for  the  source  DB  instance,  which  can't  be
              changed and which is unique to an Amazon Web Services Region.

          TagList -> (list)
              A  list  of  tags.  For more information, see Tagging Amazon RDS
              Resources in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

              (structure)
                 Metadata assigned to an Amazon RDS resource consisting  of  a
                 key-value pair.

                 Key -> (string)
                     A  key  is the required name of the tag. The string value
                     can be from 1 to 128 Unicode  characters  in  length  and
                     can't be prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can only
                     contain  only  the  set  of  Unicode   letters,   digits,
                     white-space, '_', '.', ':', '/', '=', '+', '-', '@' (Java
                     regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

                 Value -> (string)
                     A value is the optional value  of  the  tag.  The  string
                     value  can  be from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length
                     and can't be prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string  can
                     only  contain  only  the  set of Unicode letters, digits,
                     white-space, '_', '.', ':', '/', '=', '+', '-', '@' (Java
                     regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

          OriginalSnapshotCreateTime -> (timestamp)
              Specifies  the time of the CreateDBSnapshot operation in Coordi-
              nated Universal Time (UTC). Doesn't change when the snapshot  is
              copied.

          SnapshotTarget -> (string)
              Specifies where manual snapshots are stored: Amazon Web Services
              Outposts or the Amazon Web Services Region.
