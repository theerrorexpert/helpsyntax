NAME
       modify-db-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  settings  for a DB instance. You can change one or more data-
       base configuration parameters by specifying these  parameters  and  the
       new  values in the request. To learn what modifications you can make to
       your DB instance, call DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications before  you
       call ModifyDBInstance .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --db-instance-identifier (string)
          The  DB  instance  identifier.  This  value is stored as a lowercase
          string.

          Constraints:

          o Must match the identifier of an existing DBInstance.

       --allocated-storage (integer)
          The new amount of storage in gibibytes (GiB) to allocate for the  DB
          instance.

          For  MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL, the value supplied must
          be at least 10% greater than the current value. Values that are  not
          at  least 10% greater than the existing value are rounded up so that
          they are 10% greater than the current value.

          For the valid values for allocated storage for each engine, see Cre-
          ateDBInstance .

       --db-instance-class (string)
          The  new compute and memory capacity of the DB instance, for example
          db.m4.large. Not all DB instance classes are available in all Amazon
          Web Services Regions, or for all database engines. For the full list
          of DB instance classes, and availability for  your  engine,  see  DB
          Instance Class in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          If  you  modify  the  DB instance class, an outage occurs during the
          change. The change is applied during the  next  maintenance  window,
          unless ApplyImmediately is enabled for this request.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom for Oracle.

          Default: Uses existing setting

       --db-subnet-group-name (string)
          The new DB subnet group for the DB instance. You can use this param-
          eter to move your DB  instance  to  a  different  VPC.  If  your  DB
          instance  isn't  in  a  VPC, you can also use this parameter to move
          your DB instance into a VPC. For more information, see Working  with
          a DB instance in a VPC in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          Changing  the  subnet  group causes an outage during the change. The
          change is applied during the next  maintenance  window,  unless  you
          enable ApplyImmediately .

          This parameter doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Constraints:  If supplied, must match the name of an existing DBSub-
          netGroup.

          Example: mySubnetGroup

       --db-security-groups (list)
          A list of DB security groups  to  authorize  on  this  DB  instance.
          Changing  this setting doesn't result in an outage and the change is
          asynchronously applied as soon as possible.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match existing DBSecurityGroups.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --vpc-security-group-ids (list)
          A list of Amazon EC2 VPC security groups to  authorize  on  this  DB
          instance. This change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.
              Amazon Aurora

          Not applicable. The associated list of EC2 VPC  security  groups  is
          managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see ModifyDBCluster
          .

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match existing VpcSecurityGroupIds.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --apply-immediately | --no-apply-immediately (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether the modifications in this request and
          any pending modifications are asynchronously applied as soon as pos-
          sible, regardless of the PreferredMaintenanceWindow setting for  the
          DB instance. By default, this parameter is disabled.

          If  this  parameter  is  disabled,  changes  to  the DB instance are
          applied during the next maintenance window. Some  parameter  changes
          can cause an outage and are applied on the next call to  RebootDBIn-
          stance , or the next failure reboot. Review the table of  parameters
          in  Modifying  a DB Instance in the Amazon RDS User Guide to see the
          impact of enabling or disabling ApplyImmediately for  each  modified
          parameter and to determine when the changes are applied.

       --master-user-password (string)
          The  new  password for the master user. The password can include any
          printable ASCII character except "/", """, or "@".

          Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage and  the  change
          is  asynchronously  applied as soon as possible. Between the time of
          the request and the completion of the request,  the  MasterUserPass-
          word  element  exists  in  the  PendingModifiedValues element of the
          operation response.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.
              Amazon Aurora

          Not applicable. The password for the master user is managed  by  the
          DB cluster. For more information, see ModifyDBCluster .

          Default: Uses existing setting
              MariaDB

          Constraints: Must contain from 8 to 41 characters.
              Microsoft SQL Server

          Constraints: Must contain from 8 to 128 characters.
              MySQL

          Constraints: Must contain from 8 to 41 characters.
              Oracle

          Constraints: Must contain from 8 to 30 characters.
              PostgreSQL

          Constraints: Must contain from 8 to 128 characters.

          NOTE:
              Amazon RDS API actions never return the password, so this action
              provides a way to regain access to a primary  instance  user  if
              the  password  is  lost. This includes restoring privileges that
              might have been accidentally revoked.

       --db-parameter-group-name (string)
          The name of the DB parameter group to apply to the DB instance.

          Changing this setting doesn't result in  an  outage.  The  parameter
          group  name  itself is changed immediately, but the actual parameter
          changes are not  applied  until  you  reboot  the  instance  without
          failover.  In  this  case,  the DB instance isn't rebooted automati-
          cally, and the parameter changes  aren't  applied  during  the  next
          maintenance window. However, if you modify dynamic parameters in the
          newly associated DB parameter group, these changes are applied imme-
          diately without a reboot.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Default: Uses existing setting

          Constraints: The DB parameter group must be in the same DB parameter
          group family as the DB instance.

       --backup-retention-period (integer)
          The number of days to retain automated backups. Setting this parame-
          ter  to a positive number enables backups. Setting this parameter to
          0 disables automated backups.

          NOTE:
              Enabling and disabling backups can result in a brief I/O suspen-
              sion  that  lasts from a few seconds to a few minutes, depending
              on the size and class of your DB instance.

          These changes are applied during the next maintenance window  unless
          the  ApplyImmediately  parameter is enabled for this request. If you
          change the parameter from one non-zero  value  to  another  non-zero
          value, the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.
              Amazon Aurora

          Not  applicable.  The retention period for automated backups is man-
          aged by the DB cluster. For more information, see ModifyDBCluster  .

          Default: Uses existing setting

          Constraints:

          o It  must  be  a value from 0 to 35. It can't be set to 0 if the DB
            instance is a source to read replicas. It can't be set to 0 or  35
            for an RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance.

          o It can be specified for a MySQL read replica only if the source is
            running MySQL 5.6 or later.

          o It can be specified for a PostgreSQL  read  replica  only  if  the
            source is running PostgreSQL 9.3.5.

       --preferred-backup-window (string)
          The  daily  time range during which automated backups are created if
          automated backups are enabled, as determined by the BackupRetention-
          Period  parameter. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an out-
          age and the change is asynchronously applied as  soon  as  possible.
          The  default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour
          block of time for each Amazon Web Services Region. For more informa-
          tion, see Backup window in the Amazon RDS User Guide.
              Amazon Aurora

          Not  applicable. The daily time range for creating automated backups
          is managed by the DB cluster. For more  information,  see  ModifyDB-
          Cluster .

          Constraints:

          o Must be in the format hh24:mi-hh24:mi

          o Must be in Universal Time Coordinated (UTC)

          o Must not conflict with the preferred maintenance window

          o Must be at least 30 minutes

       --preferred-maintenance-window (string)
          The  weekly  time range (in UTC) during which system maintenance can
          occur, which might result in  an  outage.  Changing  this  parameter
          doesn't  result in an outage, except in the following situation, and
          the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.  If  there
          are  pending actions that cause a reboot, and the maintenance window
          is changed to include the current time, then changing this parameter
          will cause a reboot of the DB instance. If moving this window to the
          current time, there must be at least 30 minutes between the  current
          time and end of the window to ensure pending changes are applied.

          For  more information, see Amazon RDS Maintenance Window in the Ama-
          zon RDS User Guide.

          Default: Uses existing setting

          Format: ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi

          Valid Days: Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun

          Constraints: Must be at least 30 minutes

       --multi-az | --no-multi-az (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether the DB instance is a Multi-AZ deploy-
          ment.  Changing  this  parameter  doesn't  result  in an outage. The
          change is applied during the  next  maintenance  window  unless  the
          ApplyImmediately parameter is enabled for this request.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --engine-version (string)
          The  version  number  of the database engine to upgrade to. Changing
          this parameter results in an outage and the change is applied during
          the next maintenance window unless the ApplyImmediately parameter is
          enabled for this request.

          For major version upgrades, if a nondefault DB  parameter  group  is
          currently in use, a new DB parameter group in the DB parameter group
          family for the new engine version must  be  specified.  The  new  DB
          parameter  group can be the default for that DB parameter group fam-
          ily.

          If you specify only a major version, Amazon RDS will update  the  DB
          instance  to  the default minor version if the current minor version
          is lower. For information about valid engine versions, see  CreateD-
          BInstance , or call DescribeDBEngineVersions .

          In  RDS  Custom  for  Oracle,  this  parameter is supported for read
          replicas only if they are in the PATCH_DB_FAILURE lifecycle.

       --allow-major-version-upgrade    |     --no-allow-major-version-upgrade
       (boolean)
          A  value  that indicates whether major version upgrades are allowed.
          Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage and  the  change
          is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Constraints:  Major version upgrades must be allowed when specifying
          a value for the EngineVersion parameter that is  a  different  major
          version than the DB instance's current version.

       --auto-minor-version-upgrade      |     --no-auto-minor-version-upgrade
       (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether minor version  upgrades  are  applied
          automatically  to  the DB instance during the maintenance window. An
          outage occurs when all the following conditions are met:

          o The automatic upgrade is enabled for the maintenance window.

          o A newer minor version is available.

          o RDS has enabled automatic patching for the engine version.

          If any of the preceding conditions isn't met, RDS applies the change
          as soon as possible and doesn't cause an outage.

          For  an RDS Custom DB instance, set AutoMinorVersionUpgrade to false
          . Otherwise, the operation returns an error.

       --license-model (string)
          The license model for the DB instance.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Valid  values:  license-included  |  bring-your-own-license  |  gen-
          eral-public-license

       --iops (integer)
          The  new  Provisioned IOPS (I/O operations per second) value for the
          RDS instance.

          Changing this setting doesn't result in an outage and the change  is
          applied  during  the next maintenance window unless the ApplyImmedi-
          ately parameter is enabled for this request. If  you  are  migrating
          from  Provisioned IOPS to standard storage, set this value to 0. The
          DB instance will require a reboot for the change in storage type  to
          take effect.

          If  you choose to migrate your DB instance from using standard stor-
          age to using Provisioned IOPS, or from  using  Provisioned  IOPS  to
          using  standard  storage, the process can take time. The duration of
          the migration depends on several  factors  such  as  database  load,
          storage size, storage type (standard or Provisioned IOPS), amount of
          IOPS provisioned (if any), and the number  of  prior  scale  storage
          operations.  Typical  migration  times  are  under 24 hours, but the
          process can take up to several days in some cases. During the migra-
          tion,  the  DB  instance  is available for use, but might experience
          performance degradation. While the migration  takes  place,  nightly
          backups  for  the instance are suspended. No other Amazon RDS opera-
          tions can take place  for  the  instance,  including  modifying  the
          instance,  rebooting the instance, deleting the instance, creating a
          read replica for the instance, and creating a  DB  snapshot  of  the
          instance.

          Constraints:  For  MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL, the value
          supplied must be at least 10% greater than the current value. Values
          that  are  not  at  least  10%  greater  than the existing value are
          rounded up so that they are 10% greater than the current value.

          Default: Uses existing setting

       --option-group-name (string)
          A value that indicates the DB instance should be associated with the
          specified option group.

          Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage, with one excep-
          tion. If the parameter  change  results  in  an  option  group  that
          enables  OEM,  it can cause a brief period, lasting less than a sec-
          ond, during which new connections are rejected but existing  connec-
          tions aren't interrupted.

          The  change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the
          ApplyImmediately parameter is enabled for this request.

          Permanent options, such as the TDE option for Oracle Advanced  Secu-
          rity  TDE,  can't  be  removed from an option group, and that option
          group can't be removed from a DB instance  after  it  is  associated
          with a DB instance.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --new-db-instance-identifier (string)
          The  new  DB instance identifier for the DB instance when renaming a
          DB instance. When you change the DB instance identifier, an instance
          reboot  occurs  immediately if you enable ApplyImmediately , or will
          occur during the next maintenance window if you disable Apply  Imme-
          diately. This value is stored as a lowercase string.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

          o The first character must be a letter.

          o Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

          Example: mydbinstance

       --storage-type (string)
          Specifies the storage type to be associated with the DB instance.

          If  you  specify  Provisioned  IOPS  (io1 ), you must also include a
          value for the Iops parameter.

          If you choose to migrate your DB instance from using standard  stor-
          age  to  using  Provisioned  IOPS, or from using Provisioned IOPS to
          using standard storage, the process can take time. The  duration  of
          the  migration  depends  on  several  factors such as database load,
          storage size, storage type (standard or Provisioned IOPS), amount of
          IOPS  provisioned  (if  any),  and the number of prior scale storage
          operations. Typical migration times are  under  24  hours,  but  the
          process can take up to several days in some cases. During the migra-
          tion, the DB instance is available for  use,  but  might  experience
          performance  degradation.  While  the migration takes place, nightly
          backups for the instance are suspended. No other Amazon  RDS  opera-
          tions  can  take  place  for  the  instance, including modifying the
          instance, rebooting the instance, deleting the instance, creating  a
          read  replica  for  the  instance, and creating a DB snapshot of the

          Valid values: standard | gp2 | io1

          Default: io1 if the Iops parameter is specified, otherwise gp2

       --tde-credential-arn (string)
          The ARN from the key store with which to associate the instance  for
          TDE encryption.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --tde-credential-password (string)
          The password for the given ARN from the key store in order to access
          the device.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Specifies the certificate to associate with the DB instance.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --domain (string)
          The Active Directory directory ID to move the DB instance to.  Spec-
          ify  none  to  remove the instance from its current domain. You must
          create the domain before this operation. Currently, you  can  create
          only   MySQL,  Microsoft  SQL  Server,  Oracle,  and  PostgreSQL  DB
          instances in an Active Directory Domain.

          For more information, see Kerberos Authentication in the Amazon  RDS
          User Guide .

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --copy-tags-to-snapshot | --no-copy-tags-to-snapshot (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to copy all tags from the DB instance
          to snapshots of the DB instance. By default, tags are not copied.
              Amazon Aurora

          Not applicable. Copying tags to snapshots is managed by the DB clus-
          ter.  Setting  this value for an Aurora DB instance has no effect on
          the DB cluster setting. For more information, see ModifyDBCluster  .

       --monitoring-interval (integer)
          The  interval,  in  seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring
          metrics are collected for the DB  instance.  To  disable  collecting
          Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify 0, which is the default.

          If MonitoringRoleArn is specified, set MonitoringInterval to a value
          other than 0.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Valid Values: 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60

       --db-port-number (integer)
          The port number on which the database accepts connections.

          The value of the DBPortNumber parameter must not match  any  of  the
          port  values  specified  for  options in the option group for the DB
          instance.

          If you change the DBPortNumber value, your database restarts regard-
          less of the value of the ApplyImmediately parameter.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --publicly-accessible | --no-publicly-accessible (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether the DB instance is publicly  accessi-
          ble.

          When  the  DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System
          (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB
          cluster's  virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP
          address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC. Access to the DB clus-
          ter  is  ultimately  controlled  by the security group it uses. That
          public access isn't permitted if the security group assigned to  the
          DB cluster doesn't permit it.

          When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB
          instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.
              PubliclyAccessible only applies to DB instances in a VPC. The DB
              instance  must be part of a public subnet and PubliclyAccessible
              must be enabled for it to be publicly accessible.

          Changes to the PubliclyAccessible parameter are applied  immediately
          regardless of the value of the ApplyImmediately parameter.

       --monitoring-role-arn (string)
          The  ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS to send enhanced monitor-
          ing   metrics   to   Amazon   CloudWatch    Logs.    For    example,
          arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess . For information on creating
          a monitoring role, see To create an IAM role for Amazon RDS Enhanced
          Monitoring in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

          If MonitoringInterval is set to a value other than 0, supply a Moni-
          toringRoleArn value.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --domain-iam-role-name (string)
          The name of the IAM role to use when making API calls to the  Direc-
          tory Service.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --promotion-tier (integer)
          A  value that specifies the order in which an Aurora Replica is pro-
          moted to the primary instance after a failure of the  existing  pri-
          mary  instance.  For  more  information,  see Fault Tolerance for an
          Aurora DB Cluster in the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Default: 1

          Valid Values: 0 - 15

       --enable-iam-database-authentication | --no-enable-iam-database-authen-
       tication (boolean)
          A  value that indicates whether to enable mapping of Amazon Web Ser-
          vices Identity and Access  Management  (IAM)  accounts  to  database
          accounts. By default, mapping isn't enabled.

          This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora. Mapping Amazon Web Ser-
          vices IAM accounts to database accounts is managed by the  DB  clus-
          ter.

          For  more  information  about  IAM  database authentication, see IAM
          Database Authentication for MySQL and PostgreSQL in the  Amazon  RDS
          User Guide.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --enable-performance-insights     |    --no-enable-performance-insights
       (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to enable  Performance  Insights  for
          the DB instance.

          For  more  information, see Using Amazon Performance Insights in the
          Amazon Relational Database Service User Guide .

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --performance-insights-kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for encryption of Perfor-
          mance Insights data.

          The  Amazon  Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID,
          alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

          If you do not specify a value for PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId , then
          Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for
          your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web  Services  account
          has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --performance-insights-retention-period (integer)
          The amount of time, in days, to retain  Performance  Insights  data.
          Valid values are 7 or 731 (2 years).

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --cloudwatch-logs-export-configuration (structure)
          The configuration setting for the log types to be enabled for export
          to CloudWatch Logs for a specific DB instance.

          A  change  to  the  CloudwatchLogsExportConfiguration  parameter  is
          always applied to the DB instance immediately. Therefore, the Apply-
          Immediately parameter has no effect.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          EnableLogTypes -> (list)
              The list of log types to enable.

              (string)

          DisableLogTypes -> (list)
              The list of log types to disable.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          EnableLogTypes=string,string,DisableLogTypes=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "EnableLogTypes": ["string", ...],
            "DisableLogTypes": ["string", ...]
          }

       --processor-features (list)
          The number of CPU cores and the number of threads per core  for  the
          DB instance class of the DB instance.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          (structure)
              Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

              To  specify  the  number of CPU cores, use the coreCount feature
              name for the Name parameter. To specify the  number  of  threads
              per  core,  use  the  threadsPerCore  feature  name for the Name
              parameter.

              You can set the processor features of the DB instance class  for
              a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

              o CreateDBInstance

              o ModifyDBInstance

              o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

              o RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

              o RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime

              You  can  view  the  valid  processor  values  for  a particular
              instance class by calling the DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions
              action and specifying the instance class for the DBInstanceClass
              parameter.

              In addition, you can use the following actions for  DB  instance
              class processor information:

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribeDBSnapshots

              o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

              If  you  call  DescribeDBInstances  ,  ProcessorFeature  returns
              non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

              o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

              o Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the  number
                of CPU cores and threads per core.

              o The  current  number  CPU  cores  and  threads  is  set  to  a
                non-default value.

              For more information, see Configuring the Processor  of  the  DB
              Instance Class in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name of the processor feature. Valid names are coreCount
                 and threadsPerCore .

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of a processor feature name.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --use-default-processor-features |  --no-use-default-processor-features
       (boolean)
          A  value  that  indicates  whether  the  DB instance class of the DB
          instance uses its default processor features.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether the DB instance has deletion  protec-
          tion enabled. The database can't be deleted when deletion protection
          is enabled. By default, deletion protection isn't enabled. For  more
          information, see Deleting a DB Instance .

       --max-allocated-storage (integer)
          The upper limit in gibibytes (GiB) to which Amazon RDS can automati-
          cally scale the storage of the DB instance.

          For more information about this setting, including limitations  that
          apply  to  it,  see  Managing capacity automatically with Amazon RDS
          storage autoscaling in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --certificate-rotation-restart   |    --no-certificate-rotation-restart
       (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether the DB instance is restarted when you
          rotate your SSL/TLS certificate.

          By default, the DB  instance  is  restarted  when  you  rotate  your
          SSL/TLS  certificate.  The  certificate  is not updated until the DB
          instance is restarted.

          WARNING:
              Set this parameter only if you are not using SSL/TLS to  connect
              to the DB instance.

          If  you  are using SSL/TLS to connect to the DB instance, follow the
          appropriate instructions for your DB engine to rotate  your  SSL/TLS
          certificate:

          o For  more  information about rotating your SSL/TLS certificate for
            RDS DB engines, see Rotating Your SSL/TLS Certificate. in the Ama-
            zon RDS User Guide.

          o For  more  information about rotating your SSL/TLS certificate for
            Aurora DB engines, see Rotating Your SSL/TLS  Certificate  in  the
            Amazon Aurora User Guide.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --replica-mode (string)
          A  value  that  sets  the  open mode of a replica database to either
          mounted or read-only.

          NOTE:
              Currently, this  parameter  is  only  supported  for  Oracle  DB
              instances.

          Mounted  DB  replicas are included in Oracle Enterprise Edition. The
          main use case for mounted replicas is cross-Region  disaster  recov-
          ery.  The primary database doesn't use Active Data Guard to transmit
          information to the mounted replica. Because it doesn't  accept  user
          connections, a mounted replica can't serve a read-only workload. For
          more information, see Working with Oracle Read Replicas  for  Amazon
          RDS in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Possible values:

          o open-read-only

          o mounted

       --enable-customer-owned-ip | --no-enable-customer-owned-ip (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to enable a customer-owned IP address
          (CoIP) for an RDS on Outposts DB instance.

          A CoIP provides local or external connectivity to resources in  your
          Outpost  subnets  through  your  on-premises  network.  For some use
          cases, a CoIP can provide lower latency for connections  to  the  DB
          instance  from  outside  of  its virtual private cloud (VPC) on your
          local network.

          For more information about RDS on Outposts, see Working with  Amazon
          RDS on Amazon Web Services Outposts in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          For more information about CoIPs, see Customer-owned IP addresses in
          the Amazon Web Services Outposts User Guide .

       --aws-backup-recovery-point-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the recovery point in  Amazon  Web
          Services Backup.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --automation-mode (string)
          The  automation  mode  of  the  RDS  Custom DB instance: full or all
          paused . If full , the DB instance automates monitoring and instance
          recovery.  If  all  paused  , the instance pauses automation for the
          duration set by ResumeFullAutomationModeMinutes .

          Possible values:

          o full

          o all-paused

       --resume-full-automation-mode-minutes (integer)
          The number of minutes to pause the automation. When the time  period
          ends,  RDS  Custom  resumes full automation. The minimum value is 60
          (default). The maximum value is 1,440 .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To modify a DB instance

       The following modify-db-instance example associates an option group and
       a  parameter  group with a compatible Microsoft SQL Server DB instance.
       The --apply-immediately  parameter  causes  the  option  and  parameter
       groups  to be associated immediately, instead of waiting until the next
       maintenance window.

              within the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves
              to  the  public IP address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC.
              Access to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by  the  secu-
              rity  group  it  uses. That public access isn't permitted if the
              security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it.

              When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an  inter-
              nal  DB  instance  with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP
              address.

                 You can view the valid  processor  values  for  a  particular
                 instance  class by calling the DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOp-
                 tions action and specifying the instance class for the  DBIn-
                 stanceClass parameter.

                 In  addition,  you  can  use  the  following  actions  for DB
                 instance class processor information:

                 o DescribeDBInstances

                 o DescribeDBSnapshots

                 o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

                 If you call DescribeDBInstances  ,  ProcessorFeature  returns
                 non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

                 o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

                 o Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the num-
                   ber of CPU cores and threads per core.

                 o The current number CPU  cores  and  threads  is  set  to  a
                   non-default value.
