          parameter isn't case-sensitive.

          Constraints:  This identifier must match the identifier of an exist-
          ing DB cluster.

          Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters

       --new-db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The new DB cluster identifier for the DB cluster when renaming a  DB
          cluster. This value is stored as a lowercase string.

          Constraints:

          Example: my-cluster2

          Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only

       --apply-immediately | --no-apply-immediately (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether the modifications in this request and
          any pending modifications are asynchronously applied as soon as pos-
          sible,  regardless of the PreferredMaintenanceWindow setting for the
          DB cluster. If this parameter is disabled, changes to the DB cluster
          are applied during the next maintenance window.

          The ApplyImmediately parameter only affects the EnableIAMDatabaseAu-
          thentication , MasterUserPassword , and NewDBClusterIdentifier  val-

              cally. Also, parameter changes aren't applied  during  the  next
              maintenance window but instead are applied immediately.

          Default: The existing name setting

          Constraints:

          o The DB parameter group must be in the same DB parameter group fam-
            ily as this DB cluster.

          MinCapacity -> (integer)
              The minimum capacity for an Aurora DB cluster in  serverless  DB
              engine mode.

              For Aurora MySQL, valid capacity values are 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 ,
              32 , 64 , 128 , and 256 .

              For Aurora PostgreSQL, valid capacity values are 2 , 4 , 8 ,  16
              , 32 , 64 , 192 , and 384 .

              The  minimum  capacity must be less than or equal to the maximum
              capacity.

          MaxCapacity -> (integer)
              The maximum capacity for an Aurora DB cluster in  serverless  DB
              engine mode.

              For Aurora MySQL, valid capacity values are 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 ,
              32 , 64 , 128 , and 256 .

              For Aurora PostgreSQL, valid capacity values are 2 , 4 , 8 ,  16
              , 32 , 64 , 192 , and 384 .

              The  maximum capacity must be greater than or equal to the mini-
              mum capacity.

          AutoPause -> (boolean)
              A value that indicates whether to allow  or  disallow  automatic
              pause  for  an Aurora DB cluster in serverless DB engine mode. A
              DB cluster can be paused only when it's idle (it has no  connec-
              tions).

              NOTE:
                 If  a  DB  cluster is paused for more than seven days, the DB
                 cluster might be backed up with a snapshot. In this case, the
                 DB  cluster is restored when there is a request to connect to
                 it.

          SecondsUntilAutoPause -> (integer)
              The time, in seconds, before an Aurora DB cluster in  serverless
              mode is paused.

              Specify a value between 300 and 86,400 seconds.

          TimeoutAction -> (string)
              The  action to take when the timeout is reached, either ForceAp-
              plyCapacityChange or RollbackCapacityChange .
                 ForceApplyCapacityChange sets the capacity to  the  specified
                 value as soon as possible.

                 RollbackCapacityChange  ,  the  default, ignores the capacity
                 change if a scaling point isn't found in the timeout  period.

              WARNING:
                 If  you  specify  ForceApplyCapacityChange , connections that
                 prevent Aurora Serverless from finding a scaling point  might
                 be dropped.

              For  more  information, see Autoscaling for Aurora Serverless in
              the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

          SecondsBeforeTimeout -> (integer)
              The amount of time, in seconds, that Aurora Serverless tries  to
              find  a scaling point to perform seamless scaling before enforc-
              ing the timeout action. The default is 300.

              Specify a value between 60 and 600 seconds.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MinCapacity=integer,MaxCapacity=integer,AutoPause=boolean,SecondsUntilAutoPause=integer,TimeoutAction=string,SecondsBeforeTimeout=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MinCapacity": integer,
            "MaxCapacity": integer,
            "AutoPause": true|false,
            "SecondsUntilAutoPause": integer,
            "TimeoutAction": "string",
            "SecondsBeforeTimeout": integer
          }

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether the DB cluster has  deletion  protec-
          tion enabled. The database can't be deleted when deletion protection
          is enabled. By default, deletion protection isn't enabled.

          Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters

       --enable-http-endpoint | --no-enable-http-endpoint (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to enable the HTTP  endpoint  for  an
          Aurora  Serverless DB cluster. By default, the HTTP endpoint is dis-
          abled.

          When enabled, the HTTP endpoint provides a connectionless  web  ser-
          vice  API  for running SQL queries on the Aurora Serverless DB clus-
          ter. You can also query your database from inside  the  RDS  console
          with the query editor.

          For  more  information, see Using the Data API for Aurora Serverless
          in the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

          Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only

       --copy-tags-to-snapshot | --no-copy-tags-to-snapshot (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to copy all tags from the DB  cluster
          to snapshots of the DB cluster. The default is not to copy them.

          Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only

       --enable-global-write-forwarding  | --no-enable-global-write-forwarding
       (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to enable this DB cluster to  forward
          write operations to the primary cluster of an Aurora global database
          ( GlobalCluster ). By default, write operations are not  allowed  on
          Aurora  DB  clusters that are secondary clusters in an Aurora global
          database.

          You can set this value only on Aurora DB clusters that  are  members
          of  an  Aurora  global database. With this parameter enabled, a sec-
          ondary cluster can forward writes to the current primary cluster and
          the  resulting  changes are replicated back to this cluster. For the
          primary DB cluster of an Aurora global database, this value is  used
          immediately  if the primary is demoted by the  FailoverGlobalCluster
          API operation, but it does nothing until then.

          Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only

       --db-cluster-instance-class (string)
          The compute and memory capacity of each DB instance in the  Multi-AZ

          automatically  to  the  DB cluster during the maintenance window. By
          default, minor engine upgrades are applied automatically.

          Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only

       --monitoring-interval (integer)
          The interval, in seconds, between points  when  Enhanced  Monitoring
          metrics  are  collected  for  the DB cluster. To turn off collecting
          Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify 0. The default is 0.

          If MonitoringRoleArn is specified, also set MonitoringInterval to  a
          value other than 0.

          Valid Values: 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60

          Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only

       --monitoring-role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the IAM role that permits RDS to
          send Enhanced Monitoring metrics to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. An exam-
          ple  is  arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess . For information on
          creating a monitoring role, see To create an IAM role for Amazon RDS
          Enhanced Monitoring in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

          If MonitoringInterval is set to a value other than 0, supply a Moni-
          toringRoleArn value.

          Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only

       --enable-performance-insights    |     --no-enable-performance-insights
       (boolean)
          A  value  that indicates whether to turn on Performance Insights for
          the DB cluster.

          For more information, see Using Amazon Performance Insights  in  the
          Amazon RDS User Guide .

          Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only

       --performance-insights-kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for encryption of Perfor-
          mance Insights data.

          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN,  key  ID,
          alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

          If  you don't specify a value for PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId , then
          Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for
          your  Amazon  Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account
          has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

          Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only

       --performance-insights-retention-period (integer)
          The  amount  of  time, in days, to retain Performance Insights data.
          Valid values are 7 or 731 (2 years).

          Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To modify a DB cluster

       The following modify-db-cluster example changes the master  user  pass-
       word  for  the DB cluster named cluster-2 and sets the backup retention
       period to 14 days. The --apply-immediately parameter causes the changes
       to  be  made immediately, instead of waiting until the next maintenance
       window.

          aws rds modify-db-cluster \
              --db-cluster-identifier cluster-2 \
              --backup-retention-period 14 \
              --master-user-password newpassword99 \
              --apply-immediately

OUTPUT
       DBCluster -> (structure)
          Contains  the  details of an Amazon Aurora DB cluster or Multi-AZ DB
          cluster.

          For an Amazon Aurora DB  cluster,  this  data  type  is  used  as  a
          response element in the operations CreateDBCluster , DeleteDBCluster
          , DescribeDBClusters , FailoverDBCluster ,  ModifyDBCluster  ,  Pro-
          moteReadReplicaDBCluster  ,  RestoreDBClusterFromS3 , RestoreDBClus-
          terFromSnapshot , RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime ,  StartDBCluster  ,
          and StopDBCluster .

          For a Multi-AZ DB cluster, this data type is used as a response ele-
          ment  in  the  operations  CreateDBCluster   ,   DeleteDBCluster   ,
          DescribeDBClusters , FailoverDBCluster , ModifyDBCluster , RebootDB-
          Cluster ,  RestoreDBClusterFromSnapshot  ,  and  RestoreDBClusterTo-
          PointInTime .

          For  more information on Amazon Aurora DB clusters, see What is Ama-
          zon Aurora? in the Amazon Aurora User Guide.

          For more information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see  Multi-AZ  deploy-
          ments  with two readable standby DB instances in the Amazon RDS User
          Guide.

              The Multi-AZ DB clusters feature is in preview and is subject to
              change.

          AllocatedStorage -> (integer)
              For  all database engines except Amazon Aurora, AllocatedStorage
              specifies the allocated storage size  in  gibibytes  (GiB).  For
              Aurora,  AllocatedStorage  always  returns  1, because Aurora DB
              cluster storage size  isn't  fixed,  but  instead  automatically
              adjusts as needed.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              Provides the list of Availability Zones (AZs) where instances in
              the DB cluster can be created.

              (string)

          BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              Specifies the number of days for which  automatic  DB  snapshots
              are retained.

          CharacterSetName -> (string)
              If  present,  specifies  the name of the character set that this
              cluster is associated with.

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              Contains the name of the initial database  of  this  DB  cluster
              that  was provided at create time, if one was specified when the
              DB cluster was created. This same name is returned for the  life
              of the DB cluster.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains  a user-supplied DB cluster identifier. This identifier
              is the unique key that identifies a DB cluster.

          DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
              Specifies the name of the DB cluster parameter group for the  DB
              cluster.

          DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
              Specifies information on the subnet group associated with the DB
              cluster, including the name, description,  and  subnets  in  the
              subnet group.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the current state of this DB cluster.

          AutomaticRestartTime -> (timestamp)
              The time when a stopped DB cluster is restarted automatically.

          PercentProgress -> (string)
              Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.

          EarliestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              The  earliest  time  to  which  a  database can be restored with
              point-in-time restore.

          Endpoint -> (string)
              Specifies the connection endpoint for the  primary  instance  of
              the DB cluster.

          ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
              The  reader endpoint for the DB cluster. The reader endpoint for
              a DB cluster load-balances connections across the Aurora  Repli-
              cas  that  are available in a DB cluster. As clients request new
              connections to the reader endpoint, Aurora distributes the  con-
              nection  requests  among  the Aurora Replicas in the DB cluster.
              This functionality can help balance your  read  workload  across
              multiple Aurora Replicas in your DB cluster.

              If  a  failover occurs, and the Aurora Replica that you are con-
              nected to is promoted to be the primary instance,  your  connec-
              tion is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to other
              Aurora Replicas in the cluster, you can then  reconnect  to  the
              reader endpoint.

          CustomEndpoints -> (list)
              Identifies all custom endpoints associated with the cluster.

              Indicates the database engine version.

          LatestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              Specifies  the  latest  time to which a database can be restored
              with point-in-time restore.

              Specifies  the  daily  time range during which automated backups
              are created if automated backups are enabled, as  determined  by
              the BackupRetentionPeriod .

          PreferredMaintenanceWindow -> (string)
              Specifies  the weekly time range during which system maintenance
              can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

                     instance for the DB cluster and false otherwise.

                 DBClusterParameterGroupStatus -> (string)
                     Specifies  the  status  of the DB cluster parameter group
                     for this member of the DB cluster.

                 PromotionTier -> (integer)
                     A value that specifies  the  order  in  which  an  Aurora
                     Replica is promoted to the primary instance after a fail-

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              If  StorageEncrypted is enabled, the Amazon Web Services KMS key
              identifier for the encrypted DB cluster.

              The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key  ARN,  key
              ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

          DbClusterResourceId -> (string)

          PubliclyAccessible -> (boolean)
              Specifies the accessibility options for the DB instance.

              When the DB instance is publicly  accessible,  its  Domain  Name
              System  (DNS)  endpoint  resolves to the private IP address from
              within  the  DB  instance's  virtual  private  cloud  (VPC).  It
              resolves  to  the  public  IP  address  from  outside  of the DB
              instance's VPC. Access to the DB  instance  is  ultimately  con-
              trolled by the security group it uses. That public access is not
              permitted if the security group  assigned  to  the  DB  instance
              doesn't permit it.

              When  the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an inter-
              nal DB instance with a DNS name that resolves to  a  private  IP
              address.

              For more information, see  CreateDBInstance .
