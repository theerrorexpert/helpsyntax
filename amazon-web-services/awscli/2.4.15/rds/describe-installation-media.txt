DESCRIBE-INSTALLATION-MEDIA()                    DESCRIBE-INSTALLATION-MEDIA()



NAME
       describe-installation-media -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  available  installation  media  for  a  DB  engine that
       requires an on-premises customer provided license,  such  as  Microsoft
       SQL Server.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-installation-media  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: InstallationMedia

SYNOPSIS
            describe-installation-media
          [--installation-media-id <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --installation-media-id (string)
          The installation medium ID.

       --filters (list)
          A filter that specifies one or more installation media to  describe.
          Supported filters include the following:

          o custom-availability-zone-id  -  Accepts  custom  Availability Zone
            (AZ) identifiers. The results list includes information about only
            the custom AZs identified by these identifiers.

          o engine  -  Accepts  database  engines.  The  results list includes
            information about only the database engines  identified  by  these
            identifiers.  For  more  information  about  the valid engines for
            installation media, see  ImportInstallationMedia .

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              IDs.  The  filters  supported  by a describe operation are docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are  case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
