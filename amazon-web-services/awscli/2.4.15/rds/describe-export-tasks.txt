DESCRIBE-EXPORT-TASKS()                                DESCRIBE-EXPORT-TASKS()



NAME
       describe-export-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  a  snapshot  export to Amazon S3. This API
       operation supports pagination.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-export-tasks is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: ExportTasks

SYNOPSIS
            describe-export-tasks
          [--export-task-identifier <value>]
          [--source-arn <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --export-task-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the snapshot export task to be described.

       --source-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the snapshot exported to Amazon
          S3.

       --filters (list)
          Filters specify one or more snapshot exports to describe.  The  fil-
          ters  are  specified as name-value pairs that define what to include
          in the output. Filter names and values are case-sensitive.

          Supported filters include the following:

          o export-task-identifier - An identifier  for  the  snapshot  export
            task.

          o s3-bucket - The Amazon S3 bucket the snapshot is exported to.

          o source-arn  -  The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of the snapshot
            exported to Amazon S3

          o status - The status of the export task. Must be  lowercase.  Valid
            statuses are the following:

            o canceled

            o canceling

            o complete

            o failed

            o in_progress

            o starting

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              IDs. The filters supported by a  describe  operation  are  docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One  or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          A  pagination  token that can be used in a later DescribeExportTasks
          request. A marker is used for pagination to identify the location to
          begin output for the next response of DescribeExportTasks .

                 (string)

              SnapshotTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the snapshot was created.

                 the exported snapshot.

              IamRoleArn -> (string)
                 The  name  of the IAM role that is used to write to Amazon S3

                 The key identifier of the Amazon Web Services KMS key that is
                 used to encrypt the snapshot when it's exported to Amazon S3.
                 The KMS key identifier is its key ARN, key ID, alias ARN,  or
                 alias  name.  The  IAM role used for the snapshot export must
                 have encryption and decryption permissions to  use  this  KMS
