MODIFY-EVENT-SUBSCRIPTION()                        MODIFY-EVENT-SUBSCRIPTION()



NAME
       modify-event-subscription -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  an  existing  RDS  event notification subscription. You can't
       modify the source identifiers using this call. To change source identi-
       fiers for a subscription, use the AddSourceIdentifierToSubscription and
       RemoveSourceIdentifierFromSubscription calls.

       You can see a list of the event categories  for  a  given  source  type
       (SourceType  )  in  Events in the Amazon RDS User Guide or by using the
       DescribeEventCategories operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-event-subscription
          --subscription-name <value>
          [--sns-topic-arn <value>]
          [--source-type <value>]
          [--event-categories <value>]
          [--enabled | --no-enabled]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subscription-name (string)
          The name of the RDS event notification subscription.

       --sns-topic-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SNS topic  created  for  event
          notification.  The  ARN  is  created by Amazon SNS when you create a
          topic and subscribe to it.

       --source-type (string)
          The type of source that is generating the events.  For  example,  if
          you  want  to  be notified of events generated by a DB instance, you
          would set this parameter to db-instance. For RDS Proxy events, spec-
          ify  db-proxy  .  If  this  value  isn't  specified,  all events are
          returned.

          Valid  values:  db-instance  |  db-cluster  |  db-parameter-group  |
          db-security-group | db-snapshot | db-cluster-snapshot | db-proxy

       --event-categories (list)
          A  list of event categories for a source type (SourceType ) that you
          want to subscribe to. You can see a list of  the  categories  for  a
          given source type in Events in the Amazon RDS User Guide or by using
          the DescribeEventCategories operation.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --enabled | --no-enabled (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to activate the subscription.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To modify an event subscription

       The following modify-event-subscription example disables the  specified
       event subscription, so that it no longer publishes notifications to the
       specified Amazon Simple Notification Service topic.

          aws rds modify-event-subscription \
              --subscription-name my-instance-events \
              --no-enabled

       Output:

          {
              "EventSubscription": {
                  "EventCategoriesList": [
                      "backup",
                      "recovery"
                  ],
                  "CustomerAwsId": "123456789012",
                  "SourceType": "db-instance",
                  "SubscriptionCreationTime": "Tue Jul 31 23:22:01 UTC 2018",
                  "EventSubscriptionArn": "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:es:my-instance-events",
                  "SnsTopicArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:interesting-events",

          DescribeEventSubscriptions action.

          CustomerAwsId -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services customer account associated with the RDS
              event notification subscription.

          CustSubscriptionId -> (string)
              The RDS event notification subscription Id.

              The status "no-permission" indicates that RDS no longer has per-

              The source type for the RDS event notification subscription.

          SourceIdsList -> (list)
              A list of source IDs for the RDS  event  notification  subscrip-
              tion.

              (string)

          EventCategoriesList -> (list)
              A  list  of event categories for the RDS event notification sub-
              scription.

              (string)
