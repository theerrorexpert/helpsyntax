NAME
       describe-event-subscriptions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  the  subscription  descriptions for a customer account. The
       description for a subscription includes SubscriptionName ,  SNSTopicARN
       , CustomerID , SourceType , SourceID , CreationTime , and Status .

       If you specify a SubscriptionName , lists the description for that sub-
       scription.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-event-subscriptions is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: EventSubscriptionsList

SYNOPSIS
            describe-event-subscriptions
          [--subscription-name <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subscription-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  RDS  event notification subscription you want to
          describe.

       --filters (list)
          This parameter isn't currently supported.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              IDs.  The  filters  supported  by a describe operation are docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are  case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          An  optional  pagination token provided by a previous DescribeOrder-
          ableDBInstanceOptions request. If this parameter is  specified,  the
          response  includes  only  records beyond the marker, up to the value
          specified by MaxRecords .

       EventSubscriptionsList -> (list)
          A list of EventSubscriptions data types.

          (structure)
              Contains  the  results  of  a  successful  invocation   of   the
              DescribeEventSubscriptions action.

              CustomerAwsId -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Web Services customer account associated with the
                 RDS event notification subscription.

              CustSubscriptionId -> (string)
                 The RDS event notification subscription Id.

              SnsTopicArn -> (string)
                 The topic ARN of the RDS event notification subscription.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the RDS event notification subscription.

                 Constraints:

                 Can be one of the following: creating | modifying |  deleting
                 | active | no-permission | topic-not-exist

                 The  status  "no-permission" indicates that RDS no longer has
                 permission  to  post   to   the   SNS   topic.   The   status
                 "topic-not-exist"  indicates that the topic was deleted after
                 the subscription was created.

              SubscriptionCreationTime -> (string)
                 The time the RDS event notification subscription was created.

                 The  source type for the RDS event notification subscription.

              SourceIdsList -> (list)
                 A list of source IDs for the RDS event notification subscrip-
                 tion.

                 A Boolean value indicating if the  subscription  is  enabled.
                 True indicates the subscription is enabled.
