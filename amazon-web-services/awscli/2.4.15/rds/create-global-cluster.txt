CREATE-GLOBAL-CLUSTER()                                CREATE-GLOBAL-CLUSTER()



NAME
       create-global-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  Aurora  global  database spread across multiple Amazon Web
       Services Regions. The global database contains a single primary cluster
       with  read-write  capability,  and  a  read-only secondary cluster that
       receives data from the primary cluster through  high-speed  replication
       performed by the Aurora storage subsystem.

       You  can create a global database that is initially empty, and then add
       a primary cluster and a secondary cluster to it. Or you can specify  an
       existing  Aurora  cluster during the create operation, and this cluster
       becomes the primary cluster of the global database.

       NOTE:
          This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-global-cluster
          [--global-cluster-identifier <value>]
          [--source-db-cluster-identifier <value>]
          [--engine <value>]
          [--engine-version <value>]
          [--deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection]
          [--database-name <value>]
          [--storage-encrypted | --no-storage-encrypted]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-cluster-identifier (string)
          The cluster identifier of the new global database cluster.

       --source-db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to use as the primary cluster of  the
          global database. This parameter is optional.

       --engine (string)
          The name of the database engine to be used for this DB cluster.

       --engine-version (string)
          The engine version of the Aurora global database.

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          The  deletion  protection  setting  for the new global database. The
          global  database  can't  be  deleted  when  deletion  protection  is
          enabled.

       --database-name (string)
          The  name for your database of up to 64 alpha-numeric characters. If
          you do not provide a name, Amazon Aurora will not create a  database
          in the global database cluster you are creating.

       --storage-encrypted | --no-storage-encrypted (boolean)
          The  storage encryption setting for the new global database cluster.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a global DB cluster

       The  following  create-global-cluster  example  creates  a  new  Aurora
       MySQL-compatible global DB cluster.

          aws rds create-global-cluster \
              --global-cluster-identifier myglobalcluster \
              --engine aurora-mysql

                 o failing-over  This status covers the range of Aurora inter-
                   nal operations that take place during the failover process,
                   such  as  demoting the primary Aurora DB cluster, promoting
                   the secondary Aurora DB, and synchronizing replicas.

                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Aurora DB cluster that
                 is currently being promoted, and  which  is  associated  with
                 this state.
