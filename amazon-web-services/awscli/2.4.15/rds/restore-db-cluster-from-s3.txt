RESTORE-DB-CLUSTER-FROM-S3()                      RESTORE-DB-CLUSTER-FROM-S3()



NAME
       restore-db-cluster-from-s3 -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an Amazon Aurora DB cluster from MySQL data stored in an Amazon
       S3 bucket. Amazon RDS must be authorized to access the Amazon S3 bucket
       and  the  data  must be created using the Percona XtraBackup utility as
       described in Migrating Data from MySQL by Using an Amazon S3 Bucket  in
       the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

       NOTE:
          This  action  only restores the DB cluster, not the DB instances for
          that DB cluster. You must invoke the CreateDBInstance action to cre-
          ate DB instances for the restored DB cluster, specifying the identi-
          fier of the restored DB cluster in  DBClusterIdentifier  .  You  can
          create DB instances only after the RestoreDBClusterFromS3 action has
          completed and the DB cluster is available.

       For more information on Amazon Aurora, see What is  Amazon  Aurora?  in
       the Amazon Aurora User Guide.

       NOTE:
          This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters. The source DB engine
          must be MySQL.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for an encrypted DB clus-
          ter.

          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN,  key  ID,

          ARN.

          If the StorageEncrypted parameter is enabled, and you do not specify
          a value for the KmsKeyId parameter, then Amazon RDS  will  use  your
          default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Ser-
          vices account. Your Amazon Web  Services  account  has  a  different
          default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

          Valid values: mysql

       --source-engine-version (string)
          The version of the database that the backup files were created from.

          MySQL versions 5.5, 5.6, and 5.7 are supported.

          Example: 5.6.40 , 5.7.28

       --s3-bucket-name (string)

          create  the  Amazon  Aurora  DB  cluster.  If  you  do not specify a
          SourceS3Prefix value, then the Amazon Aurora DB cluster  is  created
          by using all of the files in the Amazon S3 bucket.

       --s3-ingestion-role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web Services Identity
          and Access Management (IAM)  role  that  authorizes  Amazon  RDS  to

       --backtrack-window (long)
          The  target  backtrack  window, in seconds. To disable backtracking,
          set this value to 0.

          NOTE:
              Currently, Backtrack is only supported for Aurora MySQL DB clus-
              ters.

          Default: 0

          Constraints:

          o If specified, this value must be set to a number from 0 to 259,200
            (72 hours).

       --enable-cloudwatch-logs-exports (list)
          The list of logs that the restored DB cluster is to export to Cloud-
          Watch  Logs.  The  values  in the list depend on the DB engine being
          used. For more information, see Publishing Database Logs  to  Amazon
          CloudWatch Logs in the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          A  value  that indicates whether the DB cluster has deletion protec-
          tion enabled. The database can't be deleted when deletion protection
          is enabled. By default, deletion protection isn't enabled.

       --copy-tags-to-snapshot | --no-copy-tags-to-snapshot (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to copy all tags from the restored DB
          cluster to snapshots of the restored DB cluster. The default is  not
          to copy them.

       --domain (string)
          Specify  the Active Directory directory ID to restore the DB cluster
          in. The domain must be created prior to this operation.

          For Amazon Aurora DB clusters, Amazon RDS can use Kerberos Authenti-
          cation  to  authenticate  users  that connect to the DB cluster. For
          more information, see Kerberos Authentication in the  Amazon  Aurora
          User Guide .

       --domain-iam-role-name (string)
          Specify the name of the IAM role to be used when making API calls to
          the Directory Service.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To restore an Amazon Aurora DB cluster from Amazon S3

       The following restore-db-cluster-from-s3  example  restores  an  Amazon
       Aurora  MySQL  version  5.7-compatible  DB  cluster from a MySQL 5.7 DB
       backup file in Amazon S3.

          aws rds restore-db-cluster-from-s3 \
              --db-cluster-identifier cluster-s3-restore \
              --engine aurora-mysql \

OUTPUT
       DBCluster -> (structure)
          Contains  the  details of an Amazon Aurora DB cluster or Multi-AZ DB
          cluster.

          For an Amazon Aurora DB  cluster,  this  data  type  is  used  as  a
          response element in the operations CreateDBCluster , DeleteDBCluster
          , DescribeDBClusters , FailoverDBCluster ,  ModifyDBCluster  ,  Pro-
          moteReadReplicaDBCluster  ,  RestoreDBClusterFromS3 , RestoreDBClus-
          terFromSnapshot , RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime ,  StartDBCluster  ,
          and StopDBCluster .

          For a Multi-AZ DB cluster, this data type is used as a response ele-
          ment  in  the  operations  CreateDBCluster   ,   DeleteDBCluster   ,
          DescribeDBClusters , FailoverDBCluster , ModifyDBCluster , RebootDB-
          Cluster ,  RestoreDBClusterFromSnapshot  ,  and  RestoreDBClusterTo-
          PointInTime .

          For  more information on Amazon Aurora DB clusters, see What is Ama-
          zon Aurora? in the Amazon Aurora User Guide.

          For more information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see  Multi-AZ  deploy-
          ments  with two readable standby DB instances in the Amazon RDS User
          Guide.

              For  all database engines except Amazon Aurora, AllocatedStorage
              specifies the allocated storage size  in  gibibytes  (GiB).  For
              Aurora,  AllocatedStorage  always  returns  1, because Aurora DB
              cluster storage size  isn't  fixed,  but  instead  automatically
              adjusts as needed.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              Provides the list of Availability Zones (AZs) where instances in
              the DB cluster can be created.

              (string)

          BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              Specifies the number of days for which  automatic  DB  snapshots
              are retained.

          CharacterSetName -> (string)
              If  present,  specifies  the name of the character set that this
              cluster is associated with.

              that  was provided at create time, if one was specified when the
              DB cluster was created. This same name is returned for the  life
              of the DB cluster.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains  a user-supplied DB cluster identifier. This identifier
              is the unique key that identifies a DB cluster.

              Specifies the connection endpoint for the  primary  instance  of
              the DB cluster.

          ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
              The  reader endpoint for the DB cluster. The reader endpoint for
              a DB cluster load-balances connections across the Aurora  Repli-
              cas  that  are available in a DB cluster. As clients request new
              connections to the reader endpoint, Aurora distributes the  con-
              nection  requests  among  the Aurora Replicas in the DB cluster.
              This functionality can help balance your  read  workload  across
              multiple Aurora Replicas in your DB cluster.

              If  a  failover occurs, and the Aurora Replica that you are con-
              nected to is promoted to be the primary instance,  your  connec-
              tion is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to other
              Aurora Replicas in the cluster, you can then  reconnect  to  the
              reader endpoint.

                     contain   only   the  set  of  Unicode  letters,  digits,
                     white-space, '_', '.', ':', '/', '=', '+', '-', '@' (Java
                     regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

                 Value -> (string)
                     A  value  is  the  optional  value of the tag. The string
                     value can be from 1 to 256 Unicode characters  in  length
                     and  can't be prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can
                     only contain only the set  of  Unicode  letters,  digits,
                     white-space, '_', '.', ':', '/', '=', '+', '-', '@' (Java
                     regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

          GlobalWriteForwardingStatus -> (string)
              Specifies whether a secondary cluster in an Aurora global  data-
              base  has  write  forwarding  enabled, not enabled, or is in the
              process of enabling it.

          GlobalWriteForwardingRequested -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether you have requested to enable write  forwarding
              for  a  secondary  cluster in an Aurora global database. Because
              write forwarding takes time to enable, check the value of  Glob-
              alWriteForwardingStatus  to  confirm  that  the request has com-
              pleted before using the write forwarding feature for this  clus-
              ter.

          PendingModifiedValues -> (structure)
              A  value that specifies that changes to the DB cluster are pend-
              ing. This element is only included  when  changes  are  pending.
              Specific changes are identified by subelements.

              PendingCloudwatchLogsExports -> (structure)
                 A list of the log types whose configuration is still pending.
                 In other words, these log types are in the process  of  being
                 activated or deactivated.

                 LogTypesToEnable -> (list)
                     Log  types  that are in the process of being deactivated.
                     After  they  are  deactivated,  these  log  types  aren't
                     exported to CloudWatch Logs.

                     (string)

                 LogTypesToDisable -> (list)
                     Log types that are in the process of being enabled. After
                     they are enabled, these log types are exported to  Cloud-
                     Watch Logs.

                     (string)

              DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
                 The DBClusterIdentifier value for the DB cluster.

              MasterUserPassword -> (string)
                 The master credentials for the DB cluster.

              IAMDatabaseAuthenticationEnabled -> (boolean)
                 A value that indicates whether mapping of Amazon Web Services
                 Identity and Access Management  (IAM)  accounts  to  database
                 accounts is enabled.

              EngineVersion -> (string)
                 The database engine version.

          DBClusterInstanceClass -> (string)
              The  name  of  the  compute  and memory capacity class of the DB
              instance.

              This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

          StorageType -> (string)
              The storage type associated with the DB cluster.

              This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

          Iops -> (integer)
              The Provisioned IOPS (I/O operations per second) value.

              This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

          PubliclyAccessible -> (boolean)
              Specifies the accessibility options for the DB instance.

              When the DB instance is publicly  accessible,  its  Domain  Name
              System  (DNS)  endpoint  resolves to the private IP address from
              within  the  DB  instance's  virtual  private  cloud  (VPC).  It
              resolves  to  the  public  IP  address  from  outside  of the DB
              instance's VPC. Access to the DB  instance  is  ultimately  con-
              trolled by the security group it uses. That public access is not
              permitted if the security group  assigned  to  the  DB  instance
              doesn't permit it.

              When  the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an inter-
              nal DB instance with a DNS name that resolves to  a  private  IP
              address.

              For more information, see  CreateDBInstance .

              This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

          AutoMinorVersionUpgrade -> (boolean)
              A  value  that  indicates that minor version patches are applied
              automatically.

              This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

          MonitoringInterval -> (integer)
              The interval, in seconds, between points when Enhanced  Monitor-
              ing metrics are collected for the DB cluster.

              This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

          MonitoringRoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS to send Enhanced Moni-
              toring metrics to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

              This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

          PerformanceInsightsEnabled -> (boolean)
              True if Performance Insights is enabled for the DB cluster,  and
              otherwise false.

              This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

          PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Web  Services  KMS key identifier for encryption of
              Performance Insights data.

              The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key  ARN,  key
              ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

              This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

          PerformanceInsightsRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              The  amount  of  time,  in  days, to retain Performance Insights
              data. Valid values are 7 or 731 (2 years).
