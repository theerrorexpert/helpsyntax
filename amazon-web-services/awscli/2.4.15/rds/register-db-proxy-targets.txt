       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            register-db-proxy-targets
          --db-proxy-name <value>
          [--target-group-name <value>]
          [--db-instance-identifiers <value>]
          [--db-cluster-identifiers <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-proxy-name (string)
          The identifier of the DBProxy that is associated with  the  DBProxy-
          TargetGroup .

       --target-group-name (string)
          The identifier of the DBProxyTargetGroup .

       --db-instance-identifiers (list)
          One or more DB instance identifiers.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --db-cluster-identifiers (list)
          One or more DB cluster identifiers.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DBProxyTargets -> (list)
          One or more DBProxyTarget objects that are created when you register
          targets with a target group.

          (structure)
              Contains the details for an RDS Proxy target. It  represents  an
              RDS  DB instance or Aurora DB cluster that the proxy can connect
              to. One or more targets are associated with an RDS Proxy  target
              group.

              This   data   type   is  used  as  a  response  element  in  the
              DescribeDBProxyTargets action.

              TargetArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the  RDS  DB  instance  or
                 Aurora DB cluster.

              Endpoint -> (string)
                 The  writer  endpoint  for  the  RDS DB instance or Aurora DB
                 cluster.

              TrackedClusterId -> (string)
                 The DB cluster  identifier  when  the  target  represents  an
                 Aurora DB cluster. This field is blank when the target repre-
                 sents an RDS DB instance.

              RdsResourceId -> (string)
                 The  identifier  representing  the  target.  It  can  be  the
                 instance  identifier  for  an RDS DB instance, or the cluster
                 identifier for an Aurora DB cluster.

              Port -> (integer)
                 The port that the RDS Proxy uses to connect to the target RDS
                 DB instance or Aurora DB cluster.

              Type -> (string)
                 Specifies the kind of database, such as an RDS DB instance or
                 an Aurora DB cluster, that the target represents.

              Role -> (string)
                 A value that indicates whether the target of the proxy can be
                 used for read/write or read-only operations.

              TargetHealth -> (structure)
                 Information about the connection health of the RDS Proxy tar-
                 get.

                 State -> (string)
                     The current state of the connection health lifecycle  for
                     the  RDS Proxy target. The following is a typical lifecy-
                     cle example for the states of an RDS Proxy target:
                        registering > unavailable > available > unavailable  >
                        available

                 Reason -> (string)
                     The  reason for the current health State of the RDS Proxy
                     target.

                 Description -> (string)
                     A description of the health of the RDS Proxy  target.  If
                     the State is AVAILABLE , a description is not included.
