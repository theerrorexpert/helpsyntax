NAME
       describe-orderable-db-instance-options -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of orderable DB instance options for the specified DB
       engine, DB engine version, and DB instance class.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-orderable-db-instance-options is a paginated operation. Multi-
       ple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: OrderableDBInstanceOptions

       --engine-version (string)
          The engine version filter value. Specify this parameter to show only
          the available offerings matching the specified engine version.

       --db-instance-class (string)
          The  DB  instance class filter value. Specify this parameter to show
          only the available offerings  matching  the  specified  DB  instance
          class.

       --license-model (string)
          The  license model filter value. Specify this parameter to show only
          the available offerings matching the specified license model.

          RDS Custom supports only the BYOL licensing model.

       --availability-zone-group (string)
          The Availability Zone group associated with a  Local  Zone.  Specify
          this  parameter  to retrieve available offerings for the Local Zones
          in the group.

          Omit this parameter to show the available offerings in the specified
          Amazon Web Services Region.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --vpc | --no-vpc (boolean)
          A  value  that  indicates whether to show only VPC or non-VPC offer-
          ings. RDS Custom supports only VPC offerings.

          RDS Custom supports only VPC  offerings.  If  you  describe  non-VPC
          offerings for RDS Custom, the output shows VPC offerings.

       --filters (list)
          This parameter isn't currently supported.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              IDs. The filters supported by a  describe  operation  are  docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One  or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
