DESCRIBE-DB-CLUSTER-BACKTRACKS()              DESCRIBE-DB-CLUSTER-BACKTRACKS()



NAME
       describe-db-cluster-backtracks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about backtracks for a DB cluster.

       For  more  information  on Amazon Aurora, see What is Amazon Aurora? in
       the Amazon Aurora User Guide.

       NOTE:
          This action only applies to Aurora MySQL DB clusters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-db-cluster-backtracks is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: DBClusterBacktracks

SYNOPSIS
            describe-db-cluster-backtracks
          --db-cluster-identifier <value>
          [--backtrack-identifier <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  DB  cluster  identifier of the DB cluster to be described. This
          parameter is stored as a lowercase string.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain from 1 to 63 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.

          o First character must be a letter.

          o Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

          Example: my-cluster1

       --backtrack-identifier (string)
          If specified, this value is the backtrack identifier  of  the  back-
          track to be described.

          Constraints:

          o Must  contain  a  valid  universally unique identifier (UUID). For
            more information about UUIDs, see A Universally Unique  Identifier
            (UUID) URN Namespace .

          Example: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000

       --filters (list)
          A  filter  that  specifies one or more DB clusters to describe. Sup-
          ported filters include the following:

          o db-cluster-backtrack-id  -  Accepts  backtrack  identifiers.   The
            results  list includes information about only the backtracks iden-
            tified by these identifiers.

          o db-cluster-backtrack-status - Accepts any of the  following  back-
            track status values:

            o applying

            o completed

            o failed

            o pending

          The  results  list  includes  information  about only the backtracks
          identified by these values.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              IDs.  The  filters  supported  by a describe operation are docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are  case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          A pagination token that can be used in  a  later  DescribeDBCluster-
          Backtracks request.

       DBClusterBacktracks -> (list)
          Contains a list of backtracks for the user.

          (structure)
              This  data type is used as a response element in the DescribeDB-
              ClusterBacktracks action.

              DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
                 Contains a user-supplied DB cluster identifier. This  identi-
                 fier is the unique key that identifies a DB cluster.

              BacktrackIdentifier -> (string)
                 Contains the backtrack identifier.

              BacktrackTo -> (timestamp)
                 The  timestamp  of the time to which the DB cluster was back-
                 tracked.

              BacktrackedFrom -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp of the time from which the DB cluster was back-
                 tracked.

              BacktrackRequestCreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  timestamp  of  the  time  at  which  the  backtrack  was
                 requested.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the backtrack. This property returns one of the
                 following values:

                 o applying  -  The backtrack is currently being applied to or
                   rolled back from the DB cluster.

                 o completed - The backtrack has successfully been applied  to
                   or rolled back from the DB cluster.

                 o failed  - An error occurred while the backtrack was applied
                   to or rolled back from the DB cluster.

                 o pending - The backtrack is currently pending application to
                   or rollback from the DB cluster.
