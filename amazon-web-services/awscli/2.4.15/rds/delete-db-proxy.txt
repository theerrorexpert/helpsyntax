DELETE-DB-PROXY()                                            DELETE-DB-PROXY()



NAME
       delete-db-proxy -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes an existing DB proxy.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-db-proxy
          --db-proxy-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-proxy-name (string)
          The name of the DB proxy to delete.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DBProxy -> (structure)
          The data structure representing the details of the DB proxy that you
          delete.

          DBProxyName -> (string)
              The identifier for the proxy. This name must be unique  for  all

              fied Amazon Web Services Region.

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the proxy.

          Status -> (string)
              The current status of this proxy. A status  of  available  means
              the  proxy  is  ready  to handle requests. Other values indicate
              that you must wait for the proxy  to  be  ready,  or  take  some
              action to resolve an issue.

          EngineFamily -> (string)
              The  engine  family applies to MySQL and PostgreSQL for both RDS
              and Aurora.

          VpcId -> (string)
              Provides the VPC ID of the DB proxy.

          VpcSecurityGroupIds -> (list)
              Provides a list of VPC security groups that  the  proxy  belongs
              to.

              (string)

          VpcSubnetIds -> (list)
              The EC2 subnet IDs for the proxy.

              (string)

          Auth -> (list)
              One  or more data structures specifying the authorization mecha-
              nism to connect to the associated RDS DB instance or  Aurora  DB
              cluster.

              (structure)
                 Returns  the details of authentication used by a proxy to log
                 in as a specific database user.

                 Description -> (string)
                     A user-specified  description  about  the  authentication
                     used by a proxy to log in as a specific database user.

                 UserName -> (string)
                     The  name  of  the  database user to which the proxy con-
                     nects.

                 AuthScheme -> (string)
                     The type of authentication that the proxy uses  for  con-
                     nections from the proxy to the underlying database.

                 SecretArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) representing the secret
                     that the  proxy  uses  to  authenticate  to  the  RDS  DB
                     instance  or  Aurora DB cluster. These secrets are stored
                     within Amazon Secrets Manager.

                 IAMAuth -> (string)
                     Whether to require or disallow Amazon Web Services  Iden-
                     tity  and Access Management (IAM) authentication for con-
                     nections to the proxy.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the IAM role that  the  proxy
              uses to access Amazon Secrets Manager.

          Endpoint -> (string)
              The  endpoint  that  you can use to connect to the DB proxy. You
              include the endpoint value in the connection string for a  data-
              base client application.

          RequireTLS -> (boolean)
              Indicates  whether  Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption is
              required for connections to the proxy.

          IdleClientTimeout -> (integer)
              The number of seconds a connection to  the  proxy  can  have  no
              activity before the proxy drops the client connection. The proxy
              keeps the underlying database connection open and puts  it  back
              into the connection pool for reuse by later connection requests.

              Default: 1800 (30 minutes)

              Constraints: 1 to 28,800

          DebugLogging -> (boolean)
              Whether the proxy includes detailed information about SQL state-
              ments  in  its  logs. This information helps you to debug issues
              involving SQL behavior or the performance and scalability of the
              proxy  connections.  The  debug information includes the text of
              SQL statements that you submit through  the  proxy.  Thus,  only
              enable this setting when needed for debugging, and only when you
              have security measures  in  place  to  safeguard  any  sensitive
              information that appears in the logs.

          CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the proxy was first created.

          UpdatedDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the proxy was last updated.
