NAME
       describe-db-cluster-endpoints -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about endpoints for an Amazon Aurora DB cluster.

       NOTE:
          This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-db-cluster-endpoints  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: DBClusterEndpoints

SYNOPSIS
            describe-db-cluster-endpoints
          [--db-cluster-identifier <value>]
          [--db-cluster-endpoint-identifier <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The DB cluster identifier of the DB cluster associated with the end-
          point. This parameter is stored as a lowercase string.

       --db-cluster-endpoint-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the endpoint to describe. This parameter is stored
          as a lowercase string.

       --filters (list)
          A set of name-value pairs that define which endpoints to include  in
          the  output.  The  filters are specified as name-value pairs, in the
          format    Name=*endpoint_type*    ,Values=*endpoint_type1*    ,*end-
          point_type2*  ,...  . Name can be one of: db-cluster-endpoint-type ,
          db-cluster-endpoint-custom-type , db-cluster-endpoint-id ,  db-clus-
          ter-endpoint-status . Values for the db-cluster-endpoint-type filter
          can be one or more of: reader , writer , custom  .  Values  for  the
          db-cluster-endpoint-custom-type filter can be one or more of: reader
          , any . Values for the db-cluster-endpoint-status filter can be  one
          or more of: available , creating , deleting , inactive , modifying .

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              IDs.  The  filters  supported  by a describe operation are docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are  case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To describe DB cluster endpoints

       The following describe-db-cluster-endpoints example  retrieves  details
       for your DB cluster endpoints. The most common kinds of Aurora clusters
       have two endpoints. One endpoint has type WRITER. You can use this end-
       point  for  all SQL statements. The other endpoint has type READER. You
       can use this endpoint only for SELECT and other  read-only  SQL  state-
       ments.

          aws rds describe-db-cluster-endpoints

       Output:

          {
              "DBClusterEndpoints": [
                  {
                      "DBClusterIdentifier": "my-database-1",
                      "Endpoint": "my-database-1.cluster-cnpexample.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
                      "Status": "creating",
                      "EndpointType": "WRITER"
                  },
                  {
                      "DBClusterIdentifier": "my-database-1",
                      "Endpoint": "my-database-1.cluster-ro-cnpexample.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
                      "Status": "creating",
                      "EndpointType": "READER"
                  },
                  {
                      "DBClusterIdentifier": "mydbcluster",
                      "Endpoint": "mydbcluster.cluster-cnpexamle.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
                      "Status": "available",
                      "EndpointType": "WRITER"
                  },
                  {
                      "DBClusterIdentifier": "mydbcluster",
                      "Endpoint": "mydbcluster.cluster-ro-cnpexample.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
                      "Status": "available",
                      "EndpointType": "READER"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Example 2: To describe DB cluster endpoints of a single DB cluster

       The  following  describe-db-cluster-endpoints example retrieves details
       for the DB cluster endpoints of a single specified DB  cluster.  Aurora
       Serverless  clusters have only a single endpoint with a type of WRITER.

          aws rds describe-db-cluster-endpoints \
              --db-cluster-identifier serverless-cluster

       Output:

          {
              "DBClusterEndpoints": [
                  {
                      "Status": "available",
                      "Endpoint": "serverless-cluster.cluster-cnpexample.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
                      "DBClusterIdentifier": "serverless-cluster",
                      "EndpointType": "WRITER"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Amazon Aurora User Guide.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          An  optional pagination token provided by a previous DescribeDBClus-
          terEndpoints request. If this parameter is specified,  the  response
          includes  only  records beyond the marker, up to the value specified
          by MaxRecords .

       DBClusterEndpoints -> (list)
          Contains the details of the endpoints associated  with  the  cluster
          and matching any filter conditions.

          (structure)
              This data type represents the information you need to connect to
              an Amazon Aurora DB  cluster.  This  data  type  is  used  as  a
              response element in the following actions:

              o CreateDBClusterEndpoint

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o ModifyDBClusterEndpoint

              o DeleteDBClusterEndpoint

              For  the  data  structure that represents Amazon RDS DB instance
              endpoints, see Endpoint .

              DBClusterEndpointIdentifier -> (string)
                 The identifier associated with the endpoint.  This  parameter
                 is stored as a lowercase string.

              DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
                 The  DB  cluster identifier of the DB cluster associated with
                 the endpoint. This parameter is stored as a lowercase string.

              DBClusterEndpointResourceIdentifier -> (string)
                 A  unique  system-generated  identifier  for  an endpoint. It
                 remains the same for the whole life of the endpoint.

                 The current status of the endpoint. One of: creating , avail-
                 able  ,  deleting , inactive , modifying . The inactive state
                 applies to an endpoint that can't be used for a certain  kind
                 of  cluster,  such  as a writer endpoint for a read-only sec-
                 ondary cluster in a global database.

              EndpointType -> (string)
                 The type of the endpoint. One of: READER , WRITER , CUSTOM  .

                 WRITER , ANY .

              StaticMembers -> (list)
                 List of DB instance identifiers that are part of  the  custom
                 endpoint group.

                 (string)

              ExcludedMembers -> (list)
                 List  of DB instance identifiers that aren't part of the cus-
                 tom endpoint group. All other eligible instances  are  reach-
                 able  through  the custom endpoint. Only relevant if the list
                 of static members is empty.

                 (string)

              DBClusterEndpointArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the endpoint.
