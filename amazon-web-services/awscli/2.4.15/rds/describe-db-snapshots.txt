NAME
       describe-db-snapshots -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about DB snapshots. This API action supports pagi-
       nation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-db-snapshots is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: DBSnapshots

          [--db-instance-identifier <value>]
          [--db-snapshot-identifier <value>]
          [--snapshot-type <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--include-shared | --no-include-shared]
          [--include-public | --no-include-public]
          [--dbi-resource-id <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-instance-identifier (string)
          The  ID of the DB instance to retrieve the list of DB snapshots for.
          This parameter can't be used in conjunction  with  DBSnapshotIdenti-
          fier . This parameter isn't case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o If  supplied, must match the identifier of an existing DBInstance.

       --db-snapshot-identifier (string)
          A specific DB snapshot identifier to describe. This parameter  can't
          be  used  in  conjunction  with DBInstanceIdentifier . This value is
          stored as a lowercase string.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match the identifier of an existing  DBSnapshot.

          o If  this identifier is for an automated snapshot, the SnapshotType
            parameter must also be specified.

       --snapshot-type (string)
          The type of snapshots to be returned. You can  specify  one  of  the
          following values:

          o automated  -  Return all DB snapshots that have been automatically
            taken by Amazon RDS for my Amazon Web Services account.

          o manual - Return all DB snapshots that have been taken by my Amazon
            Web Services account.

          o shared  -  Return all manual DB snapshots that have been shared to
            my Amazon Web Services account.

          o public - Return all DB snapshots that have been marked as  public.

          o awsbackup - Return the DB snapshots managed by the Amazon Web Ser-
            vices Backup service. For information about  Amazon  Web  Services
            Backup,  see  the  `  Amazon  Web Services Backup Developer Guide.
            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/whatisbackup.html`__
            The awsbackup type does not apply to Aurora.

          If  you  don't specify a SnapshotType value, then both automated and
          manual snapshots are returned. Shared and public  DB  snapshots  are
          not  included  in  the  returned results by default. You can include
          shared snapshots with these results by  enabling  the  IncludeShared
          parameter.  You  can  include public snapshots with these results by
          enabling the IncludePublic parameter.

          The IncludeShared and IncludePublic parameters don't apply for Snap-
          shotType values of manual or automated . The IncludePublic parameter
          doesn't apply when SnapshotType is set to shared . The IncludeShared
          parameter doesn't apply when SnapshotType is set to public .

       --filters (list)
          A filter that specifies one or more DB snapshots to describe.

          Supported filters:

          o db-instance-id  -  Accepts DB instance identifiers and DB instance
            Amazon Resource Names (ARNs).

          o db-snapshot-id - Accepts DB snapshot identifiers.

          o dbi-resource-id - Accepts identifiers of source DB instances.

          o snapshot-type - Accepts types of DB snapshots.

          o engine - Accepts names of database engines.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              IDs.  The  filters  supported  by a describe operation are docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are  case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --include-shared | --no-include-shared (boolean)
          A  value  that indicates whether to include shared manual DB cluster
          snapshots from other Amazon Web Services accounts that  this  Amazon
          Web  Services  account has been given permission to copy or restore.
          By default, these snapshots are not included.

          You can give an Amazon Web Services account permission to restore  a
          manual DB snapshot from another Amazon Web Services account by using
          the ModifyDBSnapshotAttribute API action.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --include-public | --no-include-public (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to include manual  DB  cluster  snap-
          shots  that  are  public and can be copied or restored by any Amazon
          Web Services account. By  default,  the  public  snapshots  are  not
          included.

          You can share a manual DB snapshot as public by using the  ModifyDB-
          SnapshotAttribute API.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --dbi-resource-id (string)
          A specific DB resource ID to describe.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       Guide.

       Example 2: To find the number of manual snapshots taken

       The following describe-db-snapshots example uses the length operator in
       the --query option to return the number of manual snapshots  that  have
       been taken in a particular AWS Region.

          aws rds describe-db-snapshots \
              --snapshot-type manual \
              --query "length(*[].{DBSnapshots:SnapshotType})" \
              --region eu-central-1

       Output:

          35

                 The  number  of  CPU cores and the number of threads per core
                 for the DB instance class of the  DB  instance  when  the  DB
                 snapshot was created.

                 (structure)
                     Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

                     To  specify  the  number  of CPU cores, use the coreCount
                     feature name for the Name parameter. To specify the  num-
                     ber  of  threads per core, use the threadsPerCore feature
                     name for the Name parameter.

                     You can set the processor features  of  the  DB  instance
                     class  for a DB instance when you call one of the follow-
                     ing actions:

                     o CreateDBInstance

                     o ModifyDBInstance

                     o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

                     o RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

                     o RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime

                     You can view the valid processor values for a  particular
                     instance  class  by  calling  the  DescribeOrderableDBIn-
                     stanceOptions action and specifying  the  instance  class
                     for the DBInstanceClass parameter.

                     In  addition,  you  can  use the following actions for DB
                     instance class processor information:

                     o DescribeDBInstances

                     o DescribeDBSnapshots

                     o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

                     If  you  call  DescribeDBInstances   ,   ProcessorFeature
                     returns  non-null values only if the following conditions
                     are met:

                     o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

                     o Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring  the
                       number of CPU cores and threads per core.

                     o The  current  number  CPU cores and threads is set to a
                       non-default value.

                     For more information, see Configuring  the  Processor  of
                     the DB Instance Class in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The  name  of  the  processor feature. Valid names are
                        coreCount and threadsPerCore .

                     Value -> (string)
