NAME
       download-db-log-file-portion -

DESCRIPTION

       size.

       This command doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       download-db-log-file-portion is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: LogFileData

SYNOPSIS
            download-db-log-file-portion
          --db-instance-identifier <value>
          --log-file-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-instance-identifier (string)
          The  customer-assigned name of the DB instance that contains the log
          files you want to list.

          Constraints:

          o Must match the identifier of an existing DBInstance.

       --log-file-name (string)
          The name of the log file to be downloaded.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To download a DB log file

       The  following  download-db-log-file-portion example downloads only the
       latest part of your log file, saving it to a local file named tail.txt.

          aws rds download-db-log-file-portion \
              --db-instance-identifier test-instance \
              --log-file-name log.txt \
              --output text > tail.txt

       To download the entire file, you need to include the --starting-token 0
       parameter. The following example saves the output to a local file named
       full.txt.

          aws rds download-db-log-file-portion \
              --db-instance-identifier test-instance \
              --log-file-name log.txt \
              --starting-token 0 \
              --output text > full.txt

       The  saved  file  might contain blank lines.  They appear at the end of
       each part of the log  file  while  being  downloaded.   This  generally
       doesn't cause any trouble in your log file analysis.

OUTPUT
       LogFileData -> (string)
          Entries from the specified log file.

       Marker -> (string)
          A pagination token that can be used in a later DownloadDBLogFilePor-
          tion request.

       AdditionalDataPending -> (boolean)
          Boolean value that if true, indicates there is more data to be down-
          loaded.
