DESCRIBE-ACCOUNT-ATTRIBUTES()                    DESCRIBE-ACCOUNT-ATTRIBUTES()



NAME
       describe-account-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  of  the  attributes  for a customer account. The attributes
       include Amazon RDS quotas for the account, such as  the  number  of  DB
       instances allowed. The description for a quota includes the quota name,
       current usage toward that quota, and the quota's maximum value.

       This command doesn't take any parameters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-account-attributes
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AccountQuotas -> (list)
          A  list  of AccountQuota objects. Within this list, each quota has a
          name, a count of usage toward the quota maximum, and a maximum value
          for the quota.

          (structure)
              Describes a quota for an Amazon Web Services account.

              The following are account quotas:

              o DBClusterParameterGroups  - The number of DB cluster parameter
                groups per account, excluding default  parameter  groups.  The

              o DBClusters - The number of DB clusters per account.  The  used
                value is the count of DB clusters in the account.

                instance. The used value is the highest number  of  associated
                IAM roles for a DB instance in the account. Other DB instances

                group. The used value is highest number of subnets  for  a  DB
