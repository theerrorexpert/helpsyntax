RESTORE-DB-INSTANCE-FROM-DB-SNAPSHOT()  RESTORE-DB-INSTANCE-FROM-DB-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new  DB instance from a DB snapshot. The target database is
       created from the  source  database  restore  point  with  most  of  the
       source's  original  configuration, including the default security group
       and DB parameter group. By default, the new DB instance is created as a
       Single-AZ deployment, except when the instance is a SQL Server instance
       that has an option group associated with mirroring. In this  case,  the
       instance becomes a Multi-AZ deployment, not a Single-AZ deployment.

       If you want to replace your original DB instance with the new, restored
       DB instance, then rename your original DB instance before you call  the
       RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot   action.  RDS  doesn't  allow  two  DB
       instances with the same name. After you have renamed your  original  DB
       instance  with  a  different identifier, then you can pass the original
       name of the DB instance as the DBInstanceIdentifier in the call to  the
       RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot  action. The result is that you replace
       the original DB instance with the DB instance created  from  the  snap-
       shot.

       If you are restoring from a shared manual DB snapshot, the DBSnapshotI-
       dentifier must be the ARN of the shared DB snapshot.

       NOTE:
          This command doesn't apply to Aurora MySQL  and  Aurora  PostgreSQL.
          For Aurora, use RestoreDBClusterFromSnapshot .

OPTIONS
       --db-instance-identifier (string)
          Name of the DB instance to create from the DB snapshot. This parame-
          ter isn't case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain from 1 to 63 numbers, letters, or hyphens

          o First character must be a letter

          o Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens

          Example: my-snapshot-id

       --db-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier for the DB snapshot to restore from.

          Constraints:

          o Must match the identifier of an existing DBSnapshot.

          o If you are restoring from a shared manual DB snapshot, the DBSnap-
            shotIdentifier must be the ARN of the shared DB snapshot.

       --db-instance-class (string)
          The  compute  and memory capacity of the Amazon RDS DB instance, for
          example db.m4.large. Not all DB instance classes  are  available  in
          all  Amazon  Web  Services Regions, or for all database engines. For
          the full list of DB instance  classes,  and  availability  for  your
          engine, see DB Instance Class in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

          Default: The same DBInstanceClass as the original DB instance.

       --port (integer)
          The port number on which the database accepts connections.

          Default: The same port as the original DB instance

          Constraints: Value must be 1150-65535

       --availability-zone (string)
          The Availability Zone (AZ) where the DB instance will be created.

          Default: A random, system-chosen Availability Zone.

          Constraint:  You can't specify the AvailabilityZone parameter if the
          DB instance is a Multi-AZ deployment.

          Example: us-east-1a

       --db-subnet-group-name (string)
          The DB subnet group name to use for the new instance.

          Constraints: If supplied, must match the name of an existing  DBSub-
          netGroup.

          Example: mySubnetgroup

       --multi-az | --no-multi-az (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether the DB instance is a Multi-AZ deploy-
          ment.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Constraint: You can't specify the AvailabilityZone parameter if  the
          DB instance is a Multi-AZ deployment.

       --publicly-accessible | --no-publicly-accessible (boolean)
          A  value that indicates whether the DB instance is publicly accessi-
          ble.

          When the DB instance is publicly accessible, its Domain Name  System
          (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB
          instance's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP
          address  from  outside  of  the  DB instance's VPC. Access to the DB
          instance is ultimately controlled by the  security  group  it  uses.
          That  public  access is not permitted if the security group assigned
          to the DB instance doesn't permit it.

          When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB
          instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

          For more information, see  CreateDBInstance .

       --auto-minor-version-upgrade      |     --no-auto-minor-version-upgrade
       (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether minor version  upgrades  are  applied
          automatically to the DB instance during the maintenance window.

          If  you  restore  an  RDS  Custom DB instance, you must disable this
          parameter.

       --license-model (string)
          License model information for the restored DB instance.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Default: Same as source.

          Valid  values:  license-included  |  bring-your-own-license  |  gen-
          eral-public-license

       --db-name (string)
          The database name for the restored DB instance.

          This  parameter  doesn't  apply to the MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MariaDB
          engines. It also doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

       --engine (string)
          The database engine to use for the new instance.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Default: The same as source

          Constraint: Must be compatible with the engine of  the  source.  For
          example, you can restore a MariaDB 10.1 DB instance from a MySQL 5.6
          snapshot.

          Valid Values:

          o mariadb

          o mysql

          o oracle-ee

          o oracle-ee-cdb

          o oracle-se2

          o oracle-se2-cdb

          o postgres

          o sqlserver-ee

          o sqlserver-se

          o sqlserver-ex

          o sqlserver-web

       --iops (integer)
          Specifies the amount  of  provisioned  IOPS  for  the  DB  instance,
          expressed  in  I/O  operations  per  second. If this parameter isn't
          specified, the IOPS value is taken from the backup. If this  parame-
          ter  is  set  to  0,  the  new  instance is converted to a non-PIOPS
          instance. The conversion  takes  additional  time,  though  your  DB
          instance  is available for connections before the conversion starts.

          The provisioned IOPS value must follow  the  requirements  for  your
          database  engine.  For  more information, see Amazon RDS Provisioned
          IOPS Storage to Improve Performance in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

          Constraints: Must be an integer greater than 1000.

       --option-group-name (string)
          The name of the  option  group  to  be  used  for  the  restored  DB
          instance.

          Permanent  options, such as the TDE option for Oracle Advanced Secu-
          rity TDE, can't be removed from an option  group,  and  that  option
          group  can't  be  removed  from a DB instance after it is associated
          with a DB instance.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --tags (list)
          A list of  tags.  For  more  information,  see  Tagging  Amazon  RDS

              Value -> (string)
                 A  value  is  the optional value of the tag. The string value
                 can be from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length  and  can't
                 be  prefixed  with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain
                 only the set of Unicode letters,  digits,  white-space,  '_',
                 '.',   ':',   '/',   '=',   '+',   '-',   '@'   (Java  regex:

       --processor-features (list)
          The number of CPU cores and the number of threads per core  for  the
          DB instance class of the DB instance.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          (structure)
              Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

              To  specify  the  number of CPU cores, use the coreCount feature
              name for the Name parameter. To specify the  number  of  threads
              per  core,  use  the  threadsPerCore  feature  name for the Name
              parameter.

              You can set the processor features of the DB instance class  for
              a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

              o CreateDBInstance

              o ModifyDBInstance

              o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

              o RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

              You  can  view  the  valid  processor  values  for  a particular
              instance class by calling the DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions
              action and specifying the instance class for the DBInstanceClass
              parameter.

              In addition, you can use the following actions for  DB  instance

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribeDBSnapshots

              o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

              If  you  call  DescribeDBInstances  ,  ProcessorFeature  returns
              non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

              o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

              o Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the  number
                of CPU cores and threads per core.

              o The  current  number  CPU  cores  and  threads  is  set  to  a
                non-default value.

              For more information, see Configuring the Processor  of  the  DB
              Instance Class in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name of the processor feature. Valid names are coreCount
                 and threadsPerCore .

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of a processor feature name.

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --use-default-processor-features |  --no-use-default-processor-features
       (boolean)
          A  value  that  indicates  whether  the  DB instance class of the DB
          instance uses its default processor features.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --db-parameter-group-name (string)
          The name of the  DB  parameter  group  to  associate  with  this  DB
          instance.

          If  you  don't  specify  a value for DBParameterGroupName , then RDS
          uses the default DBParameterGroup for the specified DB engine.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match the name of an existing  DBParameterGroup.

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          A  value that indicates whether the DB instance has deletion protec-
          tion enabled. The database can't be deleted when deletion protection
          is  enabled. By default, deletion protection isn't enabled. For more
          information, see Deleting a DB Instance .

       --enable-customer-owned-ip | --no-enable-customer-owned-ip (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to enable a customer-owned IP address
          (CoIP) for an RDS on Outposts DB instance.

          A  CoIP provides local or external connectivity to resources in your
          Outpost subnets through  your  on-premises  network.  For  some  use
          cases,  a  CoIP  can provide lower latency for connections to the DB
          instance from outside of its virtual private  cloud  (VPC)  on  your
          local network.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          For  more information about RDS on Outposts, see Working with Amazon
          RDS on Amazon Web Services Outposts in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          For more information about CoIPs, see Customer-owned IP addresses in
          the Amazon Web Services Outposts User Guide .

       --custom-iam-instance-profile (string)
          The  instance  profile  associated  with  the  underlying Amazon EC2
          instance of an RDS Custom DB instance.  The  instance  profile  must
          meet the following requirements:

          o The profile must exist in your account.

          o The  profile must have an IAM role that Amazon EC2 has permissions
            to assume.

          o The instance profile name and the associated IAM  role  name  must
            start with the prefix AWSRDSCustom .

          For the list of permissions required for the IAM role, see Configure
          IAM and your VPC in the  Amazon  Relational  Database  Service  User
          Guide .

          This setting is required for RDS Custom.

       --backup-target (string)
          Specifies  where  automated  backups and manual snapshots are stored
          for the restored DB instance.

          Possible values are outposts  (Amazon  Web  Services  Outposts)  and
          region (Amazon Web Services Region). The default is region .

          For more information, see Working with Amazon RDS on Amazon Web Ser-
          vices Outposts in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To restore a DB instance from a DB snapshot

       The following restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot  example  creates  a
       new DB instance named db7-new-instance with the db.t3.small DB instance
       class from the specified DB snapshot. The source DB instance from which
       the  snapshot  was  taken  uses  a deprecated DB instance class, so you
       can't upgrade it.

          aws rds restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot \
              --db-instance-identifier db7-new-instance \
              --db-snapshot-identifier db7-test-snapshot \
              --db-instance-class db.t3.small

       Output:

                     stanceOptions action and specifying  the  instance  class
                     for the DBInstanceClass parameter.

                     In  addition,  you  can  use the following actions for DB
                     instance class processor information:

                     o DescribeDBInstances

                     o DescribeDBSnapshots

                     o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

              DB  instance,  the  Aurora  MySQL DB cluster for the Aurora read
              replica is shown. This output doesn't contain information  about
              cross-Region Aurora read replicas.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, each RDS DB instance can have only one Aurora read
                 replica.

                     The  status of the DB instance's option group membership.
                     Valid  values  are:  in-sync  ,  pending-apply  ,   pend-
                     ing-removal , pending-maintenance-apply , pending-mainte-
                     nance-removal , applying , removing , and failed .

          CharacterSetName -> (string)
              If present, specifies the name of the character  set  that  this
              instance is associated with.

          NcharCharacterSetName -> (string)
              The  name of the NCHAR character set for the Oracle DB instance.
              This character set  specifies  the  Unicode  encoding  for  data

          PubliclyAccessible -> (boolean)
              Specifies the accessibility options for the DB instance.

              When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name Sys-
              tem  (DNS)  endpoint  resolves  to  the  private IP address from
              within the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves
              to  the  public IP address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC.
              Access to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by  the  secu-
              rity  group  it  uses. That public access isn't permitted if the
              security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it.

              When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an  inter-
              nal  DB  instance  with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP
              address.
