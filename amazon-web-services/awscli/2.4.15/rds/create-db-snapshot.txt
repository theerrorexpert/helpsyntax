NAME
       create-db-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a snapshot of a DB instance. The source DB instance must be in
       the available or storage-optimization state.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-db-snapshot
          --db-snapshot-identifier <value>
          --db-instance-identifier <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier for the DB snapshot.

          Constraints:

          o Can't be null, empty, or blank

          o Must contain from 1 to 255 letters, numbers, or hyphens

          o First character must be a letter

          o Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens

          Example: my-snapshot-id

       --db-instance-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the DB instance that you want to create the  snap-
          shot of.

          Constraints:

          o Must match the identifier of an existing DBInstance.

       --tags (list)
          A  list  of  tags.  For  more  information,  see  Tagging Amazon RDS
          Resources in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

          (structure)
              Metadata assigned to an Amazon  RDS  resource  consisting  of  a
              key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 A  key  is the required name of the tag. The string value can
                 be from 1 to 128 Unicode characters in length  and  can't  be
                 prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain only
                 the set of Unicode letters, digits,  white-space,  '_',  '.',
                 ':',    '/',    '=',    '+',    '-',    '@'    (Java   regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A value is the optional value of the tag.  The  string  value
                 can  be  from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length and can't
                 be prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can  only  contain
                 only  the  set  of Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_',
                 '.',  ':',   '/',   '=',   '+',   '-',   '@'   (Java   regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

              with a time zone specified.

          IAMDatabaseAuthenticationEnabled -> (boolean)
              True  if mapping of Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Man-
              agement (IAM) accounts to database accounts is enabled, and oth-
              erwise false.

          ProcessorFeatures -> (list)
              The  number  of CPU cores and the number of threads per core for
              the DB instance class of the DB instance when  the  DB  snapshot
              was created.

              (structure)
                 Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

                 To specify the number of CPU cores, use the coreCount feature
                 name for the Name parameter. To specify the number of threads
                 per  core,  use  the threadsPerCore feature name for the Name
                 parameter.

                 You can set the processor features of the DB  instance  class
                 for a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

                 o CreateDBInstance

                 o ModifyDBInstance

                 o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

                 o RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

                 o RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime

                 You can view the valid  processor  values  for  a  particular
                 instance  class by calling the DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOp-
                 tions action and specifying the instance class for the  DBIn-
                 stanceClass parameter.

                 In  addition,  you  can  use  the  following  actions  for DB
                 instance class processor information:

                 o DescribeDBInstances

                 o DescribeDBSnapshots

                 o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

                 If you call DescribeDBInstances  ,  ProcessorFeature  returns
                 non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

                 o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

                 o Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the num-
                   ber of CPU cores and threads per core.

                 o The current number CPU  cores  and  threads  is  set  to  a
                   non-default value.

                 For more information, see Configuring the Processor of the DB
                 Instance Class in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name of the processor feature. Valid names are  core-
                     Count and threadsPerCore .

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value of a processor feature name.

          DbiResourceId -> (string)
              The  identifier  for  the  source  DB  instance,  which can't be
              changed and which is unique to an Amazon Web Services Region.

          TagList -> (list)
              A list of tags. For more information,  see  Tagging  Amazon  RDS
              Resources in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

                 Metadata  assigned  to an Amazon RDS resource consisting of a
                 key-value pair.

                 Key -> (string)
                     A key is the required name of the tag. The  string  value
                     can  be  from  1  to 128 Unicode characters in length and
                     can't be prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can only
                     contain   only   the  set  of  Unicode  letters,  digits,
                     white-space, '_', '.', ':', '/', '=', '+', '-', '@' (Java
                     regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

                 Value -> (string)
                     A  value  is  the  optional  value of the tag. The string
                     value can be from 1 to 256 Unicode characters  in  length
                     and  can't be prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can
                     only contain only the set  of  Unicode  letters,  digits,

                     regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

          OriginalSnapshotCreateTime -> (timestamp)
              Specifies the time of the CreateDBSnapshot operation in  Coordi-
              nated  Universal Time (UTC). Doesn't change when the snapshot is
              copied.

          SnapshotTarget -> (string)
