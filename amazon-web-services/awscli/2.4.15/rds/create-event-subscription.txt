CREATE-EVENT-SUBSCRIPTION()                        CREATE-EVENT-SUBSCRIPTION()



NAME
       create-event-subscription -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an RDS event notification subscription. This action requires a
       topic Amazon Resource Name (ARN) created by either the RDS console, the
       SNS console, or the SNS API. To obtain an ARN with SNS, you must create
       a topic in Amazon SNS and subscribe to the topic. The ARN is  displayed
       in the SNS console.

       You  can  specify  the type of source (SourceType ) that you want to be
       notified of and provide a list of RDS sources (SourceIds )  that  trig-
       gers  the  events.  You  can  also  provide  a list of event categories
       (EventCategories ) for events that you want  to  be  notified  of.  For
       example, you can specify SourceType = db-instance , SourceIds = mydbin-
       stance1 , mydbinstance2 and EventCategories = Availability , Backup .

       If you specify both the SourceType and SourceIds , such as SourceType =
       db-instance and SourceIds = myDBInstance1 , you are notified of all the
       db-instance events for the specified source. If you specify  a  Source-
       Type  but  do  not specify SourceIds , you receive notice of the events
       for that source type for all your RDS sources.  If  you  don't  specify
       either  the  SourceType  or  the SourceIds , you are notified of events
       generated from all RDS sources belonging to your customer account.

       NOTE:
          RDS event notification is only available for unencrypted SNS topics.
          If  you  specify  an encrypted SNS topic, event notifications aren't
          sent for the topic.

          --subscription-name <value>
          --sns-topic-arn <value>
          [--source-type <value>]
          [--event-categories <value>]
          [--source-ids <value>]
          [--enabled | --no-enabled]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subscription-name (string)
          The name of the subscription.

          Constraints: The name must be less than 255 characters.

       --sns-topic-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SNS topic  created  for  event
          notification.  The  ARN  is  created by Amazon SNS when you create a
          topic and subscribe to it.

       --source-type (string)
          The type of source that is generating the events.  For  example,  if
          you  want  to  be notified of events generated by a DB instance, you
          set this parameter to db-instance . For RDS  Proxy  events,  specify
          db-proxy . If this value isn't specified, all events are returned.

          Valid  values:  db-instance  |  db-cluster  |  db-parameter-group  |
          db-security-group | db-snapshot | db-cluster-snapshot | db-proxy

       --event-categories (list)
          A list of event categories for a particular source type  (SourceType
          )  that  you  want  to subscribe to. You can see a list of the cate-
          gories for a given source type in the "Amazon RDS  event  categories
          and  event  messages"  section  of  the  `  Amazon  RDS  User  Guide
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Events.Messages.html`__
          or       the       `       Amazon       Aurora       User      Guide
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_Events.Messages.html`__
          .  You  can  also see this list by using the DescribeEventCategories
          operation.

          "string" "string" ...

       --source-ids (list)
          The list of identifiers of the event sources for  which  events  are
          returned.  If  not  specified,  then all sources are included in the
          response. An identifier must begin with a letter  and  must  contain
          only  ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens. It can't end with a hyphen
          or contain two consecutive hyphens.

            must be supplied.

          o If the source type is a DB cluster snapshot, a DBClusterSnapshotI-
            dentifier value must be supplied.

          "string" "string" ...

       --enabled | --no-enabled (boolean)
          A  value that indicates whether to activate the subscription. If the
          event notification subscription isn't activated, the subscription is
          created but not active.

       --tags (list)
          A  list  of  tags.  For  more  information,  see  Tagging Amazon RDS
          Resources in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

          (structure)
              Metadata assigned to an Amazon  RDS  resource  consisting  of  a
              key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 A  key  is the required name of the tag. The string value can
                 be from 1 to 128 Unicode characters in length  and  can't  be
                 prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain only
                 the set of Unicode letters, digits,  white-space,  '_',  '.',
                 ':',    '/',    '=',    '+',    '-',    '@'    (Java   regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A value is the optional value of the tag.  The  string  value
                 can  be  from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length and can't
                 be prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can  only  contain
                 only  the  set  of Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_',
                 '.',  ':',   '/',   '=',   '+',   '-',   '@'   (Java   regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To create an event subscription

       The  following create-event-subscription example creates a subscription
       for backup and recovery events for DB  instances  in  the  current  AWS
       account.  Notifications  are sent to an Amazon Simple Notification Ser-
       vice topic, specified by --sns-topic-arn.

          aws rds create-event-subscription \
              --subscription-name my-instance-events \
              --source-type db-instance \
              --event-categories '["backup","recovery"]' \
              --sns-topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:interesting-events

       Output:

          {
              "EventSubscription": {
                  "Status": "creating",
                  "CustSubscriptionId": "my-instance-events",
                  "SubscriptionCreationTime": "Tue Jul 31 23:22:01 UTC 2018",
                  "EventCategoriesList": [
                      "backup",
                      "recovery"
                  ],
                  "SnsTopicArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:interesting-events",
                  "CustomerAwsId": "123456789012",
                  "EventSubscriptionArn": "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:es:my-instance-events",
                  "SourceType": "db-instance",
                  "Enabled": true
              }
          }
