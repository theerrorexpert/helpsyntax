OPTIONS
       --db-proxy-name (string)
          The identifier for the DBProxy to modify.

       --new-db-proxy-name (string)
          The new identifier for the DBProxy . An identifier must begin with a
          letter and must contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens;  it
          can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

       --auth (list)
          The new authentication settings for the DBProxy .

          (structure)
              Specifies  the  details of authentication used by a proxy to log
              in as a specific database user.

              Description -> (string)
                 A user-specified description about the authentication used by
                 a proxy to log in as a specific database user.

              UserName -> (string)
                 The name of the database user to which the proxy connects.

              AuthScheme -> (string)
                 The  type  of  authentication that the proxy uses for connec-
                 tions from the proxy to the underlying database.

              SecretArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) representing the  secret  that
                 the  proxy  uses  to  authenticate  to the RDS DB instance or
                 Aurora DB cluster. These secrets  are  stored  within  Amazon
                 Secrets Manager.

              IAMAuth -> (string)
                 Whether  to  require or disallow Amazon Web Services Identity
                 and Access Management (IAM) authentication for connections to
                 the proxy.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Description=string,UserName=string,AuthScheme=string,SecretArn=string,IAMAuth=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Description": "string",
              "UserName": "string",
              "AuthScheme": "SECRETS",
              "SecretArn": "string",
              "IAMAuth": "DISABLED"|"REQUIRED"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --require-tls | --no-require-tls (boolean)
          Whether  Transport  Layer  Security (TLS) encryption is required for
          connections to the proxy. By enabling this setting, you can  enforce
          encrypted TLS connections to the proxy, even if the associated data-
          base doesn't use TLS.

       --idle-client-timeout (integer)
          The number of seconds that a connection to the proxy can be inactive
          before  the  proxy  disconnects it. You can set this value higher or
          lower than the connection timeout limit for the associated database.

       --debug-logging | --no-debug-logging (boolean)
          Whether the proxy includes detailed information about SQL statements
          in its logs. This information helps you to  debug  issues  involving
          SQL behavior or the performance and scalability of the proxy connec-
          tions. The debug information includes the  text  of  SQL  statements
          that  you  submit  through the proxy. Thus, only enable this setting
          when needed for debugging, and only when you have security  measures
          in  place to safeguard any sensitive information that appears in the
          logs.

       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that the  proxy  uses
          to access secrets in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager.

       --security-groups (list)
          The new list of security groups for the DBProxy .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 Returns the details of authentication used by a proxy to  log
                 in as a specific database user.

                 Description -> (string)
                     A  user-specified  description  about  the authentication
                     used by a proxy to log in as a specific database user.

                 UserName -> (string)
                     The name of the database user to  which  the  proxy  con-
                     nects.

                 AuthScheme -> (string)
                     The  type  of authentication that the proxy uses for con-
                     nections from the proxy to the underlying database.

                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  representing  the  secret
                     that  the  proxy  uses  to  authenticate  to  the  RDS DB
                     instance or Aurora DB cluster. These secrets  are  stored
                     within Amazon Secrets Manager.

                 IAMAuth -> (string)
                     Whether  to require or disallow Amazon Web Services Iden-
                     tity and Access Management (IAM) authentication for  con-

              The endpoint that you can use to connect to the  DB  proxy.  You
              include  the endpoint value in the connection string for a data-

          IdleClientTimeout -> (integer)
              The  number  of  seconds  a  connection to the proxy can have no
              activity before the proxy drops the client connection. The proxy
              keeps  the  underlying database connection open and puts it back
              into the connection pool for reuse by later connection requests.

              Default: 1800 (30 minutes)

              Constraints: 1 to 28,800

          DebugLogging -> (boolean)
              Whether the proxy includes detailed information about SQL state-
              ments in its logs. This information helps you  to  debug  issues
              involving SQL behavior or the performance and scalability of the
              proxy connections. The debug information includes  the  text  of
              SQL  statements  that  you  submit through the proxy. Thus, only
              enable this setting when needed for debugging, and only when you
              have  security  measures  in  place  to  safeguard any sensitive
              information that appears in the logs.

          CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the proxy was first created.

          UpdatedDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the proxy was last updated.
