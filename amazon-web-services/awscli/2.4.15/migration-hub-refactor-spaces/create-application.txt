CREATE-APPLICATION()                                      CREATE-APPLICATION()



NAME
       create-application -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  Amazon Web Services Migration Hub Refactor Spaces applica-
       tion. The account that owns the environment also owns the  applications
       created  inside the environment, regardless of the account that creates
       the application. Refactor Spaces provisions the Amazon API Gateway  and
       Network Load Balancer for the application proxy inside your account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-application
          [--api-gateway-proxy <value>]
          [--client-token <value>]
          --environment-identifier <value>
          --name <value>
          --proxy-type <value>
          [--tags <value>]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --api-gateway-proxy (structure)
          A  wrapper  object  holding  the API Gateway endpoint type and stage
          name for the proxy.

          EndpointType -> (string)
              The type of endpoint to use for the API  Gateway  proxy.  If  no
              value  is specified in the request, the value is set to REGIONAL
              by default.

              If the value is set to PRIVATE in the request,  this  creates  a
              private  API endpoint that is isolated from the public internet.
              The private endpoint can only be accessed by using  Amazon  Vir-
              tual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) endpoints for Amazon API Gateway
              that have been granted access.

          StageName -> (string)
              The name of the API Gateway stage. The name defaults to prod .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          EndpointType=string,StageName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "EndpointType": "REGIONAL"|"PRIVATE",
            "StageName": "string"
          }

       --client-token (string)
          A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to  ensure  the
          idempotency of the request.

       --environment-identifier (string)
          The unique identifier of the environment.

       --name (string)
          The name to use for the application.

       --proxy-type (string)
          The proxy type of the proxy created within the application.

          Possible values:

          o API_GATEWAY

       --tags (map)
          The  tags  to  assign  to the application. A tag is a label that you
          assign to an Amazon Web Services resource. Each tag  consists  of  a
          key-value pair.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --vpc-id (string)
          The ID of the virtual private cloud (VPC).

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
