NAME
       create-environment -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  Amazon Web Services Migration Hub Refactor Spaces environ-
       ment. The caller owns the environment resource, and they  are  referred
       to  as  the environment owner . The environment owner has cross-account
       visibility and control of Refactor Spaces resources that are  added  to
       the  environment by other accounts that the environment is shared with.
       When creating an environment,  Refactor  Spaces  provisions  a  transit
       gateway in your account.

SYNOPSIS
            create-environment
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--description <value>]
          --name <value>
          --network-fabric-type <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request.

       --description (string)
          The description of the environment.

       --name (string)
          The name of the environment.

       --network-fabric-type (string)
          The network fabric type of the environment.

          Possible values:

          o TRANSIT_GATEWAY

       --tags (map)
          The tags to assign to the environment. A tag is  a  label  that  you
          assign  to  an  Amazon Web Services resource. Each tag consists of a
          key-value pair.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
