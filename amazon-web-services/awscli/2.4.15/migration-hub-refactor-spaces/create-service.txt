CREATE-SERVICE()                                              CREATE-SERVICE()



NAME
       create-service -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  Amazon Web Services Migration Hub Refactor Spaces service.
       The account owner of the  service  is  always  the  environment  owner,
       regardless  of  which  account  in the environment creates the service.
       Services have either a URL endpoint in a virtual private  cloud  (VPC),
       or a Lambda function endpoint.

       WARNING:
          If  an Amazon Web Services resourceis launched in a service VPC, and
          you want it to be accessible to all of an environments services with
          VPCs  and  routes,  apply  the  RefactorSpacesSecurityGroup  to  the
          resource. Alternatively,  to  add  more  cross-account  constraints,
          apply your own security group.

OPTIONS
       --application-identifier (string)
          The ID of the application which the service is created.

       --client-token (string)

          idempotency of the request.

       --description (string)
          The description of the service.

       --endpoint-type (string)
          The type of endpoint to use for the service. The type can be  a  URL
          in a VPC or an Lambda function.

          Possible values:

          o LAMBDA

          o URL

       --environment-identifier (string)
          The ID of the environment in which the service is created.

       --lambda-endpoint (structure)
          The configuration for the Lambda endpoint type.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Lambda endpoint.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Arn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Arn": "string"
          }

       --name (string)
          The name of the service.

       --tags (map)
          The  tags to assign to the service. A tag is a label that you assign
          to an Amazon Web Services resource. Each tag consists of a key-value
          pair..

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --url-endpoint (structure)
          The configuration for the URL endpoint type.

          HealthUrl -> (string)
              The  health  check URL of the URL endpoint type. If the URL is a
              public endpoint, the HealthUrl must also be a  public  endpoint.
              If  the URL is a private endpoint inside a virtual private cloud
              (VPC), the health URL must also be a private endpoint,  and  the
              host must be the same as the URL.

          Url -> (string)
              The   URL   to   route   traffic   to.   The   URL  must  be  an
              rfc3986-formatted URL . If the host is a domain name,  the  name
              must  be  resolvable  over the public internet. If the scheme is
              https , the top level domain of the host must be listed  in  the
              IANA root zone database .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          HealthUrl=string,Url=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "HealthUrl": "string",
            "Url": "string"
          }

       --vpc-id (string)
          The ID of the VPC.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
