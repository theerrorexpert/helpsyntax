NAME
       start-next-pending-job-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  and  starts  the  next pending (status IN_PROGRESS or QUEUED) job
       execution for a thing.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-next-pending-job-execution
          --thing-name <value>
          [--status-details <value>]
          [--step-timeout-in-minutes <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --thing-name (string)
          The name of the thing associated with the device.

       --status-details (map)
          A collection of name/value pairs that describe the status of the job
          execution. If not specified, the statusDetails are unchanged.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --step-timeout-in-minutes (long)
          Specifies  the amount of time this device has to finish execution of
          this job. If the job execution status is not set to a terminal state
          before  this timer expires, or before the timer is reset (by calling
          UpdateJobExecution , setting the status to IN_PROGRESS and  specify-
          ing a new timeout value in field stepTimeoutInMinutes ) the job exe-
          cution status will be automatically set to  TIMED_OUT  .  Note  that
          setting  this  timeout  has  no effect on that job execution timeout
          which may have been specified when the job  was  created  (CreateJob
          using field timeoutConfig ).

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get and start the next pending job execution for a thing

       The  following  start-next-pending-job-execution  example retrieves and
       starts the next job execution whose status is IN_PROGRESS or QUEUED for
       the specified thing.

          aws iot-jobs-data start-next-pending-job-execution \
              --thing-name MotionSensor1
              --endpoint-url https://1234567890abcd.jobs.iot.us-west-2.amazonaws.com

       Output:

          {
              "execution": {
                  "approximateSecondsBeforeTimedOut": 88,

OUTPUT
       execution -> (structure)
          A JobExecution object.

          jobId -> (string)
              The unique identifier you assigned to this job when it was  cre-
              ated.

          thingName -> (string)
              The name of the thing that is executing the job.

          status -> (string)
              The  status  of  the  job  execution.  Can  be one of: "QUEUED",
              "IN_PROGRESS", "FAILED", "SUCCESS", "CANCELED",  "REJECTED",  or
              "REMOVED".

          statusDetails -> (map)
              A collection of name/value pairs that describe the status of the
              job execution.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          queuedAt -> (long)
              The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the  job  execu-
              tion was enqueued.

          startedAt -> (long)
              The  time,  in milliseconds since the epoch, when the job execu-
              tion was started.

          lastUpdatedAt -> (long)
              The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the  job  execu-
              tion was last updated.

          approximateSecondsBeforeTimedOut -> (long)
              The  estimated number of seconds that remain before the job exe-
              cution status will be changed to TIMED_OUT .

          versionNumber -> (long)
              The version of the job execution.  Job  execution  versions  are
              incremented each time they are updated by a device.

          executionNumber -> (long)
              A number that identifies a particular job execution on a partic-
              ular device. It can be used later in  commands  that  return  or
              update job execution information.

          jobDocument -> (string)
              The content of the job document.
