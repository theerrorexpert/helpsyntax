NAME
       describe-job-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets details of a job execution.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-job-execution
          --job-id <value>
          --thing-name <value>
          [--include-job-document | --no-include-job-document]
          [--execution-number <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The unique identifier assigned to this job when it was created.

       --thing-name (string)
          The  thing name associated with the device the job execution is run-
          ning on.

       --include-job-document | --no-include-job-document (boolean)
          Optional. When set to true, the response contains the job  document.
          The default is false.

       --execution-number (long)
          Optional.  A  number that identifies a particular job execution on a
          particular device. If not specified, the  latest  job  execution  is
          returned.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the details of a job execution

       The  following  describe-job-execution example retrieves the details of
       the latest execution of the specified job and thing.

          aws iot-jobs-data describe-job-execution \
              --job-id SampleJob \
              --thing-name MotionSensor1 \
              --endpoint-url https://1234567890abcd.jobs.iot.us-west-2.amazonaws.com

       Output:

          {
              "execution": {
                  "approximateSecondsBeforeTimedOut": 88,
                  "executionNumber": 2939653338,
                  "jobId": "SampleJob",
                  "lastUpdatedAt": 1567701875.743,
                  "queuedAt": 1567701902.444,
                  "status": "QUEUED",
                  "thingName": "MotionSensor1 ",
                  "versionNumber": 3
             }
          }

OUTPUT
       execution -> (structure)
          Contains data about a job execution.

          jobId -> (string)
              The  unique identifier you assigned to this job when it was cre-
              ated.

          thingName -> (string)
              The name of the thing that is executing the job.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the  job  execution.  Can  be  one  of:  "QUEUED",
              "IN_PROGRESS",  "FAILED",  "SUCCESS", "CANCELED", "REJECTED", or
              "REMOVED".

          statusDetails -> (map)
              A collection of name/value pairs that describe the status of the
              job execution.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          queuedAt -> (long)
              The  time,  in milliseconds since the epoch, when the job execu-
              tion was enqueued.

          startedAt -> (long)
              The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the  job  execu-
              tion was started.

          lastUpdatedAt -> (long)
              The  time,  in milliseconds since the epoch, when the job execu-
              tion was last updated.

          approximateSecondsBeforeTimedOut -> (long)
              The estimated number of seconds that remain before the job  exe-
              cution status will be changed to TIMED_OUT .

          versionNumber -> (long)
              The  version  of  the  job execution. Job execution versions are
              incremented each time they are updated by a device.

          executionNumber -> (long)
              A number that identifies a particular job execution on a partic-
              ular  device.  It  can  be used later in commands that return or
              update job execution information.

          jobDocument -> (string)
              The content of the job document.
