GET-PENDING-JOB-EXECUTIONS()                      GET-PENDING-JOB-EXECUTIONS()



NAME
       get-pending-job-executions -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the  list of all jobs for a thing that are not in a terminal sta-
       tus.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-pending-job-executions
          --thing-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --thing-name (string)
          The name of the thing that is executing the job.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get a list of all jobs that are not in a terminal status for a thing

       The following get-pending-job-executions example displays a list of all
       jobs that aren't in a terminal state for the specified thing.

          aws iot-jobs-data get-pending-job-executions \
              --thing-name MotionSensor1
              --endpoint-url https://1234567890abcd.jobs.iot.us-west-2.amazonaws.com

       Output:

          {
              "inProgressJobs": [
              ],
              "queuedJobs": [
                  {
                      "executionNumber": 2939653338,
                      "jobId": "SampleJob",
                      "lastUpdatedAt": 1567701875.743,
                      "queuedAt": 1567701902.444,
                      "versionNumber": 3
                }
              ]
          }

       Guide.

OUTPUT
       inProgressJobs -> (list)
          A list of JobExecutionSummary objects with status IN_PROGRESS.

          (structure)
              Contains a subset of information about a job execution.

              jobId -> (string)
                 The  unique  identifier  you assigned to this job when it was
                 created.

              queuedAt -> (long)
                 The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the job  exe-
                 cution was enqueued.

              startedAt -> (long)
                 The  time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the job exe-
                 cution started.

              lastUpdatedAt -> (long)
                 The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the job  exe-
                 cution was last updated.

              versionNumber -> (long)
                 The  version of the job execution. Job execution versions are
                 incremented each time AWS IoT Jobs receives an update from  a
                 device.

              executionNumber -> (long)
                 A number that identifies a particular job execution on a par-
                 ticular device.

       queuedJobs -> (list)
          A list of JobExecutionSummary objects with status QUEUED.

          (structure)
              Contains a subset of information about a job execution.

              jobId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier you assigned to this job  when  it  was
                 created.

              queuedAt -> (long)
                 The  time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the job exe-
                 cution was enqueued.

              startedAt -> (long)
                 The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the job  exe-
                 cution started.

              lastUpdatedAt -> (long)
                 The  time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the job exe-
                 cution was last updated.

              versionNumber -> (long)
                 The version of the job execution. Job execution versions  are
                 incremented  each time AWS IoT Jobs receives an update from a
                 device.

              executionNumber -> (long)
                 A number that identifies a particular job execution on a par-
