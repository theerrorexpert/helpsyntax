       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-job-execution
          --job-id <value>
          --thing-name <value>
          --status <value>
          [--status-details <value>]
          [--step-timeout-in-minutes <value>]
          [--expected-version <value>]
          [--include-job-execution-state | --no-include-job-execution-state]
          [--include-job-document | --no-include-job-document]
          [--execution-number <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The unique identifier assigned to this job when it was created.

       --thing-name (string)
          The name of the thing associated with the device.

       --status (string)
          The  new status for the job execution (IN_PROGRESS, FAILED, SUCCESS,
          or REJECTED). This must be specified on every update.

          Possible values:

          o QUEUED

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o SUCCEEDED

          o FAILED

          o TIMED_OUT

          o REJECTED

          o REMOVED

          o CANCELED

       --status-details (map)
          Optional. A collection of name/value pairs that describe the  status
          of  the  job  execution.  If  not  specified,  the statusDetails are
          unchanged.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --step-timeout-in-minutes (long)
          Specifies the amount of time this device has to finish execution  of
          this job. If the job execution status is not set to a terminal state
          before this timer expires, or before the timer is  reset  (by  again
          calling  UpdateJobExecution  , setting the status to IN_PROGRESS and
          specifying a new timeout value in this field) the job execution sta-
          tus  will  be  automatically set to TIMED_OUT . Note that setting or
          resetting this timeout has no effect on that job  execution  timeout
          which  may  have  been specified when the job was created (CreateJob
          using field timeoutConfig ).

       --expected-version (long)
          Optional. The expected current version of the  job  execution.  Each
          time  you  update  the job execution, its version is incremented. If
          the version of the job execution stored in Jobs does not match,  the
          update  is  rejected  with  a VersionMismatch error, and an ErrorRe-
          sponse that contains  the  current  job  execution  status  data  is
          returned.   (This   makes  it  unnecessary  to  perform  a  separate
          DescribeJobExecution request in order to obtain  the  job  execution
          status data.)

       --include-job-execution-state     |    --no-include-job-execution-state
       (boolean)
          Optional. When included and set to true, the response  contains  the
          JobExecutionState data. The default is false.

       --include-job-document | --no-include-job-document (boolean)
          Optional.  When set to true, the response contains the job document.
          The default is false.

       --execution-number (long)
          Optional. A number that identifies a particular job execution  on  a
          particular device.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update the status of a job execution

       The  following  update-job-execution  example updates the status of the
       specified job and thing.

          aws iot-jobs-data update-job-execution \
              --job-id SampleJob \
              --thing-name MotionSensor1 \
              --status REMOVED \
              --endpoint-url https://1234567890abcd.jobs.iot.us-west-2.amazonaws.com

       Output:

          {
              "executionState": {
                  "status": "REMOVED",
                  "versionNumber": 3
              },
          }

       For more information, see Devices and Jobs in  the  AWS  IoT  Developer
       Guide.

       executionState -> (structure)
          A JobExecutionState object.

          status -> (string)
              The  status  of  the  job  execution.  Can  be one of: "QUEUED",
              "IN_PROGRESS", "FAILED", "SUCCESS", "CANCELED",  "REJECTED",  or
              "REMOVED".

          statusDetails -> (map)
              A collection of name/value pairs that describe the status of the
              job execution.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          versionNumber -> (long)
              The version of the job execution.  Job  execution  versions  are
              incremented each time they are updated by a device.

       jobDocument -> (string)
          The contents of the Job Documents.
