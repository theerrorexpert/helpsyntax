NAME
       admin-disable-provider-for-user -

DESCRIPTION
       Disables  the user from signing in with the specified external (SAML or
       social) identity provider. If the user to disable  is  a  Cognito  User
       Pools  native  username  + password user, they are not permitted to use
       their password to sign-in. If the user to disable is a linked  external
       IdP  user,  any link between that user and an existing user is removed.
       The next time the external user (no longer attached to  the  previously
       linked DestinationUser ) signs in, they must create a new user account.
       See AdminLinkProviderForUser .

       This action is enabled only for admin  access  and  requires  developer
       credentials.

       The  ProviderName  must  match the value specified when creating an IdP
       for the pool.

       To disable a native username + password user,  the  ProviderName  value
       must be Cognito and the ProviderAttributeName must be Cognito_Subject ,
       with the ProviderAttributeValue being the name that is used in the user
       pool for the user.

       The  ProviderAttributeName  must  always  be Cognito_Subject for social
       identity providers. The ProviderAttributeValue must always be the exact
       subject  that  was used when the user was originally linked as a source
       user.

       For de-linking a SAML identity, there are two scenarios. If the  linked
       identity  has  not  yet been used to sign-in, the ProviderAttributeName
       and ProviderAttributeValue must be the same values that were  used  for
       the  SourceUser when the identities were originally linked using Admin-
       LinkProviderForUser call. (If the linking  was  done  with  ProviderAt-
       tributeName  set  to Cognito_Subject , the same applies here). However,
       if the user has already signed in, the  ProviderAttributeName  must  be
       Cognito_Subject  and  ProviderAttributeValue must be the subject of the
       SAML assertion.

SYNOPSIS
            admin-disable-provider-for-user
          --user-pool-id <value>
          --user <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID for the user pool.

       --user (structure)
          The user to be disabled.

          ProviderName -> (string)
              The name of the provider,  for  example,  Facebook,  Google,  or
              Login with Amazon.

          ProviderAttributeName -> (string)
              The  name  of  the  provider  attribute to link to, for example,
              NameID .

          ProviderAttributeValue -> (string)
              The value of the provider attribute to  link  to,  for  example,
              xxxxx_account .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ProviderName=string,ProviderAttributeName=string,ProviderAttributeValue=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ProviderName": "string",
            "ProviderAttributeName": "string",
            "ProviderAttributeValue": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
