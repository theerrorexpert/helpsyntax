FORGOT-PASSWORD()                                            FORGOT-PASSWORD()



NAME
       forgot-password -

DESCRIPTION
       Calling  this  API  causes  a message to be sent to the end user with a
       confirmation code that is required to change the user's  password.  For
       the  Username  parameter,  you  can use the username or user alias. The
       method used to send the confirmation code  is  sent  according  to  the
       specified  AccountRecoverySetting. For more information, see Recovering
       User Accounts in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide . If neither a ver-
       ified  phone number nor a verified email exists, an InvalidParameterEx-
       ception is thrown. To use the confirmation code for resetting the pass-
       word, call ConfirmForgotPassword .

       NOTE:
          This  action  might  generate  an SMS text message. Starting June 1,
          2021, U.S. telecom carriers require that you register an origination
          phone number before you can send SMS messages to U.S. phone numbers.
          If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register  a
          phone  number with Amazon Pinpoint . Cognito will use the the regis-
          tered number  automatically.  Otherwise,  Cognito  users  that  must
          receive  SMS  messages  might  be  unable to sign up, activate their
          accounts, or sign in.

          If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or  any
          other Amazon Web Service, Amazon SNS might place your account in SMS
          sandbox. In * sandbox mode * , youll have limitations, such as send-
          ing  messages  to  only verified phone numbers. After testing in the
          sandbox environment, you can move out of the SMS  sandbox  and  into
          production.  For more information, see SMS message settings for Cog-
          nito User Pools in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-id (string)
          The ID of the client associated with the user pool.

       --secret-hash (string)
          A keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC) calculated using the
          secret  key of a user pool client and username plus the client ID in
          the message.

       --user-context-data (structure)
          Contextual data such as the user's device fingerprint,  IP  address,
          or  location  used for evaluating the risk of an unexpected event by
          Amazon Cognito advanced security.

          EncodedData -> (string)
              Contextual data  such  as  the  user's  device  fingerprint,  IP
              address,  or  location  used for evaluating the risk of an unex-
              pected event by Amazon Cognito advanced security.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          EncodedData=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "EncodedData": "string"
          }

       --username (string)
          The user name of the user for whom you want to enter a code to reset
          a forgotten password.

       --analytics-metadata (structure)
          The  Amazon  Pinpoint  analytics metadata for collecting metrics for
          ForgotPassword calls.

          AnalyticsEndpointId -> (string)
              The endpoint ID.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AnalyticsEndpointId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AnalyticsEndpointId": "string"
          }

       --client-metadata (map)
          A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide  as  input  for
          any custom workflows that this action triggers.

          You  create  custom  workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user
          pool triggers. When you use the ForgotPassword  API  action,  Amazon
          Cognito  invokes  any  functions  that are assigned to the following
          triggers: pre sign-up , custom message , and user migration  .  When
          Amazon Cognito invokes any of these functions, it passes a JSON pay-
          load, which the function receives as input. This payload contains  a
          clientMetadata  attribute, which provides the data that you assigned
          to the ClientMetadata parameter in your ForgotPassword  request.  In
          your  function  code  in  Lambda, you can process the clientMetadata
          value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.

          For more information,  see  Customizing  User  Pool  Workflows  with
          Lambda Triggers in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              Take  the  following limitations into consideration when you use
              the ClientMetadata parameter:

              o Amazon Cognito does not store the ClientMetadata  value.  This
                data is available only to Lambda triggers that are assigned to
                a user pool to support custom workflows.  If  your  user  pool
                configuration  does  not  include triggers, the ClientMetadata
                parameter serves no purpose.

              o Amazon Cognito does not validate the ClientMetadata value.

              o Amazon Cognito does not encrypt the the ClientMetadata  value,
                so don't use it to provide sensitive information.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
