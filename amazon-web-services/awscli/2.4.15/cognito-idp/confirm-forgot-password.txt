OPTIONS
       --client-id (string)
          The app client ID of the app associated with the user pool.

       --secret-hash (string)
          A keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC) calculated using the
          secret  key of a user pool client and username plus the client ID in
          the message.

       --username (string)
          The user name of the user for whom you  want  to  enter  a  code  to
          retrieve a forgotten password.

       --confirmation-code (string)
          The confirmation code sent by a user's request to retrieve a forgot-
          ten password. For more information, see ForgotPassword .

       --password (string)
          The password sent by a user's request to retrieve a forgotten  pass-
          word.

       --analytics-metadata (structure)
          The  Amazon  Pinpoint  analytics metadata for collecting metrics for
          ConfirmForgotPassword calls.

          AnalyticsEndpointId -> (string)
              The endpoint ID.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AnalyticsEndpointId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AnalyticsEndpointId": "string"
          }

       --user-context-data (structure)
          Contextual data such as the user's device fingerprint,  IP  address,
          or  location  used for evaluating the risk of an unexpected event by
          Amazon Cognito advanced security.

          EncodedData -> (string)
              Contextual data  such  as  the  user's  device  fingerprint,  IP
              address,  or  location  used for evaluating the risk of an unex-
              pected event by Amazon Cognito advanced security.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          EncodedData=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "EncodedData": "string"
          }

       --client-metadata (map)
          A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide  as  input  for
          any custom workflows that this action triggers.

          You  create  custom  workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user
          pool triggers. When you use the  ConfirmForgotPassword  API  action,
          Amazon  Cognito  invokes  the  function that is assigned to the post
          confirmation trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function,  it
          passes  a  JSON  payload, which the function receives as input. This
          payload contains a clientMetadata attribute, which provides the data
          that  you  assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your Confirm-
          ForgotPassword request. In your function code  in  Lambda,  you  can
          process  the  clientMetadata value to enhance your workflow for your
          specific needs.

          For more information,  see  Customizing  User  Pool  Workflows  with
          Lambda Triggers in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              Take  the  following limitations into consideration when you use
              the ClientMetadata parameter:

              o Amazon Cognito does not store the ClientMetadata  value.  This
                data is available only to Lambda triggers that are assigned to
                a user pool to support custom workflows.  If  your  user  pool
                configuration  does  not  include triggers, the ClientMetadata
                parameter serves no purpose.

              o Amazon Cognito does not validate the ClientMetadata value.

              o Amazon Cognito does not encrypt the the ClientMetadata  value,
                so don't use it to provide sensitive information.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.
