LIST-USERS()                                                      LIST-USERS()



NAME
       list-users -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the users in the Amazon Cognito user pool.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-users  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: Users

SYNOPSIS
            list-users
          --user-pool-id <value>
          [--attributes-to-get <value>]
          [--filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID for the user pool on which  the  search  should  be
          performed.

       --attributes-to-get (list)
          An  array  of  strings,  where  each  string  is  the name of a user
          attribute to be returned for each user in the search results. If the
          array is null, all attributes are returned.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filter (string)
          A  filter string of the form "AttributeName  Filter-Type "Attribute-
          Value "". Quotation marks within the filter string must  be  escaped
          using  the  backslash  ()  character.  For  example,  "family_name =
          "Reddy"".

          o AttributeName : The name of the attribute to search for.  You  can
            only search for one attribute at a time.

          o Filter-Type  : For an exact match, use =, for example, "given_name
            = "Jon"". For a prefix ("starts with") match, use ^=, for example,
            "given_name ^= "Jon"".

          o AttributeValue : The attribute value that must be matched for each
            user.

          If the filter string is empty, ListUsers returns all  users  in  the
          user pool.

          You can only search for the following standard attributes:

          o username (case-sensitive)

          o email

          o phone_number

          o name

          o given_name

          o family_name

          o preferred_username

          o cognito:user_status  (called Status in the Console) (case-insensi-
            tive)

          o status (called **Enabled** in the Console) (case-sensitive)

          o sub

          Custom attributes are not searchable.

          For more information, see Searching for Users  Using  the  ListUsers
          API  and  Examples  of Using the ListUsers API in the Amazon Cognito
          Developer Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
