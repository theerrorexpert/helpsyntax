ADMIN-LINK-PROVIDER-FOR-USER()                  ADMIN-LINK-PROVIDER-FOR-USER()



NAME
       admin-link-provider-for-user -

DESCRIPTION
       Links  an existing user account in a user pool (DestinationUser ) to an
       identity from an external identity provider (SourceUser )  based  on  a
       specified attribute name and value from the external identity provider.
       This allows you to create a link from the existing user account  to  an
       external federated user identity that has not yet been used to sign in,
       so that the federated user identity can be  used  to  sign  in  as  the
       existing user account.

       For example, if there is an existing user with a username and password,
       this API links that user to a federated user identity, so that when the
       federated user identity is used, the user signs in as the existing user
       account.

       NOTE:
          The maximum number of federated identities linked to a user is 5.

       WARNING:
          Because this API allows a user with an external  federated  identity
          to sign in as an existing user in the user pool, it is critical that
          it only be  used  with  external  identity  providers  and  provider
          attributes that have been trusted by the application owner.

       This  action  is  enabled  only for admin access and requires developer
       credentials.

SYNOPSIS
            admin-link-provider-for-user
          --user-pool-id <value>
          --destination-user <value>
          --source-user <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID for the user pool.

       --destination-user (structure)
          The existing user in the user pool to  be  linked  to  the  external
          identity  provider  user  account. Can be a native (Username + Pass-
          word) Cognito User Pools user or a federated user  (for  example,  a
          SAML  or  Facebook user). If the user doesn't exist, an exception is
          thrown. This is the user that is returned when the  new  user  (with
          the linked identity provider attribute) signs in.

          For  a  native  username + password user, the ProviderAttributeValue
          for the DestinationUser should be the username in the user pool. For
          a federated user, it should be the provider-specific user_id .

          The ProviderAttributeName of the DestinationUser is ignored.

          The  ProviderName should be set to Cognito for users in Cognito user
          pools.

          ProviderName -> (string)
              The name of the provider,  for  example,  Facebook,  Google,  or
              Login with Amazon.

          ProviderAttributeName -> (string)
              The  name  of  the  provider  attribute to link to, for example,
              NameID .

          ProviderAttributeValue -> (string)
              The value of the provider attribute to  link  to,  for  example,
              xxxxx_account .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ProviderName=string,ProviderAttributeName=string,ProviderAttributeValue=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ProviderName": "string",
            "ProviderAttributeName": "string",
            "ProviderAttributeValue": "string"
          }

       --source-user (structure)
          An  external  identity provider account for a user who does not cur-
          rently exist yet in the user pool. This user  must  be  a  federated
          user  (for  example,  a  SAML  or Facebook user), not another native
          user.

          If the SourceUser is  a  federated  social  identity  provider  user
          (Facebook, Google, or Login with Amazon), you must set the Provider-
          AttributeName to Cognito_Subject . For  social  identity  providers,
          the  ProviderName  will  be Facebook , Google , or LoginWithAmazon ,
          and Cognito will automatically parse the Facebook, Google, and Login
          with  Amazon  tokens  for id , sub , and user_id , respectively. The
          ProviderAttributeValue for the user must be the same value as the id
          ,  sub  ,  or  user_id  value  found in the social identity provider
          token.

          For SAML, the ProviderAttributeName can be any value that matches  a
          claim in the SAML assertion. If you wish to link SAML users based on
          the subject of the SAML assertion, you should map the subject  to  a
          claim  through the SAML identity provider and submit that claim name
          as the ProviderAttributeName . If you set  ProviderAttributeName  to
          Cognito_Subject  ,  Cognito  will  automatically  parse  the default
          unique identifier found in the subject from the SAML token.

          ProviderName -> (string)
              The name of the provider,  for  example,  Facebook,  Google,  or
              Login with Amazon.

          ProviderAttributeName -> (string)
              The  name  of  the  provider  attribute to link to, for example,
              NameID .

          ProviderAttributeValue -> (string)
              The value of the provider attribute to  link  to,  for  example,
              xxxxx_account .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ProviderName=string,ProviderAttributeName=string,ProviderAttributeValue=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ProviderName": "string",
            "ProviderAttributeName": "string",
            "ProviderAttributeValue": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       None
