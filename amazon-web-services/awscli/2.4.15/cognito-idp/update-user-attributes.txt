UPDATE-USER-ATTRIBUTES()                              UPDATE-USER-ATTRIBUTES()



NAME
       update-user-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Allows a user to update a specific attribute (one at a time).

       NOTE:
          This  action  might  generate  an SMS text message. Starting June 1,
          2021, U.S. telecom carriers require that you register an origination
          phone number before you can send SMS messages to U.S. phone numbers.
          If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register  a
          phone  number with Amazon Pinpoint . Cognito will use the the regis-
          tered number  automatically.  Otherwise,  Cognito  users  that  must
          receive  SMS  messages  might  be  unable to sign up, activate their
          accounts, or sign in.

          If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or  any
          other Amazon Web Service, Amazon SNS might place your account in SMS
          sandbox. In * sandbox mode * , youll have limitations, such as send-
          ing  messages  to  only verified phone numbers. After testing in the
          sandbox environment, you can move out of the SMS  sandbox  and  into
          production.  For more information, see SMS message settings for Cog-
          nito User Pools in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            update-user-attributes
          --user-attributes <value>
          --access-token <value>
          [--client-metadata <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-attributes (list)
          An array of name-value pairs representing user attributes.

          For custom attributes, you must prepend the custom:  prefix  to  the
          attribute name.

          (structure)
              Specifies whether the attribute is standard or custom.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the attribute.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the attribute.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --access-token (string)
          The access token for the request to update user attributes.

       --client-metadata (map)
          A  map  of  custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for
          any custom workflows that this action triggers.

          You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda  functions  to  user
          pool  triggers.  When  you  use the UpdateUserAttributes API action,
          Amazon Cognito invokes the function that is assigned to  the  custom
          message  trigger.  When  Amazon  Cognito  invokes  this function, it
          passes a JSON payload, which the function receives  as  input.  This
          payload contains a clientMetadata attribute, which provides the data
          that you assigned to the  ClientMetadata  parameter  in  your  Upda-
          teUserAttributes  request.  In your function code in Lambda, you can
          process the clientMetadata value to enhance your workflow  for  your
          specific needs.

          For  more  information,  see  Customizing  User  Pool Workflows with
          Lambda Triggers in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              Take the following limitations into consideration when  you  use
              the ClientMetadata parameter:

              o Amazon  Cognito  does not store the ClientMetadata value. This
                data is available only to Lambda triggers that are assigned to
                a  user  pool  to  support custom workflows. If your user pool
                configuration does not include  triggers,  the  ClientMetadata
                parameter serves no purpose.

              o Amazon Cognito does not validate the ClientMetadata value.

              o Amazon  Cognito does not encrypt the the ClientMetadata value,
                so don't use it to provide sensitive information.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
