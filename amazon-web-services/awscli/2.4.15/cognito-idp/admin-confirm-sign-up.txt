NAME
       admin-confirm-sign-up -

DESCRIPTION
       Confirms  user  registration  as  an admin without using a confirmation
       code. Works on any user.

       Calling this action requires developer credentials.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            admin-confirm-sign-up
          --user-pool-id <value>
          --username <value>
          [--client-metadata <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID for which you want to confirm user registration.

       --username (string)
          The user name for which you want to confirm user registration.

       --client-metadata (map)
          A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide  as  input  for
          any custom workflows that this action triggers.

          If your user pool configuration includes triggers, the AdminConfirm-
          SignUp API action invokes the Lambda function that is specified  for
          the  post  confirmation  trigger.  When  Amazon Cognito invokes this
          function, it passes a JSON payload, which the function  receives  as
          input.  In  this  payload, the clientMetadata attribute provides the
          data that you assigned  to  the  ClientMetadata  parameter  in  your
          AdminConfirmSignUp request. In your function code in Lambda, you can
          process the ClientMetadata value to enhance your workflow  for  your
          specific needs.

          For  more  information,  see  Customizing  User  Pool Workflows with
          Lambda Triggers in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              Take the following limitations into consideration when  you  use
              the ClientMetadata parameter:

              o Amazon  Cognito  does not store the ClientMetadata value. This
                data is available only to Lambda triggers that are assigned to
                a  user  pool  to  support custom workflows. If your user pool
                configuration does not include  triggers,  the  ClientMetadata
                parameter serves no purpose.

              o Amazon Cognito does not validate the ClientMetadata value.

              o Amazon  Cognito does not encrypt the the ClientMetadata value,
                so don't use it to provide sensitive information.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
