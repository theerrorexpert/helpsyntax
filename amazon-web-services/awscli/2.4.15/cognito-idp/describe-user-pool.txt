NAME
       describe-user-pool -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  configuration  information  and metadata of the specified
       user pool.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-user-pool
          --user-pool-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID for the user pool you want to describe.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     NOTE:
                        We  recommend that you use WriteAttributes in the user
                        pool client to control how attributes can  be  mutated
                        for  new  use  cases instead of using DeveloperOnlyAt-
                        tribute .

                     Specifies whether the attribute type is  developer  only.
                     This  attribute can only be modified by an administrator.
                     Users will not be able to  modify  this  attribute  using
                     their  access  token. For example, DeveloperOnlyAttribute
                     can be modified using AdminUpdateUserAttributes but  can-
                     not be updated using UpdateUserAttributes.

                 Mutable -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether  the  value  of  the  attribute can be
                     changed.

                     For any user pool attribute that's mapped to an  identity
                     provider attribute, you must set this parameter to true .
                     Amazon Cognito updates mapped attributes when users  sign
                     in  to  your application through an identity provider. If
                     an attribute is immutable, Amazon Cognito throws an error
                     when it attempts to update the attribute. For more infor-
                     mation, see Specifying Identity Provider  Attribute  Map-
                     pings for Your User Pool .

                 Required -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether  a user pool attribute is required. If
                     the attribute is required and the user does not provide a
                     value, registration or sign-in will fail.

                 NumberAttributeConstraints -> (structure)
                     Specifies  the constraints for an attribute of the number
                     type.

                        The  maximum value of an attribute that is of the num-
                        ber data type.

                 StringAttributeConstraints -> (structure)
                     Specifies the constraints for an attribute of the  string
                     type.

                 ing ways, depending on the value that  you  specify  for  the
                 EmailSendingAccount parameter:

                 o If  you  specify COGNITO_DEFAULT , Amazon Cognito uses this
                   address as the custom FROM  address  when  it  emails  your
                   users by using its built-in email account.

                 o If you specify DEVELOPER , Amazon Cognito emails your users
                   with this address by calling Amazon SES on your behalf.

              ReplyToEmailAddress -> (string)
                 The destination to which the receiver  of  the  email  should
                 reply to.

              EmailSendingAccount -> (string)
                 Specifies  whether  Amazon Cognito emails your users by using
                 its built-in email functionality or  your  Amazon  SES  email
                 configuration. Specify one of the following values:
                     COGNITO_DEFAULT

                 When  Amazon  Cognito emails your users, it uses its built-in
                 email functionality. When you use the default option,  Amazon
                 Cognito  allows  only a limited number of emails each day for
                 your user pool.  For  typical  production  environments,  the
                 default email limit is below the required delivery volume. To
                 achieve a higher delivery volume, specify  DEVELOPER  to  use
                 your Amazon SES email configuration.

                 To  look  up the email delivery limit for the default option,
                 see Limits in Amazon Cognito in the Amazon Cognito  Developer
                 Guide .

                 The  default  FROM address is no-reply@verificationemail.com.
                 To customize the FROM address, provide the ARN of  an  Amazon
                 SES verified email address for the SourceArn parameter.

                 If  EmailSendingAccount  is  COGNITO_DEFAULT,  the  following
                 parameters aren't allowed:

                 o EmailVerificationMessage

                 o EmailVerificationSubject

                 o InviteMessageTemplate.EmailMessage

                 o InviteMessageTemplate.EmailSubject

                 o VerificationMessageTemplate.EmailMessage

                 o VerificationMessageTemplate.EmailMessageByLink

                 o VerificationMessageTemplate.EmailSubject,

                 o VerificationMessageTemplate.EmailSubjectByLink

                 NOTE:
                     DEVELOPER EmailSendingAccount is required.

                     DEVELOPER

                 When Amazon Cognito emails your users, it  uses  your  Amazon
                 SES  configuration.  Amazon  Cognito calls Amazon SES on your
                 behalf to send email from your verified email  address.  When
                 you  use  this option, the email delivery limits are the same
                 limits that apply to your Amazon SES verified  email  address
                 in your account.

                 If you use this option, you must provide the ARN of an Amazon
                 SES verified email address for the SourceArn parameter.

                 Before Amazon Cognito can email your users, it requires addi-
                 tional  permissions  to  call Amazon SES on your behalf. When
                 you update your user pool with this  option,  Amazon  Cognito
                 creates  a service-linked role , which is a type of IAM role,
                 in your account. This  role  contains  the  permissions  that
                 allow Amazon Cognito to access Amazon SES and send email mes-
                 sages with your address. For more information about the  ser-
                 vice-linked  role that Amazon Cognito creates, see Using Ser-
                 vice-Linked Roles for Amazon Cognito in  the  Amazon  Cognito
                 Developer Guide .

              From -> (string)
                 Identifies  either  the  senders email address or the senders
                 name with their email address.  For  example,  testuser@exam-
                 ple.com  or  Test  User <testuser@example.com> . This address
                 will appear before the body of the email.

              ConfigurationSet -> (string)
                 The set of configuration rules that can be applied to  emails
                 sent  using  Amazon SES. A configuration set is applied to an
                 email by including a reference to the  configuration  set  in
                 the  headers  of the email. Once applied, all of the rules in
                 that configuration set are applied to the  email.  Configura-
                 tion  sets  can be used to apply the following types of rules
                 to emails:

                 o Event publishing  Amazon SES can track the number of  send,
                   delivery,  open,  click,  bounce,  and complaint events for
                   each email sent. Use event publishing to  send  information
                   about  these  events  to other Amazon Web Services services
                   such as SNS and CloudWatch.

                 o IP pool management  When  leasing  dedicated  IP  addresses
                   with  Amazon  SES,  you  can create groups of IP addresses,
                   called dedicated IP pools. You can then associate the dedi-
                   cated IP pools with configuration sets.

          SmsConfiguration -> (structure)
              The SMS configuration.

              SnsCallerArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Simple Notifica-
                 tion Service (SNS) caller. This is the ARN of the IAM role in
                 your account which Cognito will use to send SMS messages. SMS
                 messages are subject to a spending limit .

              ExternalId -> (string)
                 The external ID is a value that we recommend you use  to  add
                 security to your IAM role which is used to call Amazon SNS to
                 send SMS messages for your  user  pool.  If  you  provide  an
                 ExternalId  ,  the  Cognito  User  Pool  will include it when
                 attempting to assume your IAM role, so that you can set  your
                 roles trust policy to require the ExternalID . If you use the
                 Cognito Management Console to create a role for SMS MFA, Cog-
                 nito  will  create a role with the required permissions and a
                 trust policy that demonstrates use of the ExternalId .

                 For more information about the ExternalId of a role, see  How
                 to use an external ID when granting access to your Amazon Web
                 Services resources to a third party

          UserPoolTags -> (map)
              The tags that are assigned to the user pool. A tag  is  a  label
              that  you  can apply to user pools to categorize and manage them
              in different ways, such as by purpose,  owner,  environment,  or
              other criteria.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          SmsConfigurationFailure -> (string)
              The reason why the SMS configuration cannot send the messages to
              your users.

              This message might include comma-separated  values  to  describe
              why  your SMS configuration can't send messages to user pool end
              users.

              o InvalidSmsRoleAccessPolicyException - The IAM role which  Cog-
                nito uses to send SMS messages is not properly configured. For
                more information, see SmsConfigurationType .

              o SNSSandbox - The account is in SNS Sandbox and  messages  wont
                reach  unverified end users. This parameter wont get populated
                with SNSSandbox if the IAM user creating the user pool  doesnt
                have SNS permissions. To learn how to move your account out of
                the sandbox, see Moving out of the SMS sandbox .

          EmailConfigurationFailure -> (string)
              The reason why the email configuration cannot send the  messages
              to your users.

          Domain -> (string)
              Holds the domain prefix if the user pool has a domain associated
              with it.

          CustomDomain -> (string)
              A custom domain name that you provide to  Amazon  Cognito.  This
              parameter  applies  only  if you use a custom domain to host the
              sign-up and sign-in pages for  your  application.  For  example:
              auth.example.com .

              For  more  information about adding a custom domain to your user
              pool, see Using Your Own Domain for the Hosted UI .

          AdminCreateUserConfig -> (structure)
              The configuration for AdminCreateUser requests.

              AllowAdminCreateUserOnly -> (boolean)
                 Set to True if only the administrator is  allowed  to  create
                 user  profiles.  Set to False if users can sign themselves up
                 via an app.

              UnusedAccountValidityDays -> (integer)
                 The user account expiration limit, in days, after  which  the
                 account  is no longer usable. To reset the account after that
                 time limit, you must call AdminCreateUser  again,  specifying
                 "RESEND"  for  the MessageAction parameter. The default value
                 for this parameter is 7.

                 NOTE:
                     If you set a value for  TemporaryPasswordValidityDays  in
                     PasswordPolicy  ,  that  value will be used and UnusedAc-
                     countValidityDays will be deprecated for that user  pool.

              InviteMessageTemplate -> (structure)
                 The  message  template  to be used for the welcome message to
                 new users.

                 See also Customizing User Invitation Messages .

                 SMSMessage -> (string)

                 EmailMessage -> (string)
                     The message template for email messages. EmailMessage  is
                     allowed only if EmailSendingAccount is DEVELOPER.

                 EmailSubject -> (string)
                     The  subject  line  for  email  messages. EmailSubject is
                     allowed only if EmailSendingAccount is DEVELOPER.

          UserPoolAddOns -> (structure)
              The user pool add-ons.

              AdvancedSecurityMode -> (string)
                 The advanced security mode.

          UsernameConfiguration -> (structure)
              You can choose to enable case sensitivity on the username  input
              for  the  selected sign-in option. For example, when this is set
              to False , users will be able to sign in using either "username"
              or  "Username". This configuration is immutable once it has been
              set. For more information, see UsernameConfigurationType .

              CaseSensitive -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether username case sensitivity will  be  applied
                 for all users in the user pool through Cognito APIs.

                 Valid values include:

                 o
                   **
                   True  ** : Enables case sensitivity for all username input.
                   When this option is set to True , users must sign in  using
                   the exact capitalization of their given username. For exam-
                   ple, UserName. This is the default value.

                 o
                   **
                   False ** : Enables  case  insensitivity  for  all  username
                   input.  For  example,  when  this  option is set to False ,
                   users will be able to sign in using  either  "username"  or
                   "Username".  This  option also enables both preferred_user-
                   name and email alias to be case insensitive, in addition to
                   the username attribute.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the user pool.

          AccountRecoverySetting -> (structure)
              Use  this  setting  to  define which verified available method a
              user can use to recover their password when  they  call  Forgot-
              Password  .  It  allows  you to define a preferred method when a
              user has more than one method available. With this setting,  SMS
              does  not qualify for a valid password recovery mechanism if the
              user also has SMS MFA enabled. In the absence of  this  setting,
              Cognito  uses  the  legacy  behavior  to  determine the recovery
              method where SMS is preferred over email.

              RecoveryMechanisms -> (list)
                 The list of RecoveryOptionTypes .

                 (structure)
                     A map containing a priority as a key, and recovery method
                     name as a value.

                     Priority -> (integer)
                        A  positive  integer  specifying  priority of a method
                        with 1 being the highest priority.

                     Name -> (string)
                        Specifies the recovery method for a user.
