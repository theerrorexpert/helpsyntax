ASSOCIATE-SOFTWARE-TOKEN()                          ASSOCIATE-SOFTWARE-TOKEN()



NAME
       associate-software-token -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a unique generated shared secret key code for the user account.
       The request takes an access token or a session string, but not both.

       NOTE:
          Calling AssociateSoftwareToken immediately disassociates the  exist-
          ing software token from the user account. If the user doesn't subse-
          quently verify the software token, their account is essentially  set
          up  to authenticate without MFA. If MFA config is set to Optional at
          the user pool level, the user can then login without  MFA.  However,
          if  MFA is set to Required for the user pool, the user will be asked
          to setup a new software token MFA during sign in.

SYNOPSIS
            associate-software-token
          [--access-token <value>]
          [--session <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --access-token (string)
          The access token.

       --session (string)
          The session which should be passed both ways  in  challenge-response
          calls to the service. This allows authentication of the user as part
          of the MFA setup process.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SecretCode -> (string)
          A unique generated shared secret code that is used in the TOTP algo-
          rithm to generate a one time code.

       Session -> (string)
          The  session  which should be passed both ways in challenge-response
          calls to the service. This allows authentication of the user as part
          of the MFA setup process.
