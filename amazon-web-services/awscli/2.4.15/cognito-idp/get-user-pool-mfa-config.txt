GET-USER-POOL-MFA-CONFIG()                          GET-USER-POOL-MFA-CONFIG()



NAME
       get-user-pool-mfa-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the user pool multi-factor authentication (MFA) configuration.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-user-pool-mfa-config
          --user-pool-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SmsMfaConfiguration -> (structure)
          The SMS text message multi-factor (MFA) configuration.

          SmsAuthenticationMessage -> (string)
              The  SMS  authentication message that will be sent to users with
              the code they need to sign in.  The  message  must  contain  the
              {####} placeholder, which will be replaced with the code. If the
              message is not included, and default message will be used.

          SmsConfiguration -> (structure)
              The SMS configuration.

              SnsCallerArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Simple Notifica-
                 tion Service (SNS) caller. This is the ARN of the IAM role in
                 your account which Cognito will use to send SMS messages. SMS
                 messages are subject to a spending limit .

              ExternalId -> (string)
                 The  external  ID is a value that we recommend you use to add
                 security to your IAM role which is used to call Amazon SNS to
                 send  SMS  messages  for  your  user  pool. If you provide an
                 ExternalId , the Cognito  User  Pool  will  include  it  when
                 attempting  to assume your IAM role, so that you can set your
                 roles trust policy to require the ExternalID . If you use the
                 Cognito Management Console to create a role for SMS MFA, Cog-
                 nito will create a role with the required permissions  and  a
                 trust policy that demonstrates use of the ExternalId .

                 For  more information about the ExternalId of a role, see How
                 to use an external ID when granting access to your Amazon Web
                 Services resources to a third party

       SoftwareTokenMfaConfiguration -> (structure)
          The software token multi-factor (MFA) configuration.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether software token MFA is enabled.

       MfaConfiguration -> (string)
          The multi-factor (MFA) configuration. Valid values include:

          o OFF MFA will not be used for any users.

          o ON MFA is required for all users to sign in.

          o OPTIONAL  MFA  will be required only for individual users who have
            an MFA factor enabled.
