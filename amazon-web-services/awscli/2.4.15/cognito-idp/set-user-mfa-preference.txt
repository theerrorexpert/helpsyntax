SET-USER-MFA-PREFERENCE()                            SET-USER-MFA-PREFERENCE()



NAME
       set-user-mfa-preference -

DESCRIPTION
       Set  the  user's  multi-factor  authentication (MFA) method preference,
       including which MFA factors are enabled and if any are preferred.  Only
       one  factor  can  be set as preferred. The preferred MFA factor will be
       used to authenticate a user if multiple factors are enabled. If  multi-
       ple options are enabled and no preference is set, a challenge to choose
       an MFA option will be returned during  sign  in.  If  an  MFA  type  is
       enabled  for  a user, the user will be prompted for MFA during all sign
       in attempts, unless device tracking is turned on  and  the  device  has
       been  trusted. If you would like MFA to be applied selectively based on
       the assessed risk level of sign in attempts, disable MFA for users  and
       turn on Adaptive Authentication for the user pool.

SYNOPSIS
            set-user-mfa-preference
          [--sms-mfa-settings <value>]
          [--software-token-mfa-settings <value>]
          --access-token <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --sms-mfa-settings (structure)
          The SMS text message multi-factor authentication (MFA) settings.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  SMS  text  message MFA is enabled. If an MFA
              type is enabled for a user, the user will be  prompted  for  MFA
              during all sign in attempts, unless device tracking is turned on
              and the device has been trusted.

          PreferredMfa -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether SMS is the preferred MFA method.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Enabled=boolean,PreferredMfa=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Enabled": true|false,
            "PreferredMfa": true|false
          }

       --software-token-mfa-settings (structure)
          The time-based one-time password software token MFA settings.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether software token MFA is enabled. If an MFA  type
              is  enabled for a user, the user will be prompted for MFA during
              all sign in attempts, unless device tracking is  turned  on  and
              the device has been trusted.

          PreferredMfa -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  software  token  MFA  is  the  preferred MFA
              method.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Enabled=boolean,PreferredMfa=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Enabled": true|false,
            "PreferredMfa": true|false
          }

       --access-token (string)
          The access token for the user.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To set user MFA settings

       This example modifies the MFA delivery  options.  It  changes  the  MFA
       delivery medium to SMS.

       Command:

          aws cognito-idp set-user-mfa-preference --access-token ACCESS_TOKEN --mfa-options DeliveryMedium="SMS",AttributeName="phone_number"

OUTPUT
       None
