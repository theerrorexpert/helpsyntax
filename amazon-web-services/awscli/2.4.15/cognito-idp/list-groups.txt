LIST-GROUPS()                                                    LIST-GROUPS()



NAME
       list-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the groups associated with a user pool.

       Calling this action requires developer credentials.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-groups  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: Groups

SYNOPSIS
            list-groups
          --user-pool-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID for the user pool.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Groups -> (list)
          The group objects for the groups.

          (structure)
              The group type.

              GroupName -> (string)
                 The name of the group.

              UserPoolId -> (string)
                 The user pool ID for the user pool.

              Description -> (string)
                 A string containing the description of the group.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The role ARN for the group.

              Precedence -> (integer)
                 A  nonnegative integer value that specifies the precedence of
                 this group relative to the  other  groups  that  a  user  can
                 belong  to in the user pool. If a user belongs to two or more
                 groups, it is the group with  the  highest  precedence  whose
                 role  ARN  will be used in the cognito:roles and cognito:pre-
                 ferred_role claims in the user's tokens. Groups  with  higher
                 Precedence  values  take  precedence  over  groups with lower
                 Precedence values or with null Precedence values.

                 Two groups can have the same Precedence value. If  this  hap-
                 pens,  neither  group takes precedence over the other. If two
                 groups with the same Precedence have the same role ARN,  that
                 role  is  used  in the cognito:preferred_role claim in tokens
                 for users in each group. If the  two  groups  have  different
                 role  ARNs,  the  cognito:preferred_role  claim is not set in
                 users' tokens.

                 The default Precedence value is null.

              LastModifiedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date the group was last modified.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date the group was created.

       NextToken -> (string)
          An identifier that was returned from the previous call to this oper-
          ation,  which  can  be  used  to return the next set of items in the
          list.
