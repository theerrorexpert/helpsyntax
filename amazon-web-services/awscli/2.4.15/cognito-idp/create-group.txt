DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new group in the specified user pool.

       Calling this action requires developer credentials.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-group
          --group-name <value>
          --user-pool-id <value>
          [--description <value>]
          [--role-arn <value>]
          [--precedence <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --group-name (string)
          The name of the group. Must be unique.

       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID for the user pool.

       --description (string)
          A string containing the description of the group.

       --role-arn (string)
          The role ARN for the group.

       --precedence (integer)
          A  nonnegative  integer  value that specifies the precedence of this
          group relative to the other groups that a user can belong to in  the
          user  pool.  Zero is the highest precedence value. Groups with lower
          Precedence values take precedence over groups with  higher  or  null
          Precedence  values.  If  a user belongs to two or more groups, it is
          the group with the lowest precedence value whose role  ARN  will  be
          used  in  the cognito:roles and cognito:preferred_role claims in the
          user's tokens.

          Two groups can have the same Precedence value. If this happens, nei-
          ther  group  takes precedence over the other. If two groups with the
          same Precedence have the same role ARN, that role  is  used  in  the
          cognito:preferred_role  claim  in tokens for users in each group. If
          the two groups have different role ARNs, the  cognito:preferred_role
          claim is not set in users' tokens.

          The default Precedence value is null.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a group

       This example creates a group with a description.

       Command:

          aws cognito-idp create-group --user-pool-id us-west-2_aaaaaaaaa --group-name MyNewGroup --description "New group."

       Output:

          {
            "Group": {
                "GroupName": "MyNewGroup",
                "UserPoolId": "us-west-2_aaaaaaaaa",
                "Description": "New group.",
                "LastModifiedDate": 1548270073.795,
                "CreationDate": 1548270073.795
            }
          }

       To create a group with a role and precedence

       This  example  creates  a  group with a description. It also includes a
       role and precedence.

       Command:

          aws cognito-idp create-group --user-pool-id us-west-2_aaaaaaaaa --group-name MyNewGroupWithRole --description "New group with a role." --role-arn arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/MyNewGroupRole --precedence 2

       Output:

          {
            "Group": {
                "GroupName": "MyNewGroupWithRole",
                "UserPoolId": "us-west-2_aaaaaaaaa",
                "Description": "New group with a role.",
                "RoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/MyNewGroupRole",
                "Precedence": 2,
                "LastModifiedDate": 1548270211.761,
                "CreationDate": 1548270211.761
            }
          }

OUTPUT
       Group -> (structure)
          The group object for the group.

          GroupName -> (string)
              The name of the group.

          UserPoolId -> (string)
              The user pool ID for the user pool.

          Description -> (string)
              A string containing the description of the group.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The role ARN for the group.

          Precedence -> (integer)
              A nonnegative integer value that  specifies  the  precedence  of
              this  group  relative to the other groups that a user can belong
              to in the user pool. If a user belongs to two or more groups, it
              is  the group with the highest precedence whose role ARN will be
              used in the cognito:roles and cognito:preferred_role  claims  in
              the  user's  tokens.  Groups  with higher Precedence values take
              precedence over groups with lower Precedence values or with null
              Precedence values.

              Two  groups can have the same Precedence value. If this happens,
              neither group takes precedence over the  other.  If  two  groups
              with  the  same  Precedence have the same role ARN, that role is
              used in the cognito:preferred_role claim in tokens for users  in
              each group. If the two groups have different role ARNs, the cog-
              nito:preferred_role claim is not set in users' tokens.

              The default Precedence value is null.

          LastModifiedDate -> (timestamp)
              The date the group was last modified.

          CreationDate -> (timestamp)
              The date the group was created.
