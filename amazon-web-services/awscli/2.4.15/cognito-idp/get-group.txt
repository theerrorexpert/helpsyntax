GET-GROUP()                                                        GET-GROUP()



NAME
       get-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a group.

       Calling this action requires developer credentials.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-group
          --group-name <value>
          --user-pool-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --group-name (string)
          The name of the group.

       --user-pool-id (string)
          The user pool ID for the user pool.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about a group

       This example gets information about a group named MyGroup.

       Command:

          aws cognito-idp get-group --user-pool-id us-west-2_aaaaaaaaa --group-name MyGroup

       Output:

          {
            "Group": {
                "GroupName": "MyGroup",
                "UserPoolId": "us-west-2_aaaaaaaaa",
                "Description": "A sample group.",
                "LastModifiedDate": 1548270073.795,
                "CreationDate": 1548270073.795
            }
          }

OUTPUT
       Group -> (structure)
          The group object for the group.

          GroupName -> (string)
              The name of the group.

          UserPoolId -> (string)
              The user pool ID for the user pool.

          Description -> (string)
              A string containing the description of the group.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The role ARN for the group.

          Precedence -> (integer)
              A  nonnegative  integer  value  that specifies the precedence of
              this group relative to the other groups that a user  can  belong
              to in the user pool. If a user belongs to two or more groups, it
              is the group with the highest precedence whose role ARN will  be
              used  in  the cognito:roles and cognito:preferred_role claims in
              the user's tokens. Groups with  higher  Precedence  values  take
              precedence over groups with lower Precedence values or with null
              Precedence values.

              Two groups can have the same Precedence value. If this  happens,
              neither  group  takes  precedence  over the other. If two groups
              with the same Precedence have the same role ARN,  that  role  is
              used  in the cognito:preferred_role claim in tokens for users in
              each group. If the two groups have different role ARNs, the cog-
              nito:preferred_role claim is not set in users' tokens.

              The default Precedence value is null.

          LastModifiedDate -> (timestamp)
              The date the group was last modified.

          CreationDate -> (timestamp)
              The date the group was created.
