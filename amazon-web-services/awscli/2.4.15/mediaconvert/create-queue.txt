SYNOPSIS
            create-queue
          [--description <value>]
          --name <value>
          [--pricing-plan <value>]
          [--reservation-plan-settings <value>]
          [--status <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --description (string) Optional. A description of the  queue  that  you
       are creating.

       --name (string) The name of the queue that you are creating.

       --pricing-plan  (string)  Specifies  whether  the  pricing plan for the
       queue is on-demand or reserved. For  on-demand,  you  pay  per  minute,
       billed  in  increments  of  .01  minute.  For reserved, you pay for the
       transcoding capacity of the entire queue, regardless of how much or how
       little  you  use  it.  Reserved pricing requires a 12-month commitment.
       When you use the API to create a queue, the default is on-demand.
          Possible values:

          o ON_DEMAND

          o RESERVED

       --reservation-plan-settings (structure) Details about the pricing  plan
       for  your reserved queue. Required for reserved queues and not applica-
       ble to on-demand queues.Commitment -> (string)
              The length of the term of your reserved queue pricing plan  com-
              mitment.

          RenewalType -> (string)
              Specifies  whether  the term of your reserved queue pricing plan
              is automatically extended (AUTO_RENEW) or  expires  (EXPIRE)  at
              the  end of the term. When your term is auto renewed, you extend
              your commitment by 12 months from the auto renew date.  You  can
              cancel this commitment.

          ReservedSlots -> (integer)
              Specifies  the number of reserved transcode slots (RTS) for this
              queue. The number of RTS determines how many jobs the queue  can
              process in parallel; each RTS can process one job at a time. You
              can't decrease the number of RTS in your reserved queue. You can
              increase the number of RTS by extending your existing commitment
              with a new 12-month commitment for the larger  number.  The  new
              commitment begins when you purchase the additional capacity. You
              can't cancel your commitment or revert to your original  commit-
              ment after you increase the capacity.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Commitment=string,RenewalType=string,ReservedSlots=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Commitment": "ONE_YEAR",
            "RenewalType": "AUTO_RENEW"|"EXPIRE",
            "ReservedSlots": integer
          }

       --status  (string)  Initial  state of the queue. If you create a paused
       queue, then jobs in that queue won't begin.
          Possible values:

          o ACTIVE

          o PAUSED

       --tags (map) The tags that you want to add to the resource. You can tag
       resources with a key-value pair or with only a key.key -> (string)
          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a custom queue

       The  following create-queue example creates a custom transcoding queue.

          aws mediaconvert create-queue \
              --endpoint-url https://abcd1234.mediaconvert.region-name-1.amazonaws.com \
              --region region-name-1 \
              --name Queue1 \
              --description "Keep this queue empty unless job is urgent."

       To get your account-specific endpoint, use describe-endpoints, or  send
       the command without the endpoint. The service returns an error and your
       endpoint.

       Output:

          {
              "Queue": {
                  "Status": "ACTIVE",
                  "Name": "Queue1",
                  "LastUpdated": 1518034928,
                  "Arn": "arn:aws:mediaconvert:region-name-1:012345678998:queues/Queue1",
                  "Type": "CUSTOM",
                  "CreatedAt": 1518034928,
                  "Description": "Keep this queue empty unless job is urgent."
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       Queue -> (structure)
          You  can  use  queues  to manage the resources that are available to
          your AWS account for running multiple transcoding jobs at  the  same
          time.  If  you  don't  specify  a  queue, the service sends all jobs
          through   the   default   queue.   For   more    information,    see
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/working-with-queues.html.

          Arn -> (string)
              An identifier for this resource that is  unique  within  all  of
              AWS.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp in epoch seconds for when you created the queue.

          Description -> (string)
              An optional description that you create for each queue.

          LastUpdated -> (timestamp)
              The  timestamp  in  epoch  seconds  for  when  you most recently
              updated the queue.

          Name -> (string)
              A name that you create for each queue. Each name must be  unique
              within your account.

          PricingPlan -> (string)
              Specifies whether the pricing plan for the queue is on-demand or
              reserved. For on-demand, you pay per minute,  billed  in  incre-
              ments  of  .01 minute. For reserved, you pay for the transcoding
              capacity of the entire queue, regardless of how much or how lit-
              tle you use it. Reserved pricing requires a 12-month commitment.

          ProgressingJobsCount -> (integer)
              The estimated number of jobs with a PROGRESSING status.

          ReservationPlan -> (structure)
              Details about the pricing plan for your reserved queue. Required
              for reserved queues and not applicable to on-demand queues.

              Commitment -> (string)
                 The  length  of  the term of your reserved queue pricing plan
                 commitment.

              ExpiresAt -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp in epoch seconds for when the  current  pricing
                 plan term for this reserved queue expires.

              PurchasedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  timestamp  in epoch seconds for when you set up the cur-
                 rent pricing plan for this reserved queue.

              RenewalType -> (string)
                 Specifies whether the term of  your  reserved  queue  pricing
                 plan   is  automatically  extended  (AUTO_RENEW)  or  expires
                 (EXPIRE) at the end of the term.

              ReservedSlots -> (integer)
                 Specifies the number of reserved transcode  slots  (RTS)  for
                 this  queue.  The  number of RTS determines how many jobs the
                 queue can process in parallel; each RTS can process  one  job
                 at  a  time.  When  you increase this number, you extend your
                 existing commitment with a  new  12-month  commitment  for  a
                 larger number of RTS. The new commitment begins when you pur-
                 chase the additional capacity. You can't decrease the  number
                 of RTS in your reserved queue.

              Status -> (string)
                 Specifies whether the pricing plan for your reserved queue is
                 ACTIVE or EXPIRED.

          Status -> (string)
              Queues can be ACTIVE or PAUSED. If you pause a queue,  the  ser-
              vice  won't  begin  processing jobs in that queue. Jobs that are
              running when you pause the queue continue to run until they fin-
              ish or result in an error.

          SubmittedJobsCount -> (integer)
              The estimated number of jobs with a SUBMITTED status.

          Type -> (string)
              Specifies whether this on-demand queue is system or custom. Sys-
              tem queues are built in.  You  can't  modify  or  delete  system
              queues. You can create and modify custom queues.
