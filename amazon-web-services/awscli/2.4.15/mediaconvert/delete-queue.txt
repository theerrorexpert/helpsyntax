DELETE-QUEUE()                                                  DELETE-QUEUE()



NAME
       delete-queue -

DESCRIPTION
       Permanently delete a queue you have created.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-queue
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string) The name of the queue that you want to delete.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a custom on-demand queue

       The   following  delete-queue  example  deletes  the  specified  custom
       on-demand queue.

       You can't delete your default queue. You can't delete a reserved  queue
       that has an active pricing plan or that contains unprocessed jobs.

          aws mediaconvert delete-queue \
              --name Customer1 \
              --endpoint-url https://abcd1234.mediaconvert.us-west-2.amazonaws.com

       This  command  produces  no output. Run aws mediaconvert list-queues to
       confirm that your queue was deleted.
