OPTIONS
       --acceleration-settings (structure) Accelerated transcoding can signif-
       icantly speed up jobs with long, visually complex content. Outputs that
       use  this feature incur pro-tier pricing. For information about feature
       limitations, see the AWS  Elemental  MediaConvert  User  Guide.Mode  ->
       (string)
          Specify  the  conditions  when  the  service  will run your job with
          accelerated transcoding.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Mode=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Mode": "DISABLED"|"ENABLED"|"PREFERRED"
          }

       --category (string) The new category for the job template, if  you  are
       changing it.

       --description (string) The new description for the job template, if you
       are changing it.

       --hop-destinations (list) Optional list of hop destinations.(structure)
          Optional. Configuration for a destination queue to which the job can
          hop once a customer-defined minimum wait time has passed.

          Priority -> (integer)
              Optional. When you set up a job to use queue  hopping,  you  can
              specify  a different relative priority for the job in the desti-
              nation queue. If you don't specify, the relative  priority  will
              remain the same as in the previous queue.

          Queue -> (string)
              Optional  unless the job is submitted on the default queue. When
              you set up a job to use queue hopping, you can specify a  desti-
              nation  queue.  This queue cannot be the original queue to which
              the job is submitted. If the original queue  isn't  the  default
              queue  and you don't specify the destination queue, the job will
              move to the default queue.

          WaitMinutes -> (integer)
              Required for setting up a job to use queue hopping. Minimum wait
              time  in minutes until the job can hop to the destination queue.
              Valid range is 1 to 1440 minutes, inclusive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Priority=integer,Queue=string,WaitMinutes=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Priority": integer,
              "Queue": "string",
              "WaitMinutes": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --name (string) The name of the job template you are modifying

       --priority (integer) Specify the relative priority for this job. In any
       given  queue,  the  service  begins processing the job with the highest
       value first. When more than one job has the same priority, the  service
       begins  processing the job that you submitted first. If you don't spec-
       ify a priority, the service uses the default value 0.

       --queue (string) The new queue for the job template, if you are  chang-
       ing it.

       --settings  (structure)  JobTemplateSettings contains all the transcode
       settings saved in the template that will be  applied  to  jobs  created
       from it.AdAvailOffset -> (integer)
              When  specified,  this  offset (in milliseconds) is added to the
              input Ad Avail PTS time.

          AvailBlanking -> (structure)
              Settings for ad avail blanking. Video can be blanked or overlaid
              with  an  image,  and  audio  muted  during SCTE-35 triggered ad
              avails.

              AvailBlankingImage -> (string)
                 Blanking image to be used. Leave empty for solid black.  Only
                 bmp and png images are supported.

          Esam -> (structure)
              Settings  for Event Signaling And Messaging (ESAM). If you don't
              do ad insertion, you can ignore these settings.

              ManifestConfirmConditionNotification -> (structure)
                 Specifies an ESAM ManifestConfirmConditionNotification XML as
                 per  OC-SP-ESAM-API-I03-131025. The transcoder uses the mani-
                 fest conditioning instructions that you provide in  the  set-
                 ting MCC XML (mccXml).

                 MccXml -> (string)
                     Provide  your  ESAM  ManifestConfirmConditionNotification
                     XML document inside your JSON job settings. Form the  XML
                     document as per OC-SP-ESAM-API-I03-131025. The transcoder
                     will use the Manifest Conditioning  instructions  in  the
                     message that you supply.

              ResponseSignalPreroll -> (integer)
                 Specifies  the  stream distance, in milliseconds, between the
                 SCTE 35 messages that the transcoder places  and  the  splice
                 points  that  they refer to. If the time between the start of
                 the asset and the SCTE-35 message is less  than  this  value,
                 then  the  transcoder places the SCTE-35 marker at the begin-
                 ning of the stream.

              SignalProcessingNotification -> (structure)
                 Specifies an ESAM  SignalProcessingNotification  XML  as  per
                 OC-SP-ESAM-API-I03-131025.  The  transcoder  uses  the signal
                 processing instructions that you provide in the  setting  SCC
                 XML (sccXml).

                 SccXml -> (string)
                     Provide  your ESAM SignalProcessingNotification XML docu-
                     ment inside your JSON job settings. Form the XML document
                     as per OC-SP-ESAM-API-I03-131025. The transcoder will use
                     the signal processing instructions in  the  message  that
                     you  supply.  Provide your ESAM SignalProcessingNotifica-
                     tion XML document inside your JSON job settings. For your
                     MPEG2-TS  file  outputs, if you want the service to place
                     SCTE-35 markers at the insertion points  you  specify  in
                     the  XML  document,  you  must  also  enable SCTE-35 ESAM
                     (scte35Esam). Note that you can either  specify  an  ESAM
                     XML  document or enable SCTE-35 passthrough. You can't do
                     both.

          ExtendedDataServices -> (structure)
              If your source content has EIA-608 Line 21 Data Services, enable
              this feature to specify what MediaConvert does with the Extended
              Data Services (XDS) packets. You can choose to pass through  XDS
              packets,  or  remove  them from the output. For more information
              about XDS, see EIA-608 Line Data Services, section  9.5.1.5  05h
              Content Advisory.

              CopyProtectionAction -> (string)
                 The  action  to  take  on copy and redistribution control XDS
                 packets. If you  select  PASSTHROUGH,  packets  will  not  be
                 changed.  If you select STRIP, any packets will be removed in
                 output captions.

              VchipAction -> (string)
                 The action to take on content advisory XDS  packets.  If  you
                 select  PASSTHROUGH,  packets  will  not  be  changed. If you
                 select STRIP, any packets will be removed in output captions.

          Inputs -> (list)
              Use  Inputs  (inputs)  to  define  the  source  file used in the
              transcode job. There can only be one input in  a  job  template.
              Using  the API, you can include multiple inputs when referencing
              a job template.

              (structure)
                 Specified video input in a template.

                 AudioSelectorGroups -> (map)
                     Use audio selector groups  to  combine  multiple  sidecar
                     audio inputs so that you can assign them to a single out-
                     put audio tab (AudioDescription). Note  that,  if  you're
                     working  with embedded audio, it's simpler to assign mul-
                     tiple input tracks into a single  audio  selector  rather
                     than use an audio selector group.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        Use  audio selector groups to combine multiple sidecar
                        audio inputs so that you can assign them to  a  single
                        output  audio  tab  (AudioDescription).  Note that, if
                        you're working with embedded audio,  it's  simpler  to
                        assign  multiple  input  tracks  into  a  single audio
                        selector rather than use an audio selector group.

                        AudioSelectorNames -> (list)
                            Name of an Audio Selector within the same input to
                            include  in  the  group.  Audio selector names are
                            standardized, based  on  their  order  within  the
                            input (e.g., "Audio Selector 1"). The audio selec-
                            tor name parameter can be repeated to add any num-
                            ber of audio selectors to the group.

                            (string)

                 AudioSelectors -> (map)
                     Use  Audio  selectors (AudioSelectors) to specify a track
                     or set of tracks from the input that you will use in your
                     outputs.  You can use multiple Audio selectors per input.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        Use Audio  selectors  (AudioSelectors)  to  specify  a
                        track  or  set  of tracks from the input that you will
                        use in your outputs. You can use multiple Audio selec-
                        tors per input.

                        CustomLanguageCode -> (string)
                            Selects  a  specific  language code from within an
                            audio source, using the ISO  639-2  or  ISO  639-3
                            three-letter language code

                        DefaultSelection -> (string)
                            Enable  this  setting on one audio selector to set
                            it as the default for the job.  The  service  uses
                            this  default  for outputs where it can't find the
                            specified input audio. If you don't set a default,
                            those outputs have no audio.

                        ExternalAudioFileInput -> (string)
                            Specifies audio data from an external file source.

                        HlsRenditionGroupSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings specific  to  audio  sources  in  an  HLS
                            alternate  rendition group. Specify the properties
                            (renditionGroupId, renditionName or  renditionLan-
                            guageCode)  to  identify  the  unique  audio track
                            among the alternative rendition groups present  in
                            the  HLS manifest. If no unique track is found, or
                            multiple tracks match the properties provided, the
                            job  fails.  If  no  properties  in  hlsRendition-
                            GroupSettings are  specified,  the  default  audio
                            track within the video segment is chosen. If there
                            is no audio within video segment, the  alternative
                            audio with DEFAULT=YES is chosen instead.

                            RenditionGroupId -> (string)
                               Optional. Specify alternative group ID

                            RenditionLanguageCode -> (string)
                               Optional.  Specify  ISO 639-2 or ISO 639-3 code
                               in the language property

                            RenditionName -> (string)
                               Optional. Specify media name

                        LanguageCode -> (string)
                            Selects a specific language code  from  within  an
                            audio source.

                        Offset -> (integer)
                            Specifies  a  time delta in milliseconds to offset
                            the audio from the input video.

                        Pids -> (list)
                            Selects a specific PID from within an audio source
                            (e.g. 257 selects PID 0x101).

                            (integer)

                        ProgramSelection -> (integer)
                            Use  this  setting  for input streams that contain
                            Dolby E, to have the service extract specific pro-
                            gram  data from the track. To select multiple pro-
                            grams, create multiple  selectors  with  the  same
                            Track  and  different Program numbers. In the con-
                            sole, this setting is visible when you set  Selec-
                            tor  type to Track. Choose the program number from
                            the dropdown list. If you are sending a JSON file,
                            provide the program ID, which is part of the audio
                            metadata. If your input file has  incorrect  meta-
                            data,  you  can  choose  All channels instead of a
                            program number to have the service ignore the pro-
                            gram  IDs  and  include  all  the  programs in the
                            track.

                        RemixSettings -> (structure)
                            Use these settings to reorder the  audio  channels
                            of one input to match those of another input. This
                            allows you to combine the two files into a  single
                            output, one after the other.

                            ChannelMapping -> (structure)
                               Channel  mapping  (ChannelMapping) contains the
                               group of fields that hold  the  remixing  value
                               for  each  channel, in dB. Specify remix values
                               to indicate how much of the content  from  your
                               input  audio  channel  you  want in your output
                               audio channels. Each instance of the InputChan-
                               nels  or  InputChannelsFineTune array specifies
                               these values for one output  channel.  Use  one
                               instance of this array for each output channel.
                               In the console, each  array  corresponds  to  a
                               column  in  the graphical depiction of the map-
                               ping matrix. The rows of the  graphical  matrix
                               correspond  to input channels. Valid values are
                               within the range from -60 (mute) through  6.  A
                               setting of 0 passes the input channel unchanged
                               to the output channel (no attenuation or ampli-
                               fication).  Use InputChannels or InputChannels-
                               FineTune to specify your  remix  values.  Don't
                               use both.

                               OutputChannels -> (list)
                                   In your JSON job specification, include one
                                   child  of  OutputChannels  for  each  audio
                                   channel  that you want in your output. Each
                                   child  should  contain  one   instance   of
                                   InputChannels or InputChannelsFineTune.

                                   (structure)

                                      InputChannels -> (list)
                                          Use  this  setting  to  specify your
                                          remix values when they are integers,
                                          such as -10, 0, or 4.

                                          Use  this  setting  to  specify your
                                          remix values when they have a  deci-
                                          mal   component,  such  as  -10.312,

                            ChannelsIn -> (integer)
                               Specify the number of audio channels from  your
                               input that you want to use in your output. With
                               remixing, you might combine or split  the  data
                               in these channels, so the number of channels in
                               your final output might be  different.  If  you
                               are doing both input channel mapping and output
                               channel mapping, the number of output  channels
                               in  your  input mapping must be the same as the
                               number of input channels in  your  output  map-
                               ping.

                            ChannelsOut -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  number of channels in this output
                               after remixing. Valid values: 1, 2, 4, 6,  8...
                               64.  (1  and  even  numbers  to 64.) If you are
                               doing both input  channel  mapping  and  output
                               channel  mapping, the number of output channels
                               in your input mapping must be the same  as  the
                               number  of  input  channels in your output map-

                        SelectorType -> (string)
                            Specifies the type of the audio selector.

                        Tracks -> (list)
                            Identify a track from the input audio  to  include
                            in  this selector by entering the track index num-
                            ber. To include several tracks in a  single  audio
                            selector,  specify  multiple  tracks  as  follows.
                            Using the console, enter a  comma-separated  list.
                            For  examle,  type  "1,2,3"  to  include  tracks 1
                            through 3. Specifying directly in  your  JSON  job
                            file,  provide  the track numbers in an array. For
                            example, "tracks": [1,2,3].

                            (integer)

                 CaptionSelectors -> (map)
                     Use captions selectors to specify the captions data  from
                     your  input  that you use in your outputs. You can use up
                     to 20 captions selectors per input.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        Use captions selectors to specify  the  captions  data
                        from  your input that you use in your outputs. You can
                        use up to 20 captions selectors per input.

                        CustomLanguageCode -> (string)
                            The specific  language  to  extract  from  source,
                            using the ISO 639-2 or ISO 639-3 three-letter lan-
                            guage code. If input  is  SCTE-27,  complete  this
                            field and/or PID to select the caption language to
                            extract. If input is DVB-Sub and output is Burn-in
                            or  SMPTE-TT,  complete  this  field and/or PID to
                            select the caption language to extract.  If  input
                            is DVB-Sub that is being passed through, omit this
                            field (and PID field); there is no way to  extract
                            a specific language with pass-through captions.

                        LanguageCode -> (string)
                            The  specific  language to extract from source. If
                            input is SCTE-27, complete this field  and/or  PID
                            to  select  the  caption  language  to extract. If
                            input  is  DVB-Sub  and  output  is   Burn-in   or
                            SMPTE-TT, complete this field and/or PID to select
                            the caption  language  to  extract.  If  input  is
                            DVB-Sub  that  is  being passed through, omit this
                            field (and PID field); there is no way to  extract
                            a specific language with pass-through captions.

                        SourceSettings -> (structure)
                            If  your  input  captions are SCC, TTML, STL, SMI,
                            SRT, or IMSC in an xml file, specify  the  URI  of
                            the input captions source file. If your input cap-
                            tions are IMSC in an IMF package, use TrackSource-
                            Settings instead of FileSoureSettings.

                            AncillarySourceSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings for ancillary captions source.

                                   Specify  whether this set of input captions
                                   appears in your outputs in both 608 and 708
                                   format.  If  you  choose  Upconvert (UPCON-
                                   VERT), MediaConvert includes  the  captions
                                   data  in  two  ways: it passes the 608 data
                                   through using the 608  compatibility  bytes
                                   fields  of  the  708  wrapper,  and it also
                                   translates the 608 data into 708.

                               SourceAncillaryChannelNumber -> (integer)
                                   Specifies the 608  channel  number  in  the
                                   ancillary  data track from which to extract
                                   captions. Unused for passthrough.

                               TerminateCaptions -> (string)
                                   By  default,  the  service  terminates  any
                                   unterminated  captions  at  the end of each
                                   input. If you want the caption to  continue
                                   onto your next input, disable this setting.

                            DvbSubSourceSettings -> (structure)
                               DVB Sub Source Settings

                                   SMPTE-TT,  use this PID for the source con-
                                   tent. Unused for DVB-Sub  passthrough.  All
                                   DVB-Sub  content is passed through, regard-
                                   less of selectors.

                            EmbeddedSourceSettings -> (structure)

                                   translates the 608 data into 708.

                               Source608ChannelNumber -> (integer)
                                   Specifies the 608/708 channel number within
                                   the video track from which to extract  cap-
                                   tions. Unused for passthrough.

                                   Specifies  the  video  track index used for
                                   extracting captions. The system  only  sup-
                                   ports one input video track, so this should
                                   always be set to '1'.

                               TerminateCaptions -> (string)
                                   By  default,  the  service  terminates  any

                                   job specification, use the settings framer-
                                   ateNumerator and framerateDenominator.  For
                                   example,  you  might  specify 24 / 1 for 24
                                   fps, 25 / 1 for 25 fps, 24000  /  1001  for

                                      along with the setting Framerate denomi-
                                      nator (framerateDenominator).

                               SourceFile -> (string)
                                   External caption file used for loading cap-
                                   tions.  Accepted file extensions are 'scc',
                                   'ttml', 'dfxp', 'stl', 'srt', 'xml', 'smi',
                                   'webvtt', and 'vtt'.

                               TimeDelta -> (integer)
                                   Optional. Use this setting when you need to
                                   adjust the sync between your  sidecar  cap-
                                   tions and your video. For more information,
                                   see
                                   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/time-delta-use-cases.html.
                                   Enter a positive or negative number to mod-
                                   ify  the  times  in  the captions file. For
                                   example, type 15 to add 15 seconds  to  all
                                   the  times in the captions file. Type -5 to
                                   subtract 5 seconds from the  times  in  the
                                   captions  file.  You can optionally specify
                                   your time delta in milliseconds instead  of
                                   seconds.  When  you  do so, set the related
                                   setting, Time delta units  (TimeDeltaUnits)
                                   to  Milliseconds (MILLISECONDS). Note that,
                                   when you specify a  time  delta  for  time-
                                   code-based caption sources, such as SCC and
                                   STL, and your time delta isn't  a  multiple
                                   of the input frame rate, MediaConvert snaps
                                   the captions  to  the  nearest  frame.  For
                                   example,  when  your input video frame rate
                                   is 25 fps and you specify 1010ms  for  time
                                   delta, MediaConvert delays your captions by
                                   1000 ms.

                               TimeDeltaUnits -> (string)
                                   When  you  use  the  setting   Time   delta
                                   (TimeDelta) to adjust the sync between your
                                   sidecar captions and your video,  use  this
                                   setting  to specify the units for the delta
                                   that you specify. When you don't specify  a
                                   value  for  Time  delta  units (TimeDeltaU-
                                   nits),   MediaConvert   uses   seconds   by
                                   default.

                            SourceType -> (string)
                               Use  Source (SourceType) to identify the format
                               of your  input  captions.  The  service  cannot
                               auto-detect caption format.

                            TeletextSourceSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings  specific to Teletext caption sources,
                               including Page number.

                               PageNumber -> (string)
                                   Use Page Number (PageNumber) to specify the
                                   three-digit  hexadecimal  page  number that
                                   will be used for Teletext captions. Do  not
                                   use this setting if you are passing through
                                   teletext from the input source to output.

                            TrackSourceSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings specific to caption sources  that  are
                               specified  by  track number. Currently, this is
                               only IMSC captions in an IMF package.  If  your
                               caption  source  is  IMSC 1.1 in a separate xml
                               file, use FileSourceSettings instead of  Track-
                               SourceSettings.

                               TrackNumber -> (integer)
                                   Use  this  setting  to select a single cap-
                                   tions track from a  source.  Track  numbers
                                   correspond  to  the  order  in the captions
                                   source file. For IMF sources, track number-
                                   ing is based on the order that the captions
                                   appear in the CPL. For example,  use  1  to
                                   select  the  captions  asset that is listed
                                   first in the CPL. To include more than  one
                                   captions  track in your job outputs, create
                                   multiple input captions selectors.  Specify
                                   one track per selector.

                            WebvttHlsSourceSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings  specific  to  WebVTT  sources  in HLS
                               alternative rendition group. Specify the  prop-
                               erties (renditionGroupId, renditionName or ren-
                               ditionLanguageCode) to identify the unique sub-
                               title  track  among  the  alternative rendition
                               groups present  in  the  HLS  manifest.  If  no
                               unique track is found, or multiple tracks match
                               the specified properties,  the  job  fails.  If
                               there  is only one subtitle track in the rendi-
                               tion group, the settings can be left empty  and
                               the  default  subtitle track will be chosen. If
                               your caption source  is  a  sidecar  file,  use
                               FileSourceSettings  instead of WebvttHlsSource-
                               Settings.

                               RenditionGroupId -> (string)
                                   Optional. Specify alternative group ID

                               RenditionLanguageCode -> (string)
                                   Optional. Specify ISO 639-2  or  ISO  639-3
                                   code in the language property

                               RenditionName -> (string)
                                   Optional. Specify media name

                 Crop -> (structure)
                     Use  Cropping  selection (crop) to specify the video area
                     that the service will include in the output video  frame.
                     If  you  specify a value here, it will override any value
                     that you specify in the output setting Cropping selection
                     (crop).

                     Height -> (integer)
                        Height  of rectangle in pixels. Specify only even num-
                        bers.

                     Width -> (integer)
                        Width of rectangle in pixels. Specify only  even  num-
                        bers.

                     X -> (integer)
                        The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and the
                        left edge of the video frame. Specify only  even  num-
                        bers.

                     Y -> (integer)
                        The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and the
                        top edge of the video frame. Specify  only  even  num-
                        bers.

                 DeblockFilter -> (string)
                     Enable  Deblock  (InputDeblockFilter) to produce smoother
                     motion in the output. Default is disabled. Only  manually
                     controllable for MPEG2 and uncompressed video inputs.

                 DenoiseFilter -> (string)
                     Enable  Denoise (InputDenoiseFilter) to filter noise from
                     the input. Default is disabled. Only applicable to MPEG2,
                     H.264, H.265, and uncompressed video inputs.

                 DolbyVisionMetadataXml -> (string)
                     Use  this  setting  only when your video source has Dolby
                     Vision studio mastering metadata that  is  carried  in  a
                     separate XML file. Specify the Amazon S3 location for the
                     metadata XML file. MediaConvert uses this file to provide
                     global  and frame-level metadata for Dolby Vision prepro-
                     cessing. When you specify a file here and your input also
                     has  interleaved  global and frame level metadata, Media-
                     Convert ignores the interleaved metadata  and  uses  only
                     the  the  metadata from this external XML file. Note that
                     your IAM service role must grant MediaConvert  read  per-
                     missions   to   this  file.  For  more  information,  see
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/iam-role.html.

                 FilterEnable -> (string)
                     Specify  how  the transcoding service applies the denoise
                     and deblock filters. You must  also  enable  the  filters
                     separately, with Denoise (InputDenoiseFilter) and Deblock
                     (InputDeblockFilter). * Auto -  The  transcoding  service
                     determines whether to apply filtering, depending on input
                     type and quality. * Disable - The input is not  filtered.
                     This  is  true  even if you use the API to enable them in
                     (InputDeblockFilter) and (InputDeblockFilter). * Force  -
                     The input is filtered regardless of input type.

                 FilterStrength -> (integer)
                     Use Filter strength (FilterStrength) to adjust the magni-
                     tude the input filter settings (Deblock and Denoise). The
                     range is -5 to 5. Default is 0.

                 ImageInserter -> (structure)
                     Enable  the  image  inserter feature to include a graphic
                     overlay on your video. Enable or disable this feature for
                     each  input  individually.  This  setting  is disabled by
                     default.

                     InsertableImages -> (list)
                        Specify the images that you want to  overlay  on  your
                        video. The images must be PNG or TGA files.

                        (structure)
                            These  settings  apply to a specific graphic over-
                            lay. You can include  multiple  overlays  in  your
                            job.

                            Duration -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  time,  in  milliseconds,  for the
                               image to remain on the output video. This dura-
                               tion  includes  fade-in  time  but not fade-out
                               time.

                            FadeIn -> (integer)
                               Specify the length of  time,  in  milliseconds,
                               between the Start time that you specify for the
                               image insertion and the  time  that  the  image
                               appears  at  full  opacity. Full opacity is the
                               level that you specify for the opacity setting.
                               If  you  don't specify a value for Fade-in, the
                               image will appear abruptly at the overlay start
                               time.

                            FadeOut -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  length  of time, in milliseconds,
                               between the end of the time that you have spec-
                               ified  for  the image overlay Duration and when
                               the overlaid image has faded  to  total  trans-
                               parency.  If  you  don't  specify  a  value for
                               Fade-out, the image will disappear abruptly  at
                               the end of the inserted image duration.

                            Height -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  height  of  the inserted image in
                               pixels. If you specify a  value  that's  larger
                               than  the  video resolution height, the service
                               will crop your overlaid image to  fit.  To  use
                               the  native height of the image, keep this set-
                               ting blank.

                            ImageInserterInput -> (string)
                               Specify the HTTP, HTTPS, or Amazon S3  location
                               of  the  image  that you want to overlay on the
                               video. Use a PNG or TGA file.

                            ImageX -> (integer)
                               Specify the distance, in  pixels,  between  the
                               inserted  image  and the left edge of the video
                               frame. Required for any image overlay that  you
                               specify.

                            ImageY -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  distance,  in pixels, between the
                               overlaid image and the top edge  of  the  video
                               frame.  Required for any image overlay that you
                               specify.

                            Layer -> (integer)
                               Specify how overlapping inserted images appear.
                               Images  with  higher values for Layer appear on
                               top of images with lower values for Layer.

                            Opacity -> (integer)
                               Use Opacity (Opacity) to specify  how  much  of
                               the underlying video shows through the inserted
                               image.  0  is  transparent  and  100  is  fully
                               opaque. Default is 50.

                            StartTime -> (string)
                               Specify the timecode of the frame that you want
                               the overlay to first appear on. This must be in
                               timecode  (HH:MM:SS:FF  or HH:MM:SS;FF) format.
                               Remember to take  into  account  your  timecode
                               source settings.

                            Width -> (integer)
                               Specify the width of the inserted image in pix-
                               els. If you specify a value that's larger  than
                               the  video  resolution  width, the service will
                               crop your overlaid image to  fit.  To  use  the
                               native  width  of  the image, keep this setting
                               blank.

                 InputClippings -> (list)
                     (InputClippings) contains sets of  start  and  end  times
                     that  together  specify a portion of the input to be used
                     in the outputs. If you provide only  a  start  time,  the
                     clip will be the entire input from that point to the end.
                     If you provide only an end time, it will  be  the  entire
                     input  up  to  that point. When you specify more than one
                     input clip, the transcoding service creates the job  out-
                     puts  by  stringing  the  clips together in the order you
                     specify them.

                     (structure)
                        To transcode only portions of your input, include  one
                        input  clip  for each part of your input that you want
                        in your output. All input clips that you specify  will
                        be  included  in  every  output  of  the job. For more
                        information,                                       see
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/assembling-multiple-inputs-and-input-clips.html.

                        EndTimecode -> (string)
                            Set End timecode (EndTimecode) to the end  of  the
                            portion  of  the input you are clipping. The frame
                            corresponding  to  the  End  timecode   value   is
                            included  in the clip. Start timecode or End time-
                            code may be left blank, but not both. Use the for-
                            mat  HH:MM:SS:FF  or  HH:MM:SS;FF, where HH is the
                            hour, MM is the minute, SS is the second,  and  FF
                            is  the  frame  number.  When choosing this value,
                            take into account your setting for timecode source
                            under  input  settings  (InputTimecodeSource). For
                            example, if you have embedded timecodes that start
                            at  01:00:00:00  and you want your clip to end six
                            minutes into the video, use 01:06:00:00.

                        StartTimecode -> (string)
                            Set Start timecode (StartTimecode) to  the  begin-
                            ning of the portion of the input you are clipping.
                            The frame  corresponding  to  the  Start  timecode
                            value  is  included in the clip. Start timecode or
                            End timecode may be left blank, but not both.  Use
                            the format HH:MM:SS:FF or HH:MM:SS;FF, where HH is
                            the hour, MM is the minute, SS is the second,  and
                            FF  is the frame number. When choosing this value,
                            take into account your setting for Input  timecode
                            source.  For  example,  if you have embedded time-
                            codes that start at 01:00:00:00 and you want  your
                            clip  to  begin  five  minutes into the video, use
                            01:05:00:00.

                 InputScanType -> (string)
                     When you have a progressive segmented frame (PsF)  input,
                     use  this  setting to flag the input as PsF. MediaConvert
                     doesn't automatically  detect  PsF.  Therefore,  flagging
                     your input as PsF results in better preservation of video
                     quality when you do deinterlacing and frame rate  conver-
                     sion.  If  you  don't  specify, the default value is Auto
                     (AUTO). Auto is the correct setting for all  inputs  that
                     are  not PsF. Don't set this value to PsF when your input
                     is interlaced. Doing so  creates  horizontal  interlacing
                     artifacts.

                 Position -> (structure)
                     Use  Selection  placement  (position) to define the video
                     area in your output frame. The area outside of  the  rec-
                     tangle  that  you specify here is black. If you specify a
                     value here, it will override any value that  you  specify
                     in  the output setting Selection placement (position). If
                     you specify a value here, this will override any AFD val-
                     ues  in  your  input,  even  if  you  set  Respond to AFD
                     (RespondToAfd) to Respond (RESPOND).  If  you  specify  a
                     value  here,  this  will ignore anything that you specify
                     for the setting Scaling Behavior (scalingBehavior).

                     Height -> (integer)
                        Height of rectangle in pixels. Specify only even  num-
                        bers.

                     Width -> (integer)
                        Width  of  rectangle in pixels. Specify only even num-
                        bers.

                     X -> (integer)
                        The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and the
                        left  edge  of the video frame. Specify only even num-
                        bers.

                     Y -> (integer)
                        The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and the
                        top  edge  of  the video frame. Specify only even num-
                        bers.

                 ProgramNumber -> (integer)
                     Use Program (programNumber) to select a specific  program
                     from  within  a multi-program transport stream. Note that
                     Quad 4K is not currently supported. Default is the  first
                     program  within  the transport stream. If the program you
                     specify doesn't exist, the transcoding service  will  use
                     this default.

                 PsiControl -> (string)
                     Set  PSI  control  (InputPsiControl) for transport stream
                     inputs to specify which data the demux process to  scans.
                     *  Ignore  PSI - Scan all PIDs for audio and video. * Use
                     PSI - Scan only PSI data.

                 TimecodeSource -> (string)
                     Use this Timecode source setting, located under the input
                     settings  (InputTimecodeSource),  to specify how the ser-
                     vice counts input video frames. This  input  frame  count
                     affects  only  the  behavior  of features that apply to a
                     single input at a time, such as input clipping  and  syn-
                     chronizing some captions formats. Choose Embedded (EMBED-
                     DED) to use the timecodes in  your  input  video.  Choose
                     Start  at  zero  (ZEROBASED)  to start the first frame at
                     zero. Choose Specified start  (SPECIFIEDSTART)  to  start
                     the  first  frame at the timecode that you specify in the
                     setting Start  timecode  (timecodeStart).  If  you  don't
                     specify a value for Timecode source, the service will use
                     Embedded by default. For  more  information  about  time-
                     codes,                                                see
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/mediaconvert/timecode.

                 TimecodeStart -> (string)
                     Specify the timecode that you want the service to use for
                     this input's initial frame. To use this setting, you must
                     set  the Timecode source setting, located under the input
                     settings (InputTimecodeSource), to Specified start (SPEC-
                     IFIEDSTART).  For  more  information about timecodes, see
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/mediaconvert/timecode.

                 VideoSelector -> (structure)
                     Input  video selectors contain the video settings for the
                     input. Each of your inputs  can  have  up  to  one  video
                     selector.

                     AlphaBehavior -> (string)
                        Ignore  this  setting unless this input is a QuickTime
                        animation with an alpha channel. Use this  setting  to
                        create  separate Key and Fill outputs. In each output,
                        specify which part of  the  input  MediaConvert  uses.
                        Leave  this  setting  at  the default value DISCARD to
                        delete the alpha channel and preserve the  video.  Set
                        it  to  REMAP_TO_LUMA  to delete the video and map the
                        alpha channel to the luma channel of your outputs.

                     ColorSpace -> (string)
                        If your input video has accurate color space metadata,
                        or if you don't know about color space, leave this set
                        to the default value Follow (FOLLOW). The service will
                        automatically  detect  your input color space. If your
                        input video has metadata indicating  the  wrong  color
                        space,  specify the accurate color space here. If your
                        input video is HDR 10 and the SMPTE ST 2086  Mastering
                        Display  Color Volume static metadata isn't present in
                        your video stream, or if that metadata is present  but
                        not  accurate,  choose Force HDR 10 (FORCE_HDR10) here
                        and specify correct values in the input HDR  10  meta-
                        data  (Hdr10Metadata)  settings.  For more information
                        about      MediaConvert      HDR       jobs,       see
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/mediaconvert/hdr.

                     ColorSpaceUsage -> (string)
                        There are two sources for color  metadata,  the  input
                        file  and  the  job  input  settings Color space (Col-
                        orSpace)  and  HDR  master  display  information  set-
                        tings(Hdr10Metadata).  The  Color  space usage setting
                        determines  which  takes  precedence.   Choose   Force
                        (FORCE)  to use color metadata from the input job set-
                        tings. If you don't specify values for those settings,
                        the  service  defaults  to  using  metadata  from your
                        input. FALLBACK - Choose Fallback  (FALLBACK)  to  use
                        color  metadata from the source when it is present. If
                        there's no color metadata in your input file, the ser-
                        vice defaults to using values you specify in the input
                        settings.

                     Hdr10Metadata -> (structure)
                        Use these settings to provide HDR 10 metadata that  is
                        missing or inaccurate in your input video. Appropriate
                        values vary depending on the input video and  must  be
                        provided by a color grader. The color grader generates
                        these values during the HDR 10 mastering process.  The
                        valid range for each of these settings is 0 to 50,000.
                        Each increment represents  0.00002  in  CIE1931  color
                        coordinate.  Related settings - When you specify these
                        values, you must also set Color space (ColorSpace)  to
                        HDR  10 (HDR10). To specify whether the the values you
                        specify here take precedence over the  values  in  the
                        metadata  of  your  input  file, set Color space usage
                        (ColorSpaceUsage). To specify whether  color  metadata
                        is  included  in  an  output, set Color metadata (Col-
                        orMetadata). For more information  about  MediaConvert
                        HDR                      jobs,                     see

                        BluePrimaryX -> (integer)
                            HDR Master Display Information must be provided by
                            a color grader, using color grading  tools.  Range
                            is  0 to 50,000, each increment represents 0.00002
                            in CIE1931 color coordinate. Note that  this  set-
                            ting is not for color correction.

                        BluePrimaryY -> (integer)
                            HDR Master Display Information must be provided by
                            a color grader, using color grading  tools.  Range

                     Pid -> (integer)
                        Use  PID  (Pid)  to select specific video data from an
                        input file. Specify this value as an integer; the sys-
                        tem  automatically  converts  it  to  the  hexidecimal
                        value. For example, 257 selects PID 0x101. A  PID,  or
                        packet  identifier, is an identifier for a set of data
                        in an MPEG-2 transport stream container.

                     ProgramNumber -> (integer)
                        Selects a specific program from within a multi-program
                        transport  stream.  Note that Quad 4K is not currently
                        supported.

                     Rotate -> (string)
                        Use Rotate (InputRotate) to specify  how  the  service
                        rotates  your video. You can choose automatic rotation
                        or specify a rotation. You  can  specify  a  clockwise
                        rotation  of 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees. If your input
                        video container is .mov or .mp4  and  your  input  has
                        rotation  metadata,  you  can choose Automatic to have
                        the service rotate your video according to  the  rota-
                        tion  specified  in the metadata. The rotation must be
                        within one degree of 90, 180, or 270 degrees.  If  the
                        rotation  metadata  specifies  any other rotation, the
                        service will default to no rotation. By  default,  the
                        service does no rotation, even if your input video has
                        rotation metadata. The service  doesn't  pass  through
                        rotation metadata.

                     SampleRange -> (string)
                        If  the  sample  range metadata in your input video is
                        accurate, or if you don't  know  about  sample  range,
                        keep the default value, Follow (FOLLOW), for this set-
                        ting. When you do, the service  automatically  detects
                        your input sample range. If your input video has meta-
                        data indicating the wrong sample  range,  specify  the
                        accurate  sample range here. When you do, MediaConvert
                        ignores any sample  range  information  in  the  input
                        metadata.  Regardless of whether MediaConvert uses the
                        input sample range or the sample range that you  spec-
                        ify,  MediaConvert uses the sample range for transcod-
                        ing and also writes it to the output metadata.

          KantarWatermark -> (structure)
              Use these settings only when you use Kantar watermarking.  Spec-
              ify the values that MediaConvert uses to generate and place Kan-
              tar watermarks in your output audio.  These  settings  apply  to
              every  output  in your job. In addition to specifying these val-
              ues, you also need to  store  your  Kantar  credentials  in  AWS
              Secrets      Manager.      For     more     information,     see
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/kantar-watermarking.html.

              ChannelName -> (string)
                 Provide an audio channel name from your Kantar audio license.

              ContentReference -> (string)
                 Specify a unique identifier for Kantar to use for this  piece
                 of content.

              CredentialsSecretName -> (string)
                 Provide the name of the AWS Secrets Manager secret where your
                 Kantar credentials are stored. Note  that  your  MediaConvert
                 service  role  must  provide  access to this secret. For more
                 information,                                              see
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/granting-permissions-for-mediaconvert-to-access-secrets-manager-secret.html.

                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/tutorials_basic.html,
                 in the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide.

              FileOffset -> (double)
                 Optional. Specify an offset, in whole seconds, from the start
                 of  your  output  and the beginning of the watermarking. When
                 you don't specify an offset, Kantar defaults to zero.

              KantarLicenseId -> (integer)
                 Provide your Kantar license ID number. You  should  get  this
                 number from Kantar.

              KantarServerUrl -> (string)
                 Provide  the  HTTPS endpoint to the Kantar server. You should
                 get this endpoint from Kantar.

              LogDestination -> (string)
                 Optional. Specify the Amazon S3 bucket where you want  Media-
                 Convert  to  store  your  Kantar watermark XML logs. When you
                 don't specify a bucket, MediaConvert doesn't save these logs.
                 Note  that your MediaConvert service role must provide access
                 to    this    location.    For    more    information,    see
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/iam-role.html

              Metadata3 -> (string)
                 You can optionally use this field to specify the first  time-
                 stamp that Kantar embeds during watermarking. Kantar suggests
                 that you be very cautious when using this Kantar feature, and
                 that  you  use  it only on channels that are managed specifi-
                 cally for use with this feature by your Audience  Measurement
                 Operator.  For  more  information about this feature, contact
                 Kantar technical support.

              Metadata4 -> (string)
                 Additional metadata that MediaConvert sends to Kantar.  Maxi-
                 mum length is 50 characters.

              Metadata5 -> (string)
                 Additional  metadata that MediaConvert sends to Kantar. Maxi-
                 mum length is 50 characters.

              Metadata6 -> (string)
                 Additional metadata that MediaConvert sends to Kantar.  Maxi-
                 mum length is 50 characters.

              Metadata7 -> (string)
                 Additional  metadata that MediaConvert sends to Kantar. Maxi-
                 mum length is 50 characters.

              Metadata8 -> (string)
                 Additional metadata that MediaConvert sends to Kantar.  Maxi-
                 mum length is 50 characters.

          MotionImageInserter -> (structure)
              Overlay  motion graphics on top of your video. The motion graph-
              ics that you specify here appear on all outputs  in  all  output
              groups.         For         more         information,        see
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/motion-graphic-overlay.html.

              Framerate -> (structure)
                 If  your  motion graphic asset is a .mov file, keep this set-
                 ting unspecified. If your motion graphic asset is a series of
                 .png  files,  specify the frame rate of the overlay in frames
                 per second, as a fraction. For example,  specify  24  fps  as
                 24/1.  Make  sure  that  the  number of images in your series
                 matches the frame rate and your  intended  overlay  duration.
                 For  example,  if you want a 30-second overlay at 30 fps, you
                 should have 900 .png images. This overlay frame rate  doesn't
                 need to match the frame rate of the underlying video.

                 FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                     The  bottom  of  the fraction that expresses your overlay
                     frame rate. For example, if your frame rate  is  24  fps,
                     set this value to 1.

                 FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                     The top of the fraction that expresses your overlay frame
                     rate. For example, if your frame rate is 24 fps, set this
                     value to 24.

              Input -> (string)
                 Specify  the  .mov file or series of .png files that you want
                 to overlay on your video. For .png files,  provide  the  file
                 name  of  the  first  file  in the series. Make sure that the
                 names of the .png files  end  with  sequential  numbers  that
                 specify the order that they are played in. For example, over-
                 lay_000.png, overlay_001.png, overlay_002.png, and so on. The
                 sequence  must  start  at zero, and each image file name must
                 have the same number of digits. Pad your initial  file  names
                 with  enough  zeros to complete the sequence. For example, if
                 the first image is overlay_0.png, there can be only 10 images
                 in the sequence, with the last image being overlay_9.png. But
                 if the first image is overlay_00.png, there can be 100 images
                 in the sequence.

              InsertionMode -> (string)
                 Choose  the type of motion graphic asset that you are provid-
                 ing for your overlay. You can choose either a .mov file or  a
                 series of .png files.

              Offset -> (structure)
                 Use  Offset  to  specify the placement of your motion graphic
                 overlay on the video  frame.  Specify  in  pixels,  from  the
                 upper-left  corner of the frame. If you don't specify an off-
                 set, the service scales your overlay to the full size of  the
                 frame.  Otherwise,  the  service  inserts  the overlay at its
                 native resolution and scales the size up  or  down  with  any
                 video scaling.

                 ImageX -> (integer)
                     Set  the distance, in pixels, between the overlay and the
                     left edge of the video frame.

                 ImageY -> (integer)
                     Set the distance, in pixels, between the overlay and  the
                     top edge of the video frame.

              Playback -> (string)
                 Specify whether your motion graphic overlay repeats on a loop
                 or plays only once.

              StartTime -> (string)
                 Specify when the motion overlay begins. Use  timecode  format
                 (HH:MM:SS:FF or HH:MM:SS;FF). Make sure that the timecode you
                 provide here takes into account how  you  have  set  up  your
                 timecode configuration under both job settings and input set-
                 tings. The simplest way to do that is to set both to start at
                 0.  If you need to set up your job to follow timecodes embed-
                 ded in your source that don't start at zero, make  sure  that
                 you  specify  a  start  time that is after the first embedded
                 timecode. For  more  information,  see  https://docs.aws.ama-
                 zon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/setting-up-timecode.html  Find
                 job-wide and input timecode configuration  settings  in  your
                 JSON  job  settings  specification  at  settings>timecodeCon-
                 fig>source and settings>inputs>timecodeSource.

          NielsenConfiguration -> (structure)
              Settings for your Nielsen configuration. If you don't do Nielsen
              measurement  and  analytics,  ignore  these  settings.  When you
              enable Nielsen configuration  (nielsenConfiguration),  MediaCon-
              vert  enables  PCM to ID3 tagging for all outputs in the job. To
              enable  Nielsen  configuration  programmatically,   include   an
              instance of nielsenConfiguration in your JSON job specification.
              Even if you don't include any children of  nielsenConfiguration,
              you still enable the setting.

              BreakoutCode -> (integer)
                 Nielsen has discontinued the use of breakout code functional-
                 ity. If you must include this  property,  set  the  value  to
                 zero.

              DistributorId -> (string)
                 Use Distributor ID (DistributorID) to specify the distributor
                 ID that is assigned to your organization by Neilsen.

          NielsenNonLinearWatermark -> (structure)
              Ignore these settings unless you are  using  Nielsen  non-linear
              watermarking.  Specify the values that MediaConvert uses to gen-
              erate and place Nielsen watermarks  in  your  output  audio.  In
              addition  to  specifying  these  values, you also need to set up
              your cloud TIC server. These settings apply to every  output  in
              your  job. The MediaConvert implementation is currently with the
              following Nielsen versions: Nielsen Watermark SDK Version  5.2.1
              Nielsen  NLM  Watermark  Engine  Version 1.2.7 Nielsen Watermark
              Authenticator [SID_TIC] Version [5.0.0]

              ActiveWatermarkProcess -> (string)
                 Choose the type of Nielsen watermarks that you want  in  your
                 outputs.  When  you  choose NAES 2 and NW (NAES2_AND_NW), you
                 must provide a value for the setting SID (sourceId). When you
                 choose  CBET (CBET), you must provide a value for the setting
                 CSID (cbetSourceId). When you choose NAES  2,  NW,  and  CBET
                 (NAES2_AND_NW_AND_CBET),  you must provide values for both of
                 these settings.

              AdiFilename -> (string)
                 Optional. Use this setting  when  you  want  the  service  to
                 include  an  ADI  file  in the Nielsen metadata .zip file. To
                 provide an ADI file, store it in Amazon S3 and provide a  URL
                 to  it  here.  The  URL  should  be  in the following format:
                 S3://bucket/path/ADI-file. For  more  information  about  the
                 metadata  .zip  file,  see  the  setting Metadata destination
                 (metadataDestination).

              AssetId -> (string)
                 Use the asset ID that you  provide  to  Nielsen  to  uniquely
                 identify  this  asset.  Required  for  all Nielsen non-linear
                 watermarking.

              AssetName -> (string)
                 Use the asset name that  you  provide  to  Nielsen  for  this
                 asset. Required for all Nielsen non-linear watermarking.

              CbetSourceId -> (string)
                 Use  the  CSID that Nielsen provides to you. This CBET source
                 ID should be unique to your Nielsen account but common to all
                 of  your  output assets that have CBET watermarking. Required
                 when you choose a  value  for  the  setting  Watermark  types
                 (ActiveWatermarkProcess) that includes CBET.

              EpisodeId -> (string)
                 Optional. If this asset uses an episode ID with Nielsen, pro-
                 vide it here.

              MetadataDestination -> (string)
                 Specify the Amazon S3 location where you want MediaConvert to
                 save  your Nielsen non-linear metadata .zip file. This Amazon
                 S3 bucket must be in the same Region as the one where you  do
                 your  MediaConvert transcoding. If you want to include an ADI
                 file in this .zip file, use the setting  ADI  file  (adiFile-
                 name)  to specify it. MediaConvert delivers the Nielsen meta-
                 data .zip files only to your metadata destination  Amazon  S3
                 bucket. It doesn't deliver the .zip files to Nielsen. You are
                 responsible  for  delivering  the  metadata  .zip  files   to
                 Nielsen.

              SourceId -> (integer)
                 Use  the  SID  that  Nielsen  provides to you. This source ID
                 should be unique to your Nielsen account but common to all of
                 your  output  assets.  Required  for  all  Nielsen non-linear
                 watermarking. This  ID  should  be  unique  to  your  Nielsen
                 account but common to all of your output assets. Required for
                 all Nielsen non-linear watermarking.

              SourceWatermarkStatus -> (string)
                 Required. Specify whether your source  content  already  con-
                 tains  Nielsen non-linear watermarks. When you set this value
                 to Watermarked (WATERMARKED),  the  service  fails  the  job.
                 Nielsen requires that you add non-linear watermarking to only
                 clean content that doesn't already  have  non-linear  Nielsen
                 watermarks.

              TicServerUrl -> (string)
                 Specify  the  endpoint  for  the  TIC  server  that  you have
                 deployed and configured in the AWS Cloud.  Required  for  all
                 Nielsen  non-linear  watermarking. MediaConvert can't connect
                 directly to a TIC server. Instead, you must use  API  Gateway
                 to provide a RESTful interface between MediaConvert and a TIC
                 server that you deploy in your AWS account. For more informa-
                 tion  on  deploying  a TIC server in your AWS account and the
                 required API Gateway, contact Nielsen support.

              UniqueTicPerAudioTrack -> (string)
                 To create assets that have the same TIC values in each  audio
                 track,     keep     the     default    value    Share    TICs
                 (SAME_TICS_PER_TRACK). To create assets that have unique  TIC
                 values   for   each  audio  track,  choose  Use  unique  TICs
                 (RESERVE_UNIQUE_TICS_PER_TRACK).

          OutputGroups -> (list)
              (OutputGroups) contains one group of settings for  each  set  of
              outputs  that  share a common package type. All unpackaged files
              (MPEG-4, MPEG-2  TS,  Quicktime,  MXF,  and  no  container)  are
              grouped  in  a single output group as well. Required in (Output-
              Groups) is a group of settings that apply to  the  whole  group.
              This  required  object  depends  on the value you set for (Type)
              under   (OutputGroups)>(OutputGroupSettings).   Type,   settings
              object  pairs  are  as  follows.  *  FILE_GROUP_SETTINGS,  File-
              GroupSettings   *   HLS_GROUP_SETTINGS,    HlsGroupSettings    *
              DASH_ISO_GROUP_SETTINGS,          DashIsoGroupSettings         *
              MS_SMOOTH_GROUP_SETTINGS,        MsSmoothGroupSettings         *
              CMAF_GROUP_SETTINGS, CmafGroupSettings

              (structure)
                 Group of outputs

                 AutomatedEncodingSettings -> (structure)
                     Use  automated  encoding to have MediaConvert choose your
                     encoding settings for you, based  on  characteristics  of
                     your input video.

                     AbrSettings -> (structure)
                        Use automated ABR to have MediaConvert set up the ren-
                        ditions in your ABR  package  for  you  automatically,
                        based  on  characteristics  of  your input video. This
                        feature optimizes video quality while  minimizing  the
                        overall size of your ABR package.

                        MaxAbrBitrate -> (integer)
                            Optional. The maximum target bit rate used in your
                            automated ABR stack. Use  this  value  to  set  an
                            upper limit on the bandwidth consumed by the high-
                            est-quality rendition. This is the rendition  that
                            is  delivered to viewers with the fastest internet
                            connections. If you don't specify a value,  Media-
                            Convert uses 8,000,000 (8 mb/s) by default.

                        MaxRenditions -> (integer)
                            Optional.  The  maximum  number of renditions that
                            MediaConvert will create  in  your  automated  ABR
                            stack.  The  number  of  renditions  is determined
                            automatically, based on analysis of each job,  but
                            will never exceed this limit. When you set this to
                            Auto  in  the  console,  which  is  equivalent  to
                            excluding  it  from  your  JSON job specification,
                            MediaConvert defaults to a limit of 15.

                        MinAbrBitrate -> (integer)
                            Optional. The minimum target bitrate used in  your
                            automated ABR stack. Use this value to set a lower
                            limit on the bitrate of video delivered to viewers
                            with slow internet connections. If you don't spec-
                            ify a value, MediaConvert uses 600,000 (600  kb/s)
                            by default.

                 CustomName -> (string)
                     Use  Custom Group Name (CustomName) to specify a name for
                     the output group. This value is displayed on the  console
                     and  can make your job settings JSON more human-readable.
                     It does not affect your outputs. Use up to twelve charac-
                     ters  that are either letters, numbers, spaces, or under-
                     scores.

                 Name -> (string)
                     Name of the output group

                 OutputGroupSettings -> (structure)
                     Output Group settings, including type

                     CmafGroupSettings -> (structure)
                        Settings related to your CMAF output package. For more
                        information,                                       see
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/outputs-file-ABR.html.
                        When you work directly in your JSON job specification,
                        include this object and any required children when you
                        set     Type,     under     OutputGroupSettings,    to
                        CMAF_GROUP_SETTINGS.

                        AdditionalManifests -> (list)
                            By default,  the  service  creates  one  top-level
                            .m3u8  HLS  manifest  and one top -level .mpd DASH
                            manifest for each CMAF output group in  your  job.
                            These  default manifests reference every output in
                            the output group. To create  additional  top-level
                            manifests  that  reference a subset of the outputs
                            in the output group, specify a list of them  here.
                            For each additional manifest that you specify, the
                            service creates one HLS manifest and one DASH man-
                            ifest.

                            (structure)
                               Specify  the  details  for each pair of HLS and
                               DASH additional manifests  that  you  want  the
                               service to generate for this CMAF output group.
                               Each pair of manifests can reference a  differ-
                               ent subset of outputs in the group.

                               ManifestNameModifier -> (string)
                                   Specify  a  name  modifier that the service
                                   adds to the name of this manifest  to  make
                                   it  different  from  the  file names of the
                                   other main manifests in the  output  group.
                                   For example, say that the default main man-
                                   ifest for your HLS group is film-name.m3u8.
                                   If  you  enter  "-no-premium" for this set-
                                   ting, then the file name the service gener-
                                   ates   for   this   top-level  manifest  is
                                   film-name-no-premium.m3u8. For  HLS  output
                                   groups, specify a manifestNameModifier that
                                   is different from the nameModifier  of  the
                                   output.  The  service  uses the output name
                                   modifier to create  unique  names  for  the
                                   individual variant manifests.

                               SelectedOutputs -> (list)
                                   Specify  the  outputs  that  you  want this
                                   additional top-level manifest to reference.

                                   (string)

                        BaseUrl -> (string)
                            A partial URI prefix that will be put in the mani-
                            fest file at the top level BaseURL element. Can be
                            used if streams are delivered from a different URL
                            than the manifest file.

                        ClientCache -> (string)
                            Disable  this  setting  only  when  your  workflow
                            requires the #EXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:no tag. Otherwise,
                            keep the default value Enabled (ENABLED) and  con-
                            trol  caching  in  your video distribution set up.
                            For example, use the Cache-Control http header.

                        CodecSpecification -> (string)
                            Specification to  use  (RFC-6381  or  the  default
                            RFC-4281) during m3u8 playlist generation.

                        Destination -> (string)
                            Use  Destination  (Destination)  to specify the S3
                            output location and the output filename base. Des-
                            tination accepts format identifiers. If you do not
                            specify the base filename in the URI, the  service
                            will  use  the filename of the input file. If your
                            job has multiple  inputs,  the  service  uses  the
                            filename of the first input file.

                        DestinationSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings  associated  with  the  destination. Will
                            vary based on the type of destination

                            S3Settings -> (structure)
                               Settings associated with S3 destination

                               AccessControl -> (structure)
                                   Optional. Have  MediaConvert  automatically
                                   apply Amazon S3 access control for the out-
                                   puts in this output group. When  you  don't
                                   use  this setting, S3 automatically applies
                                   the default access control list PRIVATE.

                                   EncryptionType -> (string)
                                      Specify how you want your data keys man-
                                      aged. AWS uses data keys to encrypt your
                                      content. AWS also encrypts the data keys
                                      themselves, using a customer master  key
                                      (CMK),  and  then  stores  the encrypted
                                      data keys alongside your encrypted  con-
                                      tent.  Use this setting to specify which
                                      AWS service manages the  CMK.  For  sim-
                                      plest   set   up,   choose   Amazon   S3
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_S3). If you want
                                      your master key to be managed by AWS Key
                                      Management Service (KMS), choose AWS KMS
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).         By
                                      default, when you choose  AWS  KMS,  KMS
                                      uses the AWS managed customer master key
                                      (CMK)  associated  with  Amazon  S3   to
                                      encrypt  your data keys. You can option-
                                      ally choose to specify a different, cus-
                                      tomer  managed  CMK. Do so by specifying
                                      the Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                      key for the setting KMS ARN (kmsKeyArn).

                                   KmsEncryptionContext -> (string)
                                      Optionally, specify the encryption  con-
                                      text that you want to use alongside your
                                      KMS key. AWS KMS  uses  this  encryption
                                      context as additional authenticated data
                                      (AAD) to support  authenticated  encryp-
                                      tion.    This    value    must    be   a
                                      base64-encoded UTF-8 string holding JSON
                                      which represents a string-string map. To
                                      use this  setting,  you  must  also  set
                                      Server-side  encryption (S3ServerSideEn-
                                      cryptionType)      to      AWS       KMS
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).  For  more

                                      Optionally,  specify the customer master
                                      key  (CMK)  that  you  want  to  use  to
                                      encrypt  the  data  key that AWS uses to
                                      encrypt your output content.  Enter  the
                                      Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the CMK.
                                      To use this setting, you must  also  set
                                      Server-side  encryption (S3ServerSideEn-
                                      cryptionType)      to      AWS       KMS
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS). If you set
                                      Server-side encryption to  AWS  KMS  but
                                      don't  specify  a CMK here, AWS uses the
                                      AWS managed CMK associated  with  Amazon
                                      S3.

                               service to use when encrypting your  CMAF  seg-
                               ments. Choose AES-CBC subsample (SAMPLE-AES) or
                               AES_CTR (AES-CTR).

                            InitializationVectorInManifest -> (string)
                               When you use  DRM  with  CMAF  outputs,  choose
                               whether  the service writes the 128-bit encryp-
                               tion initialization vector in the HLS and  DASH
                               manifests.

                            SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)
                               If  your  output  group type is CMAF, use these
                               settings  when  doing  DRM  encryption  with  a
                               SPEKE-compliant  key  provider.  If your output
                               group type is HLS, DASH, or  Microsoft  Smooth,
                               use the SpekeKeyProvider settings instead.

                               CertificateArn -> (string)
                                   If  you  want  your key provider to encrypt
                                   the content keys that it provides to Media-
                                   Convert, set up a certificate with a master
                                   key using AWS Certificate Manager.  Specify
                                   the   certificate's  Amazon  Resource  Name
                                   (ARN) here.

                            fragments.  When you don't specify a value, Media-
                            Convert defaults to 2. Related setting: Use  Frag-
                            ment  length  control  (FragmentLengthControl)  to
                            specify whether the encoder  enforces  this  value
                            strictly.

                        ImageBasedTrickPlay -> (string)
                            Specify  whether MediaConvert generates images for
                            trick play. Keep the default value,  None  (NONE),
                            to  not  generate  any  images.  Choose  Thumbnail
                            (THUMBNAIL) to generate tiled  thumbnails.  Choose
                            Thumbnail and full frame (THUMBNAIL_AND_FULLFRAME)
                            to generate tiled thumbnails  and  full-resolution
                            images of single frames. When you enable Write HLS
                            manifest (WriteHlsManifest), MediaConvert  creates
                            a  child  manifest for each set of images that you
                            generate and adds  corresponding  entries  to  the
                            parent  manifest. When you enable Write DASH mani-
                            fest  (WriteDashManifest),  MediaConvert  adds  an
                            entry  in the .mpd manifest for each set of images
                            that you generate. A common application for  these
                            images  is  Roku  trick  mode.  The thumbnails and
                            full-frame images that MediaConvert  creates  with

                               thumbnails. If set to FOLLOW_IFRAME,  MediaCon-
                               vert generates thumbnails for each IDR frame in
                               the output (matching the GOP cadence).  If  set
                               to FOLLOW_CUSTOM, MediaConvert generates thumb-
                               nails according to the interval you specify  in
                               thumbnailInterval.

                            ThumbnailHeight -> (integer)
                               Height  of  each  thumbnail  within  each  tile
                               image,  in  pixels.  Leave  blank  to  maintain
                               aspect ratio with thumbnail width. If following
                               the aspect ratio would lead  to  a  total  tile
                               height  greater than 4096, then the job will be
                               rejected. Must be divisible by 2.

                            ThumbnailInterval -> (double)
                               Enter the interval, in seconds, that  MediaCon-
                               vert uses to generate thumbnails. If the inter-
                               val you enter doesn't  align  with  the  output
                               frame  rate,  MediaConvert automatically rounds
                               the interval to align  with  the  output  frame
                               rate.  For example, if the output frame rate is
                               29.97 frames per second and you enter 5, Media-
                               Convert  uses  a 150 frame interval to generate
                               thumbnails.

                            ThumbnailWidth -> (integer)
                               Width of each thumbnail within each tile image,
                               in pixels. Default is 312. Must be divisible by
                               8.

                            TileHeight -> (integer)
                               Number of thumbnails in each column of  a  tile
                               image.  Set a value between 2 and 2048. Must be
                               divisible by 2.

                            TileWidth -> (integer)
                               Number of thumbnails in  each  row  of  a  tile
                               image. Set a value between 1 and 512.

                        ManifestCompression -> (string)
                            When set to GZIP, compresses HLS playlist.

                        ManifestDurationFormat -> (string)
                            Indicates  whether  the output manifest should use
                            floating point values for segment duration.

                        MinBufferTime -> (integer)
                            Minimum time of initially buffered media  that  is
                            needed to ensure smooth playout.

                        MinFinalSegmentLength -> (double)
                            Keep  this  setting  at  the  default  value of 0,
                            unless you are troubleshooting a problem with  how
                            devices  play back the end of your video asset. If
                            you know that player devices are  hanging  on  the
                            final  segment of your video because the length of
                            your final segment is too short, use this  setting
                            to specify a minimum final segment length, in sec-
                            onds. Choose a value that is greater than or equal
                            to  1  and less than your segment length. When you
                            specify a value for this setting, the encoder will
                            combine any final segment that is shorter than the
                            length that you specify with the previous segment.
                            For  example, your segment length is 3 seconds and
                            your final segment is .5 seconds without a minimum
                            final  segment  length;  when  you set the minimum
                            final segment length to 1, your final  segment  is
                            3.5 seconds.

                        MpdProfile -> (string)
                            Specify  whether your DASH profile is on-demand or
                            main. When you choose Main profile (MAIN_PROFILE),
                            the                 service                signals
                            urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-main:2011 in your .mpd
                            DASH   manifest.   When   you   choose   On-demand
                            (ON_DEMAND_PROFILE),    the    service     signals
                            urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-on-demand:2011 in your
                            .mpd. When you choose On-demand, you must also set
                            the output group setting Segment control (Segment-
                            Control) to Single file (SINGLE_FILE).

                        PtsOffsetHandlingForBFrames -> (string)
                            Use this  setting  only  when  your  output  video
                            stream has B-frames, which causes the initial pre-
                            sentation time stamp (PTS) to be offset  from  the
                            initial decode time stamp (DTS). Specify how Medi-
                            aConvert handles PTS when writing time  stamps  in
                            output  DASH  manifests.  Choose Match initial PTS
                            (MATCH_INITIAL_PTS) when you want MediaConvert  to
                            use the initial PTS as the first time stamp in the
                            manifest. Choose Zero-based (ZERO_BASED)  to  have
                            MediaConvert  ignore  the initial PTS in the video
                            stream and instead write the initial time stamp as
                            zero  in the manifest. For outputs that don't have
                            B-frames, the time stamps in your  DASH  manifests
                            start at zero regardless of your choice here.

                        SegmentControl -> (string)
                            When  set  to SINGLE_FILE, a single output file is
                            generated, which is internally segmented using the
                            Fragment  Length  and  Segment Length. When set to
                            SEGMENTED_FILES, separate segment  files  will  be
                            created.

                        SegmentLength -> (integer)
                            Specify the length, in whole seconds, of each seg-
                            ment. When you don't specify a value, MediaConvert
                            defaults  to  10.  Related  settings:  Use Segment
                            length control (SegmentLengthControl)  to  specify
                            whether  the encoder enforces this value strictly.
                            Use Segment control (CmafSegmentControl) to  spec-
                            ify  whether MediaConvert creates separate segment
                            files or one content file  that  has  metadata  to
                            mark the segment boundaries.

                        SegmentLengthControl -> (string)
                            Specify how you want MediaConvert to determine the
                            segment length. Choose Exact (EXACT) to  have  the
                            encoder use the exact length that you specify with
                            the setting Segment length  (SegmentLength).  This
                            might result in extra I-frames. Choose Multiple of
                            GOP (GOP_MULTIPLE) to have the  encoder  round  up
                            the  segment  lengths to match the next GOP bound-
                            ary.

                        StreamInfResolution -> (string)
                            Include or exclude RESOLUTION attribute for  video
                            in EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag of variant manifest.

                        TargetDurationCompatibilityMode -> (string)
                            When set to LEGACY, the segment target duration is
                            always rounded up to  the  nearest  integer  value
                            above  its  current  value in seconds. When set to
                            SPEC\_COMPLIANT, the segment  target  duration  is
                            rounded  up  to the nearest integer value if frac-
                            tion seconds are greater than or equal to 0.5  (>=
                            0.5) and rounded down if less than 0.5 (<0.5). You
                            may need to use LEGACY if  your  client  needs  to
                            ensure  that  the target duration is always longer
                            than the actual  duration  of  the  segment.  Some
                            older  players may experience interrupted playback
                            when the actual duration of a track in  a  segment
                            is longer than the target duration.

                        WriteDashManifest -> (string)
                            When  set  to ENABLED, a DASH MPD manifest will be
                            generated for this output.

                        WriteHlsManifest -> (string)
                            When set to ENABLED, an Apple HLS manifest will be
                            generated for this output.

                        WriteSegmentTimelineInRepresentation -> (string)
                            When  you  enable Precise segment duration in DASH
                            manifests  (writeSegmentTimelineInRepresentation),
                            your  DASH  manifest  shows  precise segment dura-
                            tions. The segment  duration  information  appears
                            inside  the  SegmentTimeline  element, inside Seg-
                            mentTemplate at  the  Representation  level.  When
                            this  feature isn't enabled, the segment durations
                            in your DASH manifest are approximate. The segment
                            duration   information  appears  in  the  duration
                            attribute of the SegmentTemplate element.

                     DashIsoGroupSettings -> (structure)

                        When you work directly in your JSON job specification,
                        include this object and any required children when you
                        set     Type,     under     OutputGroupSettings,    to

                        AdditionalManifests -> (list)
                            By default, the service creates one .mpd DASH man-
                            ifest  for each DASH ISO output group in your job.
                            This default manifest references every  output  in
                            the  output group. To create additional DASH mani-
                            fests that reference a subset of  the  outputs  in
                            the output group, specify a list of them here.

                            (structure)
                               Specify  the  details  for each additional DASH
                               manifest that you want the service to  generate
                               for this output group. Each manifest can refer-
                               ence a  different  subset  of  outputs  in  the
                               group.

                               ManifestNameModifier -> (string)
                                   Specify  a  name  modifier that the service
                                   adds to the name of this manifest  to  make
                                   it  different  from  the  file names of the
                                   other main manifests in the  output  group.
                                   For example, say that the default main man-
                                   ifest for your DASH group is film-name.mpd.
                                   If  you  enter  "-no-premium" for this set-
                                   ting, then the file name the service gener-
                                   ates   for   this   top-level  manifest  is
                                   film-name-no-premium.mpd.

                               SelectedOutputs -> (list)
                                   Specify the  outputs  that  you  want  this
                                   additional top-level manifest to reference.

                                   (string)

                        AudioChannelConfigSchemeIdUri -> (string)
                            Use this setting only when your audio codec  is  a
                            Dolby  one  (AC3,  EAC3,  or Atmos) and your down-
                            stream workflow requires that your  DASH  manifest
                            use  the  Dolby  channel configuration tag, rather
                            than the MPEG one. For example, you might need  to
                            use  this to make dynamic ad insertion work. Spec-
                            ify which audio channel  configuration  scheme  ID
                            URI  MediaConvert  writes  in  your DASH manifest.
                            Keep the default value, MPEG channel configuration
                            (MPEG_CHANNEL_CONFIGURATION), to have MediaConvert
                            write                                        this:
                            urn:mpeg:mpegB:cicp:ChannelConfiguration.   Choose
                            Dolby channel configuration (DOLBY_CHANNEL_CONFIG-
                            URATION)  to have MediaConvert write this instead:
                            tag:dolby.com,2014:dash:audio_channel_configuration:2011.

                        BaseUrl -> (string)
                            A partial URI prefix that will be put in the mani-
                            fest (.mpd) file at the top level BaseURL element.
                            Can  be  used if streams are delivered from a dif-
                            ferent URL than the manifest file.

                        Destination -> (string)

                            output location and the output filename base. Des-
                            tination accepts format identifiers. If you do not
                            specify  the base filename in the URI, the service
                            will use the filename of the input file.  If  your
                            job  has  multiple  inputs,  the  service uses the
                            filename of the first input file.

                                      aged. AWS uses data keys to encrypt your
                                      content. AWS also encrypts the data keys
                                      themselves,  using a customer master key
                                      (CMK), and  then  stores  the  encrypted
                                      data  keys alongside your encrypted con-
                                      tent. Use this setting to specify  which
                                      AWS  service  manages  the CMK. For sim-
                                      plest   set   up,   choose   Amazon   S3
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_S3). If you want
                                      your master key to be managed by AWS Key
                                      Management Service (KMS), choose AWS KMS
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).         By
                                      default,  when  you  choose AWS KMS, KMS
                                      uses the AWS managed customer master key
                                      (CMK)   associated  with  Amazon  S3  to
                                      encrypt your data keys. You can  option-
                                      ally choose to specify a different, cus-
                                      tomer managed CMK. Do so  by  specifying
                                      the  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the
                                      key for the setting KMS ARN (kmsKeyArn).

                                   KmsEncryptionContext -> (string)
                                      Optionally,  specify the encryption con-
                                      text that you want to use alongside your
                                      KMS  key.  AWS  KMS uses this encryption
                                      context as additional authenticated data
                                      (AAD)  to  support authenticated encryp-
                                      tion.   This    value    must    be    a
                                      base64-encoded UTF-8 string holding JSON
                                      which represents a string-string map. To
                                      use  this  setting,  you  must  also set
                                      Server-side encryption  (S3ServerSideEn-
                                      cryptionType)       to      AWS      KMS

                                   KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                                      Optionally, specify the customer  master
                                      key  (CMK)  that  you  want  to  use  to
                                      encrypt the data key that  AWS  uses  to
                                      encrypt  your  output content. Enter the
                                      Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  CMK.
                                      To  use  this setting, you must also set
                                      Server-side encryption  (S3ServerSideEn-
                                      cryptionType)       to      AWS      KMS
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS). If you set
                                      Server-side  encryption  to  AWS KMS but
                                      don't specify a CMK here, AWS  uses  the
                                      AWS  managed  CMK associated with Amazon
                                      S3.

                               This setting can improve the  compatibility  of
                               your  output  with  video  players  on obsolete

                               (UNENCRYPTED_SEI) only to correct problems with
                               playback  on older devices. Otherwise, keep the
                               default  setting  CENC  v1  (CENC_V1).  If  you
                               choose  Unencrypted  SEI,  for that output, the
                               service will exclude the access unit  delimiter
                               and will leave the SEI NAL units unencrypted.

                            SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)
                               If  your  output  group  type  is HLS, DASH, or
                               Microsoft Smooth, use these settings when doing

                        FragmentLength -> (integer)
                            Length of  fragments  to  generate  (in  seconds).
                            Fragment  length  must be compatible with GOP size
                            and Framerate. Note that fragments will end on the
                            next  keyframe  after  this  number of seconds, so
                            actual fragment length may be  longer.  When  Emit
                            Single  File  is  checked,  the  fragmentation  is
                            internal to a single output file and it  does  not
                            cause  the  creation  of  many  output files as in
                            other output types.

                        ImageBasedTrickPlay -> (string)
                            Specify whether MediaConvert generates images  for
                            trick  play.  Keep the default value, None (NONE),
                            to  not  generate  any  images.  Choose  Thumbnail
                            (THUMBNAIL)  to  generate tiled thumbnails. Choose
                            Thumbnail and full frame (THUMBNAIL_AND_FULLFRAME)
                            to  generate  tiled thumbnails and full-resolution
                            images of  single  frames.  MediaConvert  adds  an
                            entry  in the .mpd manifest for each set of images
                            that you generate. A common application for  these
                            images  is  Roku  trick  mode.  The thumbnails and
                            full-frame images that MediaConvert  creates  with

                            IntervalCadence -> (string)
                               The cadence MediaConvert follows for generating
                               thumbnails. If set to FOLLOW_IFRAME,  MediaCon-
                               vert generates thumbnails for each IDR frame in
                               the output (matching the GOP cadence).  If  set
                               to FOLLOW_CUSTOM, MediaConvert generates thumb-
                               nails according to the interval you specify  in
                               thumbnailInterval.

                            ThumbnailHeight -> (integer)
                               Height  of  each  thumbnail  within  each  tile
                               image,  in  pixels.  Leave  blank  to  maintain
                               aspect ratio with thumbnail width. If following
                               the aspect ratio would lead  to  a  total  tile
                               height  greater than 4096, then the job will be
                               rejected. Must be divisible by 2.

                            ThumbnailInterval -> (double)
                               Enter the interval, in seconds, that  MediaCon-
                               vert uses to generate thumbnails. If the inter-
                               val you enter doesn't  align  with  the  output
                               frame  rate,  MediaConvert automatically rounds
                               the interval to align  with  the  output  frame
                               rate.  For example, if the output frame rate is
                               29.97 frames per second and you enter 5, Media-
                               Convert  uses  a 150 frame interval to generate
                               thumbnails.

                            ThumbnailWidth -> (integer)
                               Width of each thumbnail within each tile image,
                               in pixels. Default is 312. Must be divisible by
                               8.

                            TileHeight -> (integer)
                               Number of thumbnails in each column of  a  tile
                               image.  Set a value between 2 and 2048. Must be
                               divisible by 2.

                            TileWidth -> (integer)
                               Number of thumbnails in  each  row  of  a  tile
                               image. Set a value between 1 and 512.

                        MinBufferTime -> (integer)
                            Minimum  time  of initially buffered media that is
                            needed to ensure smooth playout.

                        MinFinalSegmentLength -> (double)
                            Keep this setting  at  the  default  value  of  0,
                            unless  you are troubleshooting a problem with how
                            devices play back the end of your video asset.  If
                            you  know  that  player devices are hanging on the
                            final segment of your video because the length  of
                            your  final segment is too short, use this setting
                            to specify a minimum final segment length, in sec-
                            onds. Choose a value that is greater than or equal
                            to 1 and less than your segment length.  When  you
                            specify a value for this setting, the encoder will
                            combine any final segment that is shorter than the
                            length that you specify with the previous segment.
                            For example, your segment length is 3 seconds  and
                            your final segment is .5 seconds without a minimum
                            final segment length; when  you  set  the  minimum
                            final  segment  length to 1, your final segment is
                            3.5 seconds.

                        MpdProfile -> (string)
                            Specify whether your DASH profile is on-demand  or
                            main. When you choose Main profile (MAIN_PROFILE),
                            the                service                 signals
                            urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-main:2011 in your .mpd
                            DASH   manifest.   When   you   choose   On-demand
                            (ON_DEMAND_PROFILE),     the    service    signals
                            urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-on-demand:2011 in your
                            .mpd. When you choose On-demand, you must also set
                            the output group setting Segment control (Segment-
                            Control) to Single file (SINGLE_FILE).

                        PtsOffsetHandlingForBFrames -> (string)
                            Use  this  setting  only  when  your  output video
                            stream has B-frames, which causes the initial pre-
                            sentation  time  stamp (PTS) to be offset from the
                            initial decode time stamp (DTS). Specify how Medi-
                            aConvert  handles  PTS when writing time stamps in
                            output DASH manifests. Choose  Match  initial  PTS
                            (MATCH_INITIAL_PTS)  when you want MediaConvert to
                            use the initial PTS as the first time stamp in the
                            manifest.  Choose  Zero-based (ZERO_BASED) to have
                            MediaConvert ignore the initial PTS in  the  video
                            stream and instead write the initial time stamp as
                            zero in the manifest. For outputs that don't  have
                            B-frames,  the  time stamps in your DASH manifests
                            start at zero regardless of your choice here.

                        SegmentControl -> (string)
                            When set to SINGLE_FILE, a single output  file  is
                            generated, which is internally segmented using the
                            Fragment Length and Segment Length.  When  set  to
                            SEGMENTED_FILES,  separate  segment  files will be
                            created.

                        SegmentLength -> (integer)
                            Specify the length, in whole seconds, of each seg-
                            ment. When you don't specify a value, MediaConvert
                            defaults to  30.  Related  settings:  Use  Segment
                            length  control  (SegmentLengthControl) to specify
                            whether the encoder enforces this value  strictly.
                            Use  Segment  control  (DashIsoSegmentControl)  to
                            specify whether MediaConvert creates separate seg-
                            ment  files  or one content file that has metadata
                            to mark the segment boundaries.

                        SegmentLengthControl -> (string)
                            Specify how you want MediaConvert to determine the
                            segment  length.  Choose Exact (EXACT) to have the
                            encoder use the exact length that you specify with
                            the  setting  Segment length (SegmentLength). This
                            might result in extra I-frames. Choose Multiple of
                            GOP  (GOP_MULTIPLE)  to  have the encoder round up
                            the segment lengths to match the next  GOP  bound-
                            ary.

                        WriteSegmentTimelineInRepresentation -> (string)
                            If you get an HTTP error in the 400 range when you
                            play back your DASH output,  enable  this  setting
                            and  run  your  transcoding  job  again.  When you
                            enable this setting, the  service  writes  precise
                            segment  durations  in the DASH manifest. The seg-
                            ment duration information appears inside the  Seg-
                            mentTimeline  element,  inside  SegmentTemplate at
                            the Representation level. When  you  don't  enable
                            this  setting, the service writes approximate seg-
                            ment durations in your DASH manifest.

                     FileGroupSettings -> (structure)
                        Settings related to your File output group.  MediaCon-
                        vert  uses this group of settings to generate a single
                        standalone file, rather than a streaming package. When
                        you  work  directly  in  your  JSON job specification,
                        include this object and any required children when you
                        set     Type,     under     OutputGroupSettings,    to
                        FILE_GROUP_SETTINGS.

                        Destination -> (string)
                            Use Destination (Destination) to  specify  the  S3
                            output location and the output filename base. Des-
                            tination accepts format identifiers. If you do not
                            specify  the base filename in the URI, the service
                            will use the filename of the input file.  If  your
                            job  has  multiple  inputs,  the  service uses the
                            filename of the first input file.

                        DestinationSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings associated  with  the  destination.  Will
                            vary based on the type of destination

                            S3Settings -> (structure)
                               Settings associated with S3 destination

                               AccessControl -> (structure)
                                   Optional.  Have  MediaConvert automatically
                                   apply Amazon S3 access control for the out-
                                   puts  in  this output group. When you don't
                                   use this setting, S3 automatically  applies
                                   the default access control list PRIVATE.

                                   CannedAcl -> (string)
                                      Choose an Amazon S3 canned ACL for Medi-
                                      aConvert to apply to this output.

                               Encryption -> (structure)
                                   Settings  for  how  your  job  outputs  are
                                   encrypted  as  they  are uploaded to Amazon
                                   S3.

                                   EncryptionType -> (string)
                                      Specify how you want your data keys man-
                                      aged. AWS uses data keys to encrypt your
                                      content. AWS also encrypts the data keys
                                      themselves,  using a customer master key
                                      (CMK), and  then  stores  the  encrypted
                                      data  keys alongside your encrypted con-
                                      tent. Use this setting to specify  which
                                      AWS  service  manages  the CMK. For sim-
                                      plest   set   up,   choose   Amazon   S3
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_S3). If you want
                                      your master key to be managed by AWS Key
                                      Management Service (KMS), choose AWS KMS
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).         By
                                      default,  when  you  choose AWS KMS, KMS
                                      uses the AWS managed customer master key
                                      (CMK)   associated  with  Amazon  S3  to
                                      encrypt your data keys. You can  option-
                                      ally choose to specify a different, cus-
                                      tomer managed CMK. Do so  by  specifying
                                      the  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the
                                      key for the setting KMS ARN (kmsKeyArn).

                                   KmsEncryptionContext -> (string)
                                      Optionally,  specify the encryption con-
                                      text that you want to use alongside your
                                      KMS  key.  AWS  KMS uses this encryption
                                      context as additional authenticated data
                                      (AAD)  to  support authenticated encryp-
                                      tion.   This    value    must    be    a
                                      base64-encoded UTF-8 string holding JSON
                                      which represents a string-string map. To
                                      use  this  setting,  you  must  also set
                                      Server-side encryption  (S3ServerSideEn-
                                      cryptionType)       to      AWS      KMS
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).  For  more

                                   KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                                      Optionally, specify the customer  master
                                      key  (CMK)  that  you  want  to  use  to
                                      encrypt the data key that  AWS  uses  to
                                      encrypt  your  output content. Enter the
                                      Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  CMK.
                                      To  use  this setting, you must also set
                                      Server-side encryption  (S3ServerSideEn-
                                      cryptionType)       to      AWS      KMS
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS). If you set
                                      Server-side  encryption  to  AWS KMS but
                                      don't specify a CMK here, AWS  uses  the
                                      AWS  managed  CMK associated with Amazon
                                      S3.

                     HlsGroupSettings -> (structure)
                        Settings related to your HLS output package. For  more
                        information,                                       see

                        When you work directly in your JSON job specification,
                        include this object and any required children when you
                        set Type, under OutputGroupSettings, to HLS_GROUP_SET-
                        TINGS.

                        AdMarkers -> (list)
                            Choose one or more ad  marker  types  to  decorate
                            your  Apple  HLS  manifest.  This setting does not
                            determine whether SCTE-35 markers  appear  in  the
                            outputs themselves.

                            (string)

                        AdditionalManifests -> (list)
                            By  default,  the  service  creates  one top-level
                            .m3u8 HLS manifest for each HLS  output  group  in
                            your  job.  This default manifest references every
                            output in the output group. To  create  additional
                            top-level manifests that reference a subset of the
                            outputs in the output group,  specify  a  list  of
                            them here.

                            (structure)
                               Specify  the  details  for  each additional HLS
                               manifest that you want the service to  generate
                               for this output group. Each manifest can refer-
                               ence a  different  subset  of  outputs  in  the
                               group.

                               ManifestNameModifier -> (string)
                                   Specify  a  name  modifier that the service
                                   adds to the name of this manifest  to  make
                                   it  different  from  the  file names of the
                                   other main manifests in the  output  group.
                                   For example, say that the default main man-
                                   ifest for your HLS group is film-name.m3u8.
                                   If  you  enter  "-no-premium" for this set-
                                   ting, then the file name the service gener-
                                   ates   for   this   top-level  manifest  is
                                   film-name-no-premium.m3u8. For  HLS  output
                                   groups, specify a manifestNameModifier that
                                   is different from the nameModifier  of  the
                                   output.  The  service  uses the output name
                                   modifier to create  unique  names  for  the
                                   individual variant manifests.

                               SelectedOutputs -> (list)
                                   Specify  the  outputs  that  you  want this
                                   additional top-level manifest to reference.

                                   (string)

                        AudioOnlyHeader -> (string)
                            Ignore  this setting unless you are using FairPlay
                            DRM with Verimatrix  and  you  encounter  playback
                            issues. Keep the default value, Include (INCLUDE),
                            to  output  audio-only  headers.  Choose   Exclude
                            (EXCLUDE)  to  remove  the audio-only headers from
                            your audio segments.

                        BaseUrl -> (string)
                            A partial URI prefix that  will  be  prepended  to
                            each  output  in the media .m3u8 file. Can be used
                            if base manifest is delivered from a different URL
                            than the main .m3u8 file.

                        CaptionLanguageMappings -> (list)
                            Language to be used on Caption outputs

                            (structure)

                               CaptionChannel -> (integer)
                                   Caption channel.

                               CustomLanguageCode -> (string)
                                   Specify  the  language  for  this  captions
                                   channel, using the ISO 639-2 or  ISO  639-3

                               LanguageCode -> (string)
                                   Specify  the  language, using the ISO 639-2
                                   three-letter      code      listed       at

                               LanguageDescription -> (string)
                                   Caption language description.

                        CaptionLanguageSetting -> (string)
                            Applies only  to  608  Embedded  output  captions.
                            Insert: Include CLOSED-CAPTIONS lines in the mani-
                            fest. Specify at least one  language  in  the  CC1
                            Language  Code  field.  One CLOSED-CAPTION line is
                            added for each Language  Code  you  specify.  Make
                            sure  to  specify  the  languages  in the order in
                            which they appear in the original source  (if  the
                            source  is  embedded  format)  or the order of the
                            caption selectors (if the  source  is  other  than
                            embedded).  Otherwise,  languages  in the manifest
                            will not match up properly with  the  output  cap-
                            tions.  None: Include CLOSED-CAPTIONS=NONE line in
                            the manifest. Omit: Omit any CLOSED-CAPTIONS  line
                            from the manifest.

                        ClientCache -> (string)
                            Disable  this  setting  only  when  your  workflow
                            requires the #EXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:no tag. Otherwise,
                            keep  the default value Enabled (ENABLED) and con-
                            trol caching in your video  distribution  set  up.
                            For example, use the Cache-Control http header.

                        CodecSpecification -> (string)
                            Specification  to  use  (RFC-6381  or  the default
                            RFC-4281) during m3u8 playlist generation.

                        Destination -> (string)
                            Use Destination (Destination) to  specify  the  S3
                            output location and the output filename base. Des-
                            tination accepts format identifiers. If you do not
                            specify  the base filename in the URI, the service
                            will use the filename of the input file.  If  your
                            job  has  multiple  inputs,  the  service uses the
                            filename of the first input file.

                        DestinationSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings associated  with  the  destination.  Will
                            vary based on the type of destination

                            S3Settings -> (structure)
                               Settings associated with S3 destination

                               AccessControl -> (structure)
                                   Optional.  Have  MediaConvert automatically
                                   apply Amazon S3 access control for the out-
                                   puts  in  this output group. When you don't
                                   use this setting, S3 automatically  applies
                                   the default access control list PRIVATE.

                                   CannedAcl -> (string)
                                      Choose an Amazon S3 canned ACL for Medi-
                                      aConvert to apply to this output.

                               Encryption -> (structure)
                                   Settings  for  how  your  job  outputs  are
                                   encrypted  as  they  are uploaded to Amazon
                                   S3.

                                   EncryptionType -> (string)
                                      Specify how you want your data keys man-
                                      aged. AWS uses data keys to encrypt your
                                      content. AWS also encrypts the data keys
                                      themselves,  using a customer master key
                                      (CMK), and  then  stores  the  encrypted
                                      data  keys alongside your encrypted con-
                                      tent. Use this setting to specify  which
                                      AWS  service  manages  the CMK. For sim-
                                      plest   set   up,   choose   Amazon   S3
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_S3). If you want
                                      your master key to be managed by AWS Key
                                      Management Service (KMS), choose AWS KMS
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).         By
                                      default,  when  you  choose AWS KMS, KMS
                                      uses the AWS managed customer master key
                                      (CMK)   associated  with  Amazon  S3  to
                                      encrypt your data keys. You can  option-
                                      ally choose to specify a different, cus-
                                      tomer managed CMK. Do so  by  specifying
                                      the  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the
                                      key for the setting KMS ARN (kmsKeyArn).

                                   KmsEncryptionContext -> (string)
                                      Optionally,  specify the encryption con-
                                      text that you want to use alongside your
                                      KMS  key.  AWS  KMS uses this encryption
                                      context as additional authenticated data
                                      (AAD)  to  support authenticated encryp-
                                      tion.   This    value    must    be    a
                                      base64-encoded UTF-8 string holding JSON
                                      which represents a string-string map. To
                                      use  this  setting,  you  must  also set
                                      Server-side encryption  (S3ServerSideEn-
                                      cryptionType)       to      AWS      KMS
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).  For  more
                                      information  about  encryption  context,
                                      see:

                                   KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                                      Optionally, specify the customer  master
                                      key  (CMK)  that  you  want  to  use  to
                                      encrypt the data key that  AWS  uses  to
                                      encrypt  your  output content. Enter the
                                      Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  CMK.
                                      To  use  this setting, you must also set
                                      Server-side encryption  (S3ServerSideEn-
                                      cryptionType)       to      AWS      KMS
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS). If you set
                                      Server-side  encryption  to  AWS KMS but
                                      don't specify a CMK here, AWS  uses  the
                                      AWS  managed  CMK associated with Amazon
                                      S3.

                        DirectoryStructure -> (string)
                            Indicates whether segments  should  be  placed  in
                            subdirectories.

                        Encryption -> (structure)
                            DRM settings.

                            ConstantInitializationVector -> (string)
                               This  is  a  128-bit,  16-byte hex value repre-
                               sented by a 32-character text string.  If  this
                               parameter  is  not  set then the Initialization
                               Vector  will  follow  the  segment  number   by
                               default.

                            EncryptionMethod -> (string)
                               Encrypts the segments with the given encryption
                               scheme. Leave blank to disable. Selecting 'Dis-
                               abled'  in  the  web  interface  also  disables
                               encryption.

                            InitializationVectorInManifest -> (string)
                               The Initialization Vector is a  128-bit  number
                               used in conjunction with the key for encrypting
                               blocks. If set to INCLUDE, Initialization  Vec-
                               tor  is  listed in the manifest. Otherwise Ini-
                               tialization Vector is not in the manifest.

                            OfflineEncrypted -> (string)

                            IntervalCadence -> (string)
                               The cadence MediaConvert follows for generating
                               thumbnails. If set to FOLLOW_IFRAME,  MediaCon-
                               vert generates thumbnails for each IDR frame in
                               the output (matching the GOP cadence).  If  set
                               to FOLLOW_CUSTOM, MediaConvert generates thumb-
                               nails according to the interval you specify  in
                               thumbnailInterval.

                            ThumbnailHeight -> (integer)
                               Height  of  each  thumbnail  within  each  tile
                               image,  in  pixels.  Leave  blank  to  maintain
                               aspect ratio with thumbnail width. If following
                               the aspect ratio would lead  to  a  total  tile
                               height  greater than 4096, then the job will be
                               rejected. Must be divisible by 2.

                            ThumbnailInterval -> (double)
                               Enter the interval, in seconds, that  MediaCon-
                               vert uses to generate thumbnails. If the inter-
                               val you enter doesn't  align  with  the  output
                               frame  rate,  MediaConvert automatically rounds
                               the interval to align  with  the  output  frame
                               rate.  For example, if the output frame rate is
                               29.97 frames per second and you enter 5, Media-
                               Convert  uses  a 150 frame interval to generate
                               thumbnails.

                            ThumbnailWidth -> (integer)
                               Width of each thumbnail within each tile image,
                               in pixels. Default is 312. Must be divisible by
                               8.

                            TileHeight -> (integer)
                               Number of thumbnails in each column of  a  tile
                               image.  Set a value between 2 and 2048. Must be
                               divisible by 2.

                            TileWidth -> (integer)
                               Number of thumbnails in  each  row  of  a  tile
                               image. Set a value between 1 and 512.

                        ManifestCompression -> (string)
                            When set to GZIP, compresses HLS playlist.

                        ManifestDurationFormat -> (string)
                            Indicates  whether  the output manifest should use
                            floating point values for segment duration.

                        MinFinalSegmentLength -> (double)
                            Keep this setting  at  the  default  value  of  0,
                            unless  you are troubleshooting a problem with how
                            devices play back the end of your video asset.  If
                            you  know  that  player devices are hanging on the
                            final segment of your video because the length  of
                            your  final segment is too short, use this setting
                            to specify a minimum final segment length, in sec-
                            onds. Choose a value that is greater than or equal
                            to 1 and less than your segment length.  When  you
                            specify a value for this setting, the encoder will
                            combine any final segment that is shorter than the
                            length that you specify with the previous segment.
                            For example, your segment length is 3 seconds  and
                            your final segment is .5 seconds without a minimum
                            final segment length; when  you  set  the  minimum
                            final  segment  length to 1, your final segment is
                            3.5 seconds.

                        MinSegmentLength -> (integer)
                            When set, Minimum  Segment  Size  is  enforced  by
                            looking  ahead and back within the specified range
                            for a nearby avail and extending the segment  size
                            if needed.

                        OutputSelection -> (string)
                            Indicates  whether  the .m3u8 manifest file should
                            be generated for this HLS output group.

                        ProgramDateTime -> (string)
                            Includes or excludes  EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME  tag
                            in  .m3u8  manifest files. The value is calculated
                            as follows: either the program date and  time  are
                            initialized  using  the  input timecode source, or
                            the time is initialized using the  input  timecode
                            source and the date is initialized using the time-
                            stamp_offset.

                        ProgramDateTimePeriod -> (integer)
                            Period  of  insertion  of  EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME
                            entry, in seconds.

                        SegmentControl -> (string)
                            When set to SINGLE_FILE, emits program as a single
                            media resource (.ts) file,  uses  #EXT-X-BYTERANGE
                            tags to index segment for playback.

                        SegmentLength -> (integer)
                            Specify the length, in whole seconds, of each seg-
                            ment. When you don't specify a value, MediaConvert
                            defaults  to  10.  Related  settings:  Use Segment
                            length control (SegmentLengthControl)  to  specify
                            whether  the encoder enforces this value strictly.
                            Use Segment control (HlsSegmentControl) to specify
                            whether   MediaConvert  creates  separate  segment
                            files or one content file  that  has  metadata  to
                            mark the segment boundaries.

                        SegmentLengthControl -> (string)
                            Specify how you want MediaConvert to determine the
                            segment length. Choose Exact (EXACT) to  have  the
                            encoder use the exact length that you specify with
                            the setting Segment length  (SegmentLength).  This
                            might result in extra I-frames. Choose Multiple of
                            GOP (GOP_MULTIPLE) to have the  encoder  round  up
                            the  segment  lengths to match the next GOP bound-
                            ary.

                        SegmentsPerSubdirectory -> (integer)
                            Number of segments  to  write  to  a  subdirectory
                            before starting a new one. directoryStructure must
                            be SINGLE_DIRECTORY for this setting  to  have  an
                            effect.

                        StreamInfResolution -> (string)
                            Include  or exclude RESOLUTION attribute for video
                            in EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag of variant manifest.

                        TargetDurationCompatibilityMode -> (string)
                            When set to LEGACY, the segment target duration is
                            always  rounded  up  to  the nearest integer value
                            above its current value in seconds.  When  set  to
                            SPEC\_COMPLIANT,  the  segment  target duration is
                            rounded up to the nearest integer value  if  frac-
                            tion  seconds are greater than or equal to 0.5 (>=
                            0.5) and rounded down if less than 0.5 (<0.5). You
                            may  need  to  use  LEGACY if your client needs to
                            ensure that the target duration is  always  longer
                            than  the  actual  duration  of  the segment. Some
                            older players may experience interrupted  playback
                            when  the  actual duration of a track in a segment
                            is longer than the target duration.

                        TimedMetadataId3Frame -> (string)
                            Indicates ID3 frame that has the timecode.

                        TimedMetadataId3Period -> (integer)
                            Timed Metadata interval in seconds.

                        TimestampDeltaMilliseconds -> (integer)
                            Provides an extra millisecond delta offset to fine
                            tune the timestamps.

                     MsSmoothGroupSettings -> (structure)
                        Settings  related  to  your Microsoft Smooth Streaming

                        When you work directly in your JSON job specification,
                        include this object and any required children when you
                        set    Type,     under     OutputGroupSettings,     to
                        MS_SMOOTH_GROUP_SETTINGS.

                        AdditionalManifests -> (list)
                            By default, the service creates one .ism Microsoft
                            Smooth  Streaming  manifest  for  each   Microsoft
                            Smooth  Streaming  output  group in your job. This
                            default manifest references every  output  in  the
                            output  group. To create additional manifests that
                            reference a subset of the outputs  in  the  output
                            group, specify a list of them here.

                            (structure)
                               Specify   the   details   for  each  additional
                               Microsoft Smooth Streaming  manifest  that  you
                               want  the  service  to generate for this output
                               group. Each manifest can reference a  different
                               subset of outputs in the group.

                               ManifestNameModifier -> (string)
                                   Specify  a  name  modifier that the service
                                   adds to the name of this manifest  to  make
                                   it  different  from  the  file names of the
                                   other main manifests in the  output  group.
                                   For example, say that the default main man-
                                   ifest for your Microsoft  Smooth  group  is
                                   film-name.ismv.  If you enter "-no-premium"
                                   for this setting, then the  file  name  the
                                   service  generates for this top-level mani-
                                   fest is film-name-no-premium.ismv.

                               SelectedOutputs -> (list)
                                   Specify the  outputs  that  you  want  this
                                   additional top-level manifest to reference.

                                   (string)

                        AudioDeduplication -> (string)
                            COMBINE_DUPLICATE_STREAMS combines identical audio
                            encoding settings across a Microsoft Smooth output
                            group into a single audio stream.

                        Destination -> (string)
                            Use Destination (Destination) to  specify  the  S3
                            output location and the output filename base. Des-
                            tination accepts format identifiers. If you do not
                            specify  the base filename in the URI, the service
                            will use the filename of the input file.  If  your
                            job  has  multiple  inputs,  the  service uses the
                            filename of the first input file.

                        DestinationSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings associated  with  the  destination.  Will
                            vary based on the type of destination

                            S3Settings -> (structure)
                               Settings associated with S3 destination

                               AccessControl -> (structure)
                                   Optional.  Have  MediaConvert automatically
                                   apply Amazon S3 access control for the out-
                                   puts  in  this output group. When you don't
                                   use this setting, S3 automatically  applies
                                   the default access control list PRIVATE.

                                   CannedAcl -> (string)
                                      Choose an Amazon S3 canned ACL for Medi-
                                      aConvert to apply to this output.

                               Encryption -> (structure)
                                   Settings  for  how  your  job  outputs  are
                                   encrypted  as  they  are uploaded to Amazon
                                   S3.

                                   EncryptionType -> (string)
                                      Specify how you want your data keys man-
                                      aged. AWS uses data keys to encrypt your
                                      content. AWS also encrypts the data keys
                                      themselves,  using a customer master key
                                      (CMK), and  then  stores  the  encrypted
                                      data  keys alongside your encrypted con-
                                      tent. Use this setting to specify  which
                                      AWS  service  manages  the CMK. For sim-
                                      plest   set   up,   choose   Amazon   S3
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_S3). If you want
                                      your master key to be managed by AWS Key
                                      Management Service (KMS), choose AWS KMS
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).         By
                                      default,  when  you  choose AWS KMS, KMS
                                      uses the AWS managed customer master key
                                      (CMK)   associated  with  Amazon  S3  to
                                      encrypt your data keys. You can  option-
                                      ally choose to specify a different, cus-
                                      tomer managed CMK. Do so  by  specifying
                                      the  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the
                                      key for the setting KMS ARN (kmsKeyArn).

                                   KmsEncryptionContext -> (string)
                                      Optionally,  specify the encryption con-
                                      text that you want to use alongside your
                                      KMS  key.  AWS  KMS uses this encryption
                                      context as additional authenticated data
                                      (AAD)  to  support authenticated encryp-
                                      tion.   This    value    must    be    a
                                      base64-encoded UTF-8 string holding JSON
                                      which represents a string-string map. To
                                      use  this  setting,  you  must  also set
                                      Server-side encryption  (S3ServerSideEn-
                                      cryptionType)       to      AWS      KMS
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).  For  more
                                      information  about  encryption  context,
                                      see:

                                   KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                                      Optionally, specify the customer  master
                                      key  (CMK)  that  you  want  to  use  to
                                      encrypt the data key that  AWS  uses  to
                                      encrypt  your  output content. Enter the
                                      Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  CMK.
                                      To  use  this setting, you must also set
                                      Server-side encryption  (S3ServerSideEn-
                                      cryptionType)       to      AWS      KMS
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS). If you set
                                      Server-side  encryption  to  AWS KMS but
                                      don't specify a CMK here, AWS  uses  the
                                      AWS  managed  CMK associated with Amazon
                                      S3.

                        Encryption -> (structure)
                            If you are using DRM, set DRM System  (MsSmoothEn-

                            SpekeKeyProvider.

                            SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)
                               If your output group  type  is  HLS,  DASH,  or
                               Microsoft Smooth, use these settings when doing
                               DRM  encryption  with  a  SPEKE-compliant   key
                               provider.  If  your  output group type is CMAF,
                               use the SpekeKeyProviderCmaf settings  instead.

                               CertificateArn -> (string)
                                   If  you  want  your key provider to encrypt
                                   the content keys that it provides to Media-
                                   Convert, set up a certificate with a master
                                   key using AWS Certificate Manager.  Specify
                                   the   certificate's  Amazon  Resource  Name
                                   (ARN) here.

                               ResourceId -> (string)
                                   Specify   the   resource   ID   that   your
                                   SPEKE-compliant  key provider uses to iden-
                                   tify this content.

                               SystemIds -> (list)
                                   Relates to SPEKE implementation. DRM system
                                   identifiers.  DASH  output groups support a
                                   max of two system ids.  Other  group  types
                                   support      one     system     id.     See

                               Url -> (string)
                                   Specify the URL to the key server that your
                                   SPEKE-compliant DRM key  provider  uses  to
                                   provide keys for encrypting your content.

                        FragmentLength -> (integer)
                            Specify how you want MediaConvert to determine the
                            fragment length. Choose Exact (EXACT) to have  the
                            encoder use the exact length that you specify with
                            the setting Fragment length (FragmentLength). This
                            might result in extra I-frames. Choose Multiple of
                            GOP (GOP_MULTIPLE) to have the  encoder  round  up
                            the  segment  lengths to match the next GOP bound-
                            ary.

                        FragmentLengthControl -> (string)
                            Specify how you want MediaConvert to determine the
                            fragment  length. Choose Exact (EXACT) to have the

                     Type -> (string)
                        Type of output group (File group, Apple HLS, DASH ISO,
                        Microsoft Smooth Streaming, CMAF)

                 Outputs -> (list)
                     This  object holds groups of encoding settings, one group
                     of settings per output.

                     (structure)
                        Each output in your job is a  collection  of  settings
                        that  describes  how you want MediaConvert to encode a
                        single output file or stream.  For  more  information,
                        see
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/create-outputs.html.

                        AudioDescriptions -> (list)
                            (AudioDescriptions)   contains   groups  of  audio
                            encoding  settings  organized  by   audio   codec.
                            Include  one  instance  of (AudioDescriptions) per
                            output. (AudioDescriptions) can  contain  multiple
                            groups of encoding settings.

                            (structure)
                               Settings related to one audio tab on the Media-
                               Convert console. In your job JSON, an  instance
                               of  AudioDescription is equivalent to one audio
                               tab in the console. Usually, one audio tab cor-
                               responds  to  one output audio track. Depending
                               on how you set up your  input  audio  selectors
                               and  whether you use audio selector groups, one
                               audio tab can correspond to a group  of  output
                               audio tracks.

                               AudioChannelTaggingSettings -> (structure)
                                   When you mimic a multi-channel audio layout
                                   with multiple mono-channel tracks, you  can
                                   tag each channel layout manually. For exam-
                                   ple, you would tag the tracks that  contain
                                   your  left,  right,  and  center audio with
                                   Left  (L),  Right  (R),  and  Center   (C),
                                   respectively.  When  you  don't  specify  a
                                   value, MediaConvert labels  your  track  as
                                   Center  (C) by default. To use audio layout
                                   tagging, your output must be in a QuickTime
                                   (.mov)  container; your audio codec must be
                                   AAC, WAV, or AIFF; and you must set up your
                                   audio track to have only one channel.

                                   ChannelTag -> (string)
                                      You  can add a tag for this mono-channel
                                      audio track to mimic its placement in  a
                                      multi-channel  layout.  For  example, if
                                      this track is the left surround channel,
                                      choose Left surround (LS).

                               AudioNormalizationSettings -> (structure)
                                   Advanced   audio   normalization  settings.
                                   Ignore these settings unless  you  need  to
                                   comply with a loudness standard.

                                   AlgorithmControl -> (string)
                                      When  enabled  the  output audio is cor-
                                      rected using the  chosen  algorithm.  If
                                      disabled, the audio will be measured but
                                      not adjusted.

                                   CorrectionGateLevel -> (integer)
                                      Content measuring above this level  will
                                      be  corrected  to the target level. Con-
                                      tent measuring below this level will not
                                      be corrected.

                                      track loudness to a CSV file.

                                   PeakCalculation -> (string)
                                      If set to TRUE_PEAK, calculate  and  log
                                      the  TruePeak  for  each  output's audio

                                   TargetLkfs -> (double)
                                      When   you   use   Audio   normalization
                                      (AudioNormalizationSettings), optionally
                                      use this setting  to  specify  a  target
                                      loudness.  If  you don't specify a value
                                      here, the encoder chooses  a  value  for
                                      you,  based  on  the  algorithm that you
                                      choose for Algorithm (algorithm). If you
                                      choose  algorithm  1770-1,  the  encoder
                                      will choose  -24  LKFS;  otherwise,  the
                                      encoder will choose -23 LKFS.

                               AudioSourceName -> (string)
                                   Specifies which audio data to use from each
                                   input. In the  simplest  case,  specify  an
                                   "Audio  Selector":#inputs-audio_selector by
                                   name based on its order within each  input.
                                   For  example if you specify "Audio Selector
                                   3", then the third audio selector  will  be
                                   used  from each input. If an input does not
                                   have an "Audio Selector 3", then the  audio
                                   selector  marked as "default" in that input
                                   will be used. If there is no audio selector
                                   marked   as   "default",  silence  will  be
                                   inserted for the duration  of  that  input.
                                   Alternatively,     an    "Audio    Selector
                                   Group":#inputs-audio_selector_group    name
                                   may     be    specified,    with    similar
                                   default/silence     behavior.     If     no
                                   audio_source_name is specified, then "Audio
                                   Selector 1" will be chosen automatically.

                               AudioType -> (integer)
                                   Applies only if Follow Input Audio Type  is
                                   unchecked  (false).  A number between 0 and

                               AudioTypeControl -> (string)
                                   When set to FOLLOW_INPUT, if the input con-
                                   tains an  ISO  639  audio_type,  then  that
                                   value  is  passed through to the output. If
                                   the input contains no ISO  639  audio_type,
                                   the  value in Audio Type is included in the
                                   output. Otherwise the value in  Audio  Type
                                   is  included  in the output. Note that this
                                   field and audioType  are  both  ignored  if
                                   audioDescriptionBroadcasterMix  is  set  to

                               CodecSettings -> (structure)
                                   Settings related  to  audio  encoding.  The
                                   settings  in  this  group vary depending on
                                   the value that you choose  for  your  audio
                                   codec.

                                   AacSettings -> (structure)
                                      Required  when  you  set  (Codec)  under

                                      settings--VBR  and CBR. To select one of
                                      these modes, set the  value  of  Bitrate
                                      control  mode (rateControlMode) to "VBR"
                                      or "CBR". In VBR mode, you  control  the
                                      audio quality with the setting VBR qual-
                                      ity (vbrQuality). In CBR mode,  you  use
                                      the  setting Bitrate (bitrate). Defaults
                                      and valid values depend on the rate con-
                                      trol mode.

                                   Specify  the language for this audio output
                                   track. The service puts this language  code
                                   into  your  output audio track when you set
                                   Language code  control  (AudioLanguageCode-
                                   Control)  to  Use  configured  (USE_CONFIG-
                                   URED). The service also uses your specified
                                   custom  language code when you set Language
                                   code control (AudioLanguageCodeControl)  to
                                   Follow input (FOLLOW_INPUT), but your input
                                   file doesn't specify a language  code.  For
                                   all  outputs,  you  can use an ISO 639-2 or
                                   ISO 639-3 code. For streaming outputs,  you
                                   can  also  use  any  other code in the full
                                   RFC-5646 specification.  Streaming  outputs
                                   are  those that are in one of the following
                                   output groups: CMAF, DASH ISO,  Apple  HLS,
                                   or Microsoft Smooth Streaming.

                               LanguageCode -> (string)
                                   Indicates  the language of the audio output
                                   track. The ISO 639  language  specified  in
                                   the  'Language Code' drop down will be used
                                   when 'Follow Input Language  Code'  is  not
                                   selected  or  when  'Follow  Input Language
                                   Code' is selected but there is no  ISO  639
                                   language code specified by the input.

                               LanguageCodeControl -> (string)
                                   Specify  which  source  for  language  code
                                   takes precedence for this audio track. When
                                   you choose Follow input (FOLLOW_INPUT), the
                                   service uses the  language  code  from  the
                                   input  track if it's present. If there's no
                                   languge code on the input track,  the  ser-
                                   vice  uses the code that you specify in the
                                   setting Language code (languageCode or cus-
                                   tomLanguageCode).  When you choose Use con-
                                   figured (USE_CONFIGURED), the service  uses
                                   the language code that you specify.

                                      Specify the  number  of  audio  channels
                                      from  your input that you want to use in
                                      your output. With  remixing,  you  might
                                      combine or split the data in these chan-
                                      nels, so the number of channels in  your
                                      final  output might be different. If you
                                      are doing both input channel mapping and
                                      output  channel  mapping,  the number of
                                      output channels in  your  input  mapping
                                      must  be the same as the number of input
                                      channels in your output mapping.

                                      Specify the number of channels  in  this
                                      output  after remixing. Valid values: 1,
                                      2, 4, 6, 8... 64. (1 and even numbers to
                                      64.) If you are doing both input channel
                                      mapping and output channel mapping,  the
                                      number  of output channels in your input
                                      mapping must be the same as  the  number
                                      of  input  channels  in your output map-

                                   mation  in the output captions metadata. If
                                   your output captions format is  DVB-Sub  or
                                   Burn  in,  the  encoder  uses this language

                                   to  one output captions track. Depending on
                                   your output captions format, one tab  might
                                   correspond  to  a  set  of  output captions

                                          (XPosition) of the  captions,  rela-
                                          tive  to the left side of the output
                                          in  pixels.  A  value  of  10  would
                                          result  in  the captions starting 10
                                          pixels from the left of the  output.
                                          If  no  explicit  x_position is pro-
                                          vided, the horizontal caption  posi-

                                          the top of the output in  pixels.  A
                                          value of 10 would result in the cap-
                                          tions starting 10  pixels  from  the
                                          top  of  the  output. If no explicit
                                          y_position is provided, the  caption
                                          will  be positioned towards the bot-
                                          tom of the output.

                                   DestinationType -> (string)
                                      Specify the format for this set of  cap-
                                      tions on this output. The default format
                                      is embedded without SCTE-20.  Note  that
                                      your  choice  of  video output container
                                      constrains your choice  of  output  cap-

                                          other than None (NONE). MediaConvert
                                          uses   these   values  to  determine

                                          Convert uses a supported  font  that
                                          most  closely  matches the font that
                                          your input  captions  specify.  When
                                          there are multiple unsupported fonts
                                          in your input captions, MediaConvert
                                          matches each font with the supported
                                          font that  matches  best.  When  you
                                          explicitly   choose   a  replacement
                                          font, MediaConvert uses that font to
                                          replace  all  unsupported fonts from
                                          your input.

                                   and audio. For this situation, choose Match
                                   video duration  (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION).  In
                                   all  other  cases,  keep the default value,
                                   Default codec duration (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURA-
                                   TION).  When  you  choose Match video dura-
                                   tion, MediaConvert pads  the  output  audio
                                   streams  with  silence  or  trims  them  to
                                   ensure that  the  total  duration  of  each
                                   audio  stream  is  at  least as long as the
                                   total duration of the video  stream.  After
                                   padding or trimming, the audio stream dura-
                                   tion is no more than one frame longer  than
                                   the   video  stream.  MediaConvert  applies
                                   audio padding or trimming only to  the  end
                                   of  the  last  segment  of  the output. For
                                   unsegmented outputs, MediaConvert adds pad-
                                   ding  only to the end of the file. When you
                                   keep the default value, any minor  discrep-

                                   will depend on your output audio codec.

                                   For example, if you  specify  "audio_aac_1"
                                   for Audio group ID, it appears in your man-

                                   Use  a  comma-separated  list. For example,
                                   say you want to include the audio rendition
                                   groups   that  have  the  audio  group  IDs
                                   "audio_aac_1" and "audio_dolby".  Then  you
                                   would       specify       this       value:

                                   and associates it with every video variant.
                                   Each value in your list appears in your HLS

                                   this rendition. You might use this manifest
                                   as  part of a workflow that creates preview
                                   functions for your video. MediaConvert adds

                            Container -> (string)
                               Container  for  this  output.  Some  containers
                               require a container  settings  object.  If  not
                               specified,  the default object will be created.

                            F4vSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings for F4v container

                               MoovPlacement -> (string)
                                   If set to  PROGRESSIVE_DOWNLOAD,  the  MOOV
                                   atom  is  relocated to the beginning of the
                                   archive as required for  progressive  down-
                                   loading. Otherwise it is placed normally at
                                   the end.

                            M2tsSettings -> (structure)
                               MPEG-2 TS container settings.  These  apply  to
                               outputs  in  a  File output group when the out-
                               put's  container  (ContainerType)   is   MPEG-2
                               Transport  Stream (M2TS). In these assets, data
                               is organized by the program  map  table  (PMT).
                               Each  transport stream program contains subsets
                               of data, including audio, video, and  metadata.
                               Each  of  these subsets of data has a numerical
                               label called a packet  identifier  (PID).  Each
                               transport  stream  program  corresponds  to one
                               MediaConvert output. The PMT lists the types of
                               data  in  a program along with their PID. Down-
                               stream systems and players use the program  map
                               table  to look up the PID for each type of data
                               it accesses and then uses the  PIDs  to  locate
                               specific data within the asset.

                               AudioBufferModel -> (string)
                                   Selects  between  the  DVB  and ATSC buffer
                                   models for Dolby Digital audio.

                               AudioDuration -> (string)
                                   Specify this setting only when your  output
                                   will  be consumed by a downstream repackag-
                                   ing workflow  that  is  sensitive  to  very
                                   small  duration  differences  between video
                                   and audio. For this situation, choose Match
                                   video  duration  (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION). In
                                   all other cases, keep  the  default  value,
                                   Default codec duration (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURA-
                                   TION). When you choose  Match  video  dura-
                                   tion,  MediaConvert  pads  the output audio
                                   streams  with  silence  or  trims  them  to
                                   ensure  that  the  total  duration  of each
                                   audio stream is at least  as  long  as  the
                                   total  duration  of the video stream. After
                                   padding or trimming, the audio stream dura-
                                   tion  is no more than one frame longer than
                                   the  video  stream.  MediaConvert   applies
                                   audio  padding  or trimming only to the end
                                   of the last  segment  of  the  output.  For
                                   unsegmented outputs, MediaConvert adds pad-
                                   ding only to the end of the file. When  you
                                   keep  the default value, any minor discrep-
                                   ancies between  audio  and  video  duration
                                   will depend on your output audio codec.

                               AudioFramesPerPes -> (integer)
                                   The  number  of  audio frames to insert for
                                   each PES packet.

                               AudioPids -> (list)
                                   Specify the packet identifiers  (PIDs)  for
                                   any elementary audio streams you include in
                                   this output. Specify  multiple  PIDs  as  a
                                   JSON array. Default is the range 482-492.

                                   (integer)

                               Bitrate -> (integer)
                                   Specify the output bitrate of the transport
                                   stream in bits per  second.  Setting  to  0
                                   lets  the muxer automatically determine the
                                   appropriate bitrate.  Other  common  values
                                   are 3750000, 7500000, and 15000000.

                                   rate interleaving. If set to MULTIPLEX, use
                                   multiplex  buffer  model.  If  set to NONE,
                                   this  can  lead  to  lower   latency,   but
                                   low-memory  devices may not be able to play
                                   back the stream without interruptions.

                               DataPTSControl -> (string)
                                   If you select ALIGN_TO_VIDEO,  MediaConvert
                                   writes  captions and data packets with Pre-
                                   sentation Timestamp  (PTS)  values  greater
                                   than or equal to the first video packet PTS
                                   (MediaConvert drops captions and data pack-
                                   ets  with  lesser  PTS  values).  Keep  the
                                   default value (AUTO) to allow all PTS  val-
                                   ues.

                                   Selects which PIDs to place EBP markers on.
                                   They can either be placed only on the video
                                   PID, or on both the video PID and all audio
                                   PIDs. Only applicable when EBP segmentation
                                   markers  are is selected (segmentationMark-

                               ForceTsVideoEbpOrder -> (string)
                                   Keep the default value (DEFAULT) unless you
                                   know that your audio EBP markers are incor-
                                   rectly  appearing  before  your  video  EBP
                                   markers. To correct this problem, set  this
                                   value to Force (FORCE).

                               FragmentTime -> (double)
                                   The  length,  in seconds, of each fragment.
                                   Only used with EBP markers.

                               MaxPcrInterval -> (integer)
                                   Specify the maximum time, in  milliseconds,
                                   between  Program  Clock  References  (PCRs)
                                   inserted into the transport stream.

                               MinEbpInterval -> (integer)
                                   When set, enforces  that  Encoder  Boundary
                                   Points  do  not  come  within the specified
                                   time interval  of  each  other  by  looking
                                   ahead  at  input  video.  If another EBP is
                                   going to come in within the specified  time
                                   interval,  the  current EBP is not emitted,
                                   and the segment is "stretched" to the  next
                                   marker.  The  lookahead  value does not add
                                   latency to the system. The Live Event  must

                                   input  audio and an equivalent ID3 tag will
                                   be inserted in the output.

                               NullPacketBitrate -> (double)
                                   Value in bits  per  second  of  extra  null
                                   packets   to   insert  into  the  transport
                                   stream. This can be used  if  a  downstream
                                   encryption  system  requires  periodic null
                                   packets.

                               PatInterval -> (integer)

                                   instances  of  this  table  in  the  output
                                   transport stream.

                               PcrControl -> (string)
                                   When set to PCR_EVERY_PES_PACKET, a Program
                                   Clock Reference value is inserted for every
                                   Packetized Elementary Stream (PES)  header.
                                   This  is effective only when the PCR PID is
                                   the same as the video or  audio  elementary
                                   stream.

                               PcrPid -> (integer)
                                   Specify the packet identifier (PID) for the
                                   program clock reference (PCR) in this  out-
                                   put.  If  you  do  not specify a value, the
                                   service will use the value  for  Video  PID
                                   (VideoPid).

                               PmtInterval -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the number of milliseconds between
                                   instances of the program map table (PMT) in
                                   the output transport stream.

                               PmtPid -> (integer)
                                   Specify the packet identifier (PID) for the
                                   program map table (PMT) itself. Default  is
                                   480.

                               PrivateMetadataPid -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the packet identifier (PID) of the
                                   private metadata stream. Default is 503.

                               ProgramNumber -> (integer)
                                   Use Program number (programNumber) to spec-
                                   ify  the program number used in the program
                                   map table (PMT) for this output. Default is
                                   1.  Program  numbers and program map tables
                                   are parts of MPEG-2 transport  stream  con-
                                   tainers, used for organizing data.

                               RateMode -> (string)
                                   When  set to CBR, inserts null packets into
                                   transport stream to fill specified bitrate.
                                   When  set  to VBR, the bitrate setting acts
                                   as the maximum bitrate, but the output will
                                   not be padded up to that bitrate.

                               Scte35Esam -> (structure)
                                   Include  this  in  your job settings to put
                                   SCTE-35 markers in your HLS  and  transport
                                   stream outputs at the insertion points that
                                   you specify in an ESAM XML  document.  Pro-

                                   (sccXml).

                                   Scte35EsamPid -> (integer)
                                      Packet Identifier (PID) of  the  SCTE-35
                                      stream in the transport stream generated
                                      by ESAM.

                               Scte35Pid -> (integer)
                                   Specify the packet identifier (PID) of  the
                                   SCTE-35 stream in the transport stream.

                               Scte35Source -> (string)
                                   For   SCTE-35  markers  from  your  input--
                                   Choose  Passthrough  (PASSTHROUGH)  if  you
                                   want  SCTE-35  markers  that appear in your
                                   input to also appear in this output. Choose
                                   None (NONE) if you don't want SCTE-35 mark-
                                   ers in this  output.  For  SCTE-35  markers
                                   from  an  ESAM  XML  document-- Choose None
                                   (NONE). Also provide  the  ESAM  XML  as  a

                               SegmentationMarkers -> (string)
                                   Inserts segmentation markers at  each  seg-
                                   mentation_time  period.  rai_segstart  sets
                                   the Random  Access  Indicator  bit  in  the
                                   adaptation  field.  rai_adapt  sets the RAI
                                   bit and adds the current  timecode  in  the
                                   private  data  bytes.  psi_segstart inserts
                                   PAT and PMT tables at  the  start  of  seg-
                                   ments.  ebp  adds  Encoder  Boundary  Point
                                   information to the adaptation field as  per
                                   OpenCable                     specification
                                   OC-SP-EBP-I01-130118.    ebp_legacy    adds
                                   Encoder  Boundary  Point information to the
                                   adaptation field using a legacy proprietary
                                   format.

                               SegmentationStyle -> (string)
                                   The  segmentation  style parameter controls
                                   how segmentation markers are inserted  into
                                   the  transport  stream.  With avails, it is
                                   possible that segments  may  be  truncated,
                                   which  can influence where future segmenta-
                                   tion markers are inserted. When a segmenta-
                                   tion  style  of "reset_cadence" is selected
                                   and a segment is truncated due to an avail,
                                   we  will  reset  the  segmentation cadence.
                                   This means the subsequent segment will have
                                   a  duration  of  of $segmentation_time sec-
                                   onds. When a segmentation style  of  "main-
                                   tain_cadence"  is selected and a segment is
                                   truncated due to  an  avail,  we  will  not
                                   reset  the segmentation cadence. This means
                                   the subsequent segment will likely be trun-
                                   cated  as well. However, all segments after
                                   that will have  a  duration  of  $segmenta-
                                   tion_time  seconds. Note that EBP lookahead
                                   is a slight exception to this rule.

                               SegmentationTime -> (double)
                                   Specify the length,  in  seconds,  of  each
                                   segment.  Required unless markers is set to
                                   _none_.

                               TimedMetadataPid -> (integer)
                                   Specify the  packet  identifier  (PID)  for
                                   timed  metadata  in this output. Default is
                                   502.

                               TransportStreamId -> (integer)
                                   Specify the ID  for  the  transport  stream
                                   itself  in  the  program map table for this
                                   output. Transport stream  IDs  and  program
                                   map  tables  are  parts of MPEG-2 transport
                                   stream  containers,  used  for   organizing
                                   data.

                               VideoPid -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the packet identifier (PID) of the

                                   stream.

                            M3u8Settings -> (structure)
                               These  settings  relate to the MPEG-2 transport
                               stream (MPEG2-TS) container  for  the  MPEG2-TS
                               segments in your HLS outputs.

                               AudioDuration -> (string)
                                   Specify  this setting only when your output
                                   will be consumed by a downstream  repackag-
                                   ing  workflow  that  is  sensitive  to very

                                   be included per 14496-1 amendment  1.  This
                                   improves  compatibility  with Apple players
                                   and tools.

                               Mpeg2FourCCControl -> (string)
                                   When  set  to  XDCAM,  writes  MPEG2  video
                                   streams into the QuickTime file using XDCAM
                                   fourcc codes. This increases  compatibility
                                   with  Apple  editors  and  players, but may
                                   decrease compatibility with other  players.
                                   Only  applicable  when  the  video codec is
                                   MPEG2.

                               PaddingControl -> (string)
                                   To make this output compatible with Omenon,
                                   keep  the default value, OMNEON. Unless you
                                   need Omneon compatibility, set  this  value
                                   to  NONE.  When you keep the default value,
                                   OMNEON, MediaConvert increases  the  length
                                   of  the  edit  list  atom. This might cause
                                   file rejections when  a  recipient  of  the
                                   output  file  doesn't expct this extra pad-

                               AudioDuration -> (string)
                                   Specify  this setting only when your output
                                   will be consumed by a downstream  repackag-

                                   video duration  (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION).  In
                                   all  other  cases,  keep the default value,

                                   padding or trimming, the audio stream dura-
                                   tion is no more than one frame longer  than
                                   the   video  stream.  MediaConvert  applies
                                   audio padding or trimming only to  the  end
                                   of  the  last  segment  of  the output. For
                                   unsegmented outputs, MediaConvert adds pad-

                                   B-frames  will  be  negative,  and a 'cslg'
                                   (composition shift least greatest) box will
                                   be  included  per 14496-1 amendment 1. This
                                   improves compatibility with  Apple  players
                                   and tools.

                               CttsVersion -> (integer)
                                   Ignore  this  setting  unless compliance to
                                   the CTTS box version specification  matters
                                   in  your  workflow. Specify a value of 1 to
                                   set your CTTS box version  to  1  and  make
                                   your  output  compliant with the specifica-
                                   tion. When you specify a value  of  1,  you
                                   must  also  set CSLG atom (cslgAtom) to the
                                   value INCLUDE. Keep the default value 0  to
                                   set  your  CTTS  box version to 0. This can
                                   provide  backward  compatibility  for  some
                                   players and packagers.

                               FreeSpaceBox -> (string)
                                   Inserts  a free-space box immediately after
                                   the moov box.

                               MoovPlacement -> (string)
                                   If set to  PROGRESSIVE_DOWNLOAD,  the  MOOV
                                   atom  is  relocated to the beginning of the
                                   archive as required for  progressive  down-
                                   loading. Otherwise it is placed normally at
                                   the end.

                               Mp4MajorBrand -> (string)
                                   Overrides the "Major Brand"  field  in  the
                                   output file. Usually not necessary to spec-
                                   ify.

                            MpdSettings -> (structure)
                               These settings relate  to  the  fragmented  MP4
                               container  for  the  segments in your DASH out-
                               puts.

                               AccessibilityCaptionHints -> (string)
                                   Optional. Choose Include (INCLUDE) to  have
                                   MediaConvert  mark  up  your  DASH manifest
                                   with elements for  embedded  608  captions.
                                   This  markup  isn't generally required, but
                                   some video players require it  to  discover
                                   and  play  embedded  608 captions. Keep the
                                   default value, Exclude (EXCLUDE), to  leave
                                   these  elements  out.  When you enable this
                                   setting, this is the markup that  MediaCon-
                                   vert includes in your manifest:

                               AudioDuration -> (string)
                                   Specify  this setting only when your output
                                   will be consumed by a downstream  repackag-
                                   ing  workflow  that  is  sensitive  to very
                                   small duration  differences  between  video
                                   and audio. For this situation, choose Match
                                   video duration  (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION).  In
                                   all  other  cases,  keep the default value,
                                   Default codec duration (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURA-
                                   TION).  When  you  choose Match video dura-
                                   tion, MediaConvert pads  the  output  audio
                                   streams  with  silence  or  trims  them  to
                                   ensure that  the  total  duration  of  each
                                   audio  stream  is  at  least as long as the
                                   total duration of the video  stream.  After
                                   padding or trimming, the audio stream dura-
                                   tion is no more than one frame longer  than
                                   the   video  stream.  MediaConvert  applies
                                   audio padding or trimming only to  the  end
                                   of  the  last  segment  of  the output. For
                                   unsegmented outputs, MediaConvert adds pad-
                                   ding  only to the end of the file. When you
                                   keep the default value, any minor  discrep-
                                   ancies  between  audio  and  video duration
                                   will depend on your output audio codec.

                               CaptionContainerType -> (string)
                                   Use this setting only in DASH output groups
                                   that include sidecar TTML or IMSC captions.
                                   You specify sidecar captions in a  separate
                                   output  from  your  audio and video. Choose
                                   Raw (RAW) for captions in a single XML file
                                   in   a  raw  container.  Choose  Fragmented
                                   MPEG-4 (FRAGMENTED_MP4) for captions in XML
                                   format   contained  within  fragmented  MP4
                                   files. This set of fragmented MP4 files  is
                                   separate  from  your  video and audio frag-
                                   mented MP4 files.

                               Scte35Esam -> (string)
                                   Use this  setting  only  when  you  specify
                                   SCTE-35 markers from ESAM. Choose INSERT to
                                   put SCTE-35 markers in this output  at  the
                                   insertion  points  that  you  specify in an
                                   ESAM XML document. Provide the document  in
                                   the setting SCC XML (sccXml).

                               Scte35Source -> (string)
                                   Ignore this setting unless you have SCTE-35
                                   markers in your input  video  file.  Choose
                                   Passthrough   (PASSTHROUGH)   if  you  want
                                   SCTE-35 markers that appear in  your  input
                                   to  also appear in this output. Choose None
                                   (NONE) if  you  don't  want  those  SCTE-35
                                   markers in this output.

                               TimedMetadata -> (string)
                                   Applies  to  DASH outputs. Use this setting
                                   to specify whether the service inserts  the
                                   ID3  timed  metadata from the input in this
                                   output.

                            MxfSettings -> (structure)
                               These settings relate to your MXF  output  con-

                               AfdSignaling -> (string)
                                   Optional.  When  you have AFD signaling set
                                   up in your output video  stream,  use  this
                                   setting  to  choose whether to also include
                                   it in the MXF wrapper.  Choose  Don't  copy
                                   (NO_COPY) to exclude AFD signaling from the
                                   MXF wrapper. Choose Copy from video  stream
                                   (COPY_FROM_VIDEO)  to  copy  the AFD values
                                   from the video stream for  this  output  to
                                   the MXF wrapper. Regardless of which option
                                   you choose, the AFD values  remain  in  the
                                   video  stream.  Related settings: To set up

                               Profile -> (string)
                                   Specify the MXF profile, also called  shim,
                                   for  this  output.  When  you  choose Auto,
                                   MediaConvert chooses a profile based on the
                                   video  codec  and resolution. For a list of

                                   DurationMode -> (string)
                                      To  create  an output that complies with
                                      the  XAVC  file  format  guidelines  for

                                   MaxAncDataSize -> (integer)
                                      Specify a value for  this  setting  only
                                      for  outputs that you set up with one of
                                      these two XAVC profiles: XAVC  HD  Intra
                                      CBG (XAVC_HD_INTRA_CBG) or XAVC 4K Intra
                                      CBG  (XAVC_4K_INTRA_CBG).  Specify   the
                                      amount  of  space in each frame that the
                                      service  reserves  for  ancillary  data,
                                      such  as  teletext captions. The default
                                      value for this setting is 1492 bytes per
                                      frame. This should be sufficient to pre-
                                      vent overflow unless you  have  multiple
                                      pages  of teletext captions data. If you
                                      have a large amount  of  teletext  data,
                                      specify a larger number.

                        Extension -> (string)
                            Use  Extension  (Extension)  to  specify  the file
                            extension for outputs in File  output  groups.  If
                            you  do  not specify a value, the service will use
                            default extensions by container type as follows  *
                            MPEG-2  transport  stream, m2ts * Quicktime, mov *

                            accepts format identifiers. For DASH ISO  outputs,
                            if  you  use  the  format  identifiers $Number$ or
                            $Time$ in one output, you must  use  them  in  the
                            same way in all outputs of the output group.

                                   rendition.  You  might use this manifest as
                                   part of a  workflow  that  creates  preview
                                   functions for your video. MediaConvert adds

                                   Exclude (EXCLUDE).

                               SegmentModifier -> (string)
                                   Use this  setting  to  add  an  identifying
                                   string to the filename of each segment. The
                                   service adds this string between  the  name
                                   modifier  and segment index number. You can
                                   use format identifiers in the  string.  For

                        Preset -> (string)
                            Use  Preset  (Preset) to specify a preset for your
                            transcoding settings. Provide the system or custom
                            preset  name.  You can specify either Preset (Pre-
                            set) or  Container  settings  (ContainerSettings),
                            but not both.

                        VideoDescription -> (structure)
                            VideoDescription  contains a group of video encod-
                            ing settings. The specific video  settings  depend
                            on  the  video codec that you choose for the prop-
                            erty codec. Include one instance of  VideoDescrip-

                               This  setting only applies to H.264, H.265, and
                               MPEG2  outputs.  Use   Insert   AFD   signaling
                               (AfdSignaling)  to  specify whether the service
                               includes AFD values in the  output  video  data
                               and  what  those  values  are. * Choose None to
                               remove all  AFD  values  from  this  output.  *
                               Choose  Fixed  to  ignore  input AFD values and
                               instead encode the value specified in the  job.
                               *  Choose  Auto  to calculate output AFD values
                               based on the input AFD scaler data.

                            AntiAlias -> (string)
                               The anti-alias filter is automatically  applied
                               to  all  outputs. The service no longer accepts
                               the value DISABLED for AntiAlias. If you  spec-
                               ify  that  in your job, the service will ignore
                               the setting.

                            CodecSettings -> (structure)
                               Video  codec  settings,  (CodecSettings)  under
                               (VideoDescription),  contains the group of set-
                               tings related to video encoding.  The  settings
                               in  this group vary depending on the value that
                               you choose for Video codec  (Codec).  For  each
                               codec  enum  that you choose, define the corre-
                               sponding settings object. The  following  lists
                               the  codec  enum, settings object pairs. * AV1,

                                      Specify the Bit depth (Av1BitDepth). You
                                      can   choose  8-bit  (BIT_8)  or  10-bit
                                      (BIT_10).

                                   FramerateControl -> (string)
                                      If you are using the  console,  use  the
                                      Framerate  setting  to specify the frame
                                      rate for this output.  If  you  want  to
                                      keep  the  same  frame rate as the input
                                      video, choose Follow source. If you want
                                      to  do  frame  rate conversion, choose a
                                      frame rate from  the  dropdown  list  or
                                      choose  Custom.  The framerates shown in
                                      the dropdown list are decimal approxima-
                                      tions  of  fractions. If you choose Cus-

                                      uses for the frame rate for this output.
                                      Choose  INITIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE  if   you
                                      want  the  service to use the frame rate
                                      from the input. Choose SPECIFIED if  you
                                      want  the  service to use the frame rate
                                      you specify in the settings FramerateNu-

                                      using  drop  duplicate  (DUPLICATE_DROP)
                                      for numerically simple conversions, such
                                      as 60 fps to  30  fps.  For  numerically
                                      complex  conversions, you can use inter-
                                      polate (INTERPOLATE) to  avoid  stutter.

                                      sions, especially if your  source  video
                                      has  already  been  converted  from  its
                                      original   cadence,   use    FrameFormer
                                      (FRAMEFORMER)  to  do motion-compensated
                                      interpolation. FrameFormer  chooses  the
                                      best  conversion  method frame by frame.
                                      Note that  using  FrameFormer  increases
                                      the  transcoding  time and incurs a sig-
                                      nificant add-on cost.

                                   FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                      When you use the API for transcode  jobs
                                      that  use frame rate conversion, specify
                                      the frame rate as a fraction. For  exam-
                                      ple,  24000  /  1001  =  23.976 fps. Use
                                      FramerateDenominator  to   specify   the
                                      denominator  of  this  fraction. In this
                                      example, use 1001 for the value of Fram-
                                      erateDenominator.  When you use the con-
                                      sole for transcode jobs that  use  frame
                                      rate  conversion, provide the value as a
                                      decimal number for  Framerate.  In  this
                                      example, specify 23.976.

                                   FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                      When  you use the API for transcode jobs
                                      that use frame rate conversion,  specify
                                      the  frame rate as a fraction. For exam-
                                      ple, 24000 /  1001  =  23.976  fps.  Use
                                      FramerateNumerator to specify the numer-
                                      ator of this fraction. In this  example,
                                      use  24000 for the value of FramerateNu-
                                      merator. When you use  the  console  for
                                      transcode  jobs that use frame rate con-
                                      version, provide the value as a  decimal
                                      number  for  Framerate. In this example,
                                      specify 23.976.

                                   GopSize -> (double)
                                      Specify the GOP length (keyframe  inter-
                                      val)  in  frames. With AV1, MediaConvert
                                      doesn't support GOP length  in  seconds.
                                      This value must be greater than zero and
                                      preferably equal to 1 +  ((numberBFrames
                                      +  1) * x), where x is an integer value.

                                   MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                      Maximum  bitrate  in  bits/second.   For
                                      example,  enter five megabits per second
                                      as 5000000. Required when  Rate  control
                                      mode is QVBR.

                                   NumberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames      ->
                                   (integer)
                                      Specify from the number of B-frames,  in
                                      the  range of 0-15. For AV1 encoding, we
                                      recommend using 7 or 15. Choose a larger
                                      number  for  a lower bitrate and smaller
                                      file size; choose a smaller  number  for
                                      better video quality.

                                   QvbrSettings -> (structure)
                                      Settings  for  quality-defined  variable
                                      bitrate encoding with the  H.265  codec.
                                      Use  these  settings  only  when you set
                                      QVBR for  Rate  control  mode  (RateCon-
                                      trolMode).

                                      QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                                          Use  this  setting only when you set
                                          Rate control mode  (RateControlMode)
                                          to  QVBR. Specify the target quality
                                          level for this output.  MediaConvert
                                          determines  the right number of bits
                                          to use for each part of the video to
                                          maintain  the video quality that you
                                          specify. When you keep  the  default
                                          value,  AUTO,  MediaConvert  picks a
                                          quality  level  for  you,  based  on
                                          characteristics of your input video.
                                          If you prefer to specify  a  quality
                                          level,   specify  a  number  from  1
                                          through 10. Use higher  numbers  for
                                          greater quality. Level 10 results in
                                          nearly  lossless  compression.   The
                                          quality   level   for   most  broad-
                                          cast-quality transcodes is between 6
                                          and  9.  Optionally,  to  specify  a
                                          value between  whole  numbers,  also

                                          to the nearest third of a whole num-
                                          ber.   For   example,   if  you  set
                                          qvbrQualityLevel to 7  and  you  set
                                          qvbrQualityLevelFineTune   to   .25,
                                          your actual QVBR  quality  level  is
                                          7.33.

                                   RateControlMode -> (string)

                                   Slices -> (integer)
                                      Specify the number of  slices  per  pic-
                                      ture. This value must be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16,
                                      or 32. For  progressive  pictures,  this
                                      value  must be less than or equal to the
                                      number of macroblock  rows.  For  inter-
                                      laced  pictures, this value must be less
                                      than or equal to half the number of mac-
                                      roblock rows.

                                   SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)

                                      content complexity. When you enable this
                                      feature,  the encoder uses fewer bits on
                                      areas that can sustain  more  distortion
                                      with  no  noticeable  visual degradation
                                      and uses more bits on  areas  where  any
                                      small distortion will be noticeable. For
                                      example,  complex  textured  blocks  are
                                      encoded  with fewer bits and smooth tex-
                                      tured blocks are encoded with more bits.
                                      Enabling this feature will almost always
                                      improve  your   video   quality.   Note,
                                      though,  that  this feature doesn't take

                                      determines the  output  video  bit  rate
                                      depending  on the frame rate of the out-
                                      put. Outputs with  higher  class  values
                                      have  higher bitrates and improved image
                                      quality.  Note  that  for  Class  4K/2K,
                                      MediaConvert  supports only 4:2:2 chroma
                                      subsampling.

                                   AvcIntraUhdSettings -> (structure)
                                      Optional when you  set  AVC-Intra  class
                                      (avcIntraClass)     to    Class    4K/2K
                                      (CLASS_4K_2K). When  you  set  AVC-Intra
                                      class  to a different value, this object
                                      isn't allowed.

                                      QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                          Optional. Use Quality  tuning  level
                                          (qualityTuningLevel)  to  choose how
                                          many transcoding passes MediaConvert
                                          does   with  your  video.  When  you
                                          choose Multi-pass (MULTI_PASS), your
                                          video  quality  is  better  and your
                                          output  bitrate  is  more  accurate.
                                          That  is, the actual bitrate of your
                                          output  is  closer  to  the   target
                                          bitrate  defined  in  the specifica-
                                          tion. When  you  choose  Single-pass
                                          (SINGLE_PASS), your encoding time is
                                          faster. The default behavior is Sin-
                                          gle-pass (SINGLE_PASS).

                                   FramerateControl -> (string)
                                      If  you  are  using the console, use the
                                      Framerate setting to specify  the  frame
                                      rate  for  this  output.  If you want to
                                      keep the same frame rate  as  the  input
                                      video, choose Follow source. If you want
                                      to do frame rate  conversion,  choose  a
                                      frame  rate  from  the  dropdown list or
                                      choose Custom. The framerates  shown  in
                                      the dropdown list are decimal approxima-
                                      tions of fractions. If you  choose  Cus-
                                      tom,  specify your frame rate as a frac-

                                      without the console,  use  FramerateCon-
                                      trol  to specify which value the service
                                      uses for the frame rate for this output.
                                      Choose   INITIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE  if  you
                                      want the service to use the  frame  rate
                                      from  the input. Choose SPECIFIED if you
                                      want the service to use the  frame  rate
                                      you specify in the settings FramerateNu-
                                      merator and FramerateDenominator.

                                   FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                      Choose the method that you  want  Media-
                                      Convert   to   use  when  increasing  or
                                      decreasing the frame rate. We  recommend
                                      using  drop  duplicate  (DUPLICATE_DROP)
                                      for numerically simple conversions, such
                                      as  60  fps  to  30 fps. For numerically
                                      complex conversions, you can use  inter-
                                      polate  (INTERPOLATE)  to avoid stutter.
                                      This results in a  smooth  picture,  but
                                      might  introduce undesirable video arti-
                                      facts. For complex  frame  rate  conver-
                                      sions,  especially  if your source video
                                      has  already  been  converted  from  its
                                      original    cadence,   use   FrameFormer
                                      (FRAMEFORMER) to  do  motion-compensated
                                      interpolation.  FrameFormer  chooses the
                                      best conversion method frame  by  frame.
                                      Note  that  using  FrameFormer increases
                                      the transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                      nificant add-on cost.

                                   FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                      When  you use the API for transcode jobs
                                      that use frame rate conversion,  specify
                                      the  frame rate as a fraction. For exam-
                                      ple, 24000 /  1001  =  23.976  fps.  Use
                                      FramerateDenominator   to   specify  the
                                      denominator of this  fraction.  In  this
                                      example, use 1001 for the value of Fram-
                                      erateDenominator. When you use the  con-
                                      sole  for  transcode jobs that use frame
                                      rate conversion, provide the value as  a
                                      decimal  number  for  Framerate. In this
                                      example, specify 23.976.

                                   FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                      When you use the API for transcode  jobs
                                      that  use frame rate conversion, specify
                                      the frame rate as a fraction. For  exam-
                                      ple,  24000  /  1001  =  23.976 fps. Use
                                      FramerateNumerator to specify the numer-
                                      ator  of this fraction. In this example,
                                      use 24000 for the value of  FramerateNu-
                                      merator.  When  you  use the console for
                                      transcode jobs that use frame rate  con-
                                      version,  provide the value as a decimal
                                      number for Framerate. In  this  example,
                                      specify 23.976.

                                   InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                      Choose  the  scan line type for the out-
                                      put. Keep the default value, Progressive
                                      (PROGRESSIVE)  to  create  a progressive
                                      output, regardless of the scan  type  of
                                      your   input.   Use   Top   field  first
                                      (TOP_FIELD) or Bottom field first  (BOT-
                                      TOM_FIELD)  to  create  an output that's
                                      interlaced with the same field  polarity
                                      throughout.   Use  Follow,  default  top
                                      (FOLLOW_TOP_FIELD)  or  Follow,  default
                                      bottom  (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to produce
                                      outputs with the same field polarity  as
                                      the  source. For jobs that have multiple
                                      inputs, the output field polarity  might
                                      change  over  the  course of the output.
                                      Follow behavior  depends  on  the  input
                                      scan  type. If the source is interlaced,
                                      the output will be interlaced  with  the
                                      same  polarity  as  the  source.  If the
                                      source is progressive, the  output  will
                                      be  interlaced  with  top  field  bottom
                                      field first, depending on which  of  the
                                      Follow options you choose.

                                   ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                                      Use this setting for interlaced outputs,
                                      when your output frame rate is  half  of
                                      your  input  frame  rate. In this situa-
                                      tion,   choose   Optimized   interlacing
                                      (INTERLACED_OPTIMIZE) to create a better
                                      quality interlaced output. In this case,
                                      each  progressive  frame  from the input
                                      corresponds to an  interlaced  field  in
                                      the  output.  Keep  the  default  value,
                                      Basic interlacing (INTERLACED), for  all
                                      other  output  frame  rates.  With basic
                                      interlacing, MediaConvert  performs  any
                                      frame  rate  conversion  first  and then
                                      interlaces the frames. When  you  choose
                                      Optimized  interlacing  and you set your
                                      output frame rate to a value that  isn't
                                      suitable   for   optimized  interlacing,
                                      MediaConvert automatically falls back to
                                      basic interlacing. Required settings: To
                                      use optimized interlacing, you must  set
                                      Telecine  (telecine)  to  None (NONE) or
                                      Soft (SOFT).  You  can't  use  optimized
                                      interlacing  for  hard telecine outputs.
                                      You must also set Interlace mode (inter-
                                      laceMode) to a value other than Progres-
                                      sive (PROGRESSIVE).

                                   SlowPal -> (string)
                                      Ignore this setting  unless  your  input
                                      frame  rate  is  23.976 or 24 frames per
                                      second (fps). Enable slow PAL to  create
                                      a  25  fps  output. When you enable slow
                                      PAL,  MediaConvert  relabels  the  video
                                      frames  to  25  fps  and  resamples your
                                      audio to keep it synchronized  with  the
                                      video.  Note  that enabling this setting
                                      will slightly  reduce  the  duration  of
                                      your  video. Required settings: You must

                                   Telecine -> (string)
                                      When you do frame rate  conversion  from
                                      23.976  frames per second (fps) to 29.97
                                      fps, and your output scan type is inter-
                                      laced,  you  can  optionally enable hard
                                      telecine (HARD)  to  create  a  smoother
                                      picture.   When  you  keep  the  default
                                      value, None (NONE), MediaConvert does  a
                                      standard  frame rate conversion to 29.97
                                      without doing anything  with  the  field
                                      polarity to create a smoother picture.

                               Codec -> (string)
                                   Specifies  the  video  codec.  This must be
                                   equal to one of the enum values defined  by
                                   the object VideoCodec.

                               FrameCaptureSettings -> (structure)
                                   Required   when   you   set  (Codec)  under

                                   value FRAME_CAPTURE.

                                   FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                      Frame  capture  will  encode  the  first
                                      frame of the  output  stream,  then  one

                                      framerateDenominator = 3 (a rate of  1/3
                                      frame per second) will capture the first
                                      frame, then 1 frame every 3s. Files will
                                      be named as filename.NNNNNNN.jpg where N
                                      is the  0-based  frame  sequence  number
                                      zero padded to 7 decimal places.

                                      JPEG Quality -  a  higher  value  equals
                                      higher quality.

                               H264Settings -> (structure)
                                   Required   when   you   set  (Codec)  under

                                      tent with your output video settings. If
                                      you  aren't  sure what level to specify,
                                      choose Auto (AUTO).

                                   CodecProfile -> (string)
                                      H.264 Profile.  High  4:2:2  and  10-bit

                                      video  quality  for high-motion content.
                                      This will cause the service to use fewer
                                      B-frames  (which infer information based
                                      on other frames)  for  high-motion  por-

                                      value,  PAFF,  to  have MediaConvert use
                                      PAFF encoding  for  interlaced  outputs.
                                      Choose Force field (FORCE_FIELD) to dis-
                                      able PAFF encoding and  create  separate
                                      interlaced  fields. Choose MBAFF to dis-
                                      able  PAFF  and  have  MediaConvert  use
                                      MBAFF encoding for interlaced outputs.

                                   FlickerAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                                      Only  use  this  setting when you change
                                      the default value, AUTO, for the setting
                                      H264AdaptiveQuantization.  When you keep
                                      all  defaults,  excluding  H264Adaptive-
                                      Quantization   and  all  other  adaptive

                                      cation,    MediaConvert    automatically
                                      applies the best types  of  quantization
                                      for  your  video  content.  When you set
                                      H264AdaptiveQuantization  to   a   value
                                      other  than  AUTO, the default value for
                                      H264FlickerAdaptiveQuantization is  Dis-
                                      abled  (DISABLED).  Change this value to
                                      Enabled (ENABLED) to reduce I-frame pop.
                                      I-frame  pop appears as a visual flicker
                                      that can arise when  the  encoder  saves
                                      bits  by  copying  some macroblocks many
                                      times from  frame  to  frame,  and  then
                                      refreshes  them at the I-frame. When you
                                      enable this setting, the encoder updates
                                      these macroblocks slightly more often to
                                      smooth  out  the  flicker.  To  manually
                                      enable  or  disable H264FlickerAdaptive-
                                      Quantization,  you  must  set   Adaptive
                                      quantization  (H264AdaptiveQuantization)
                                      to a value other than AUTO.

                                   FramerateControl -> (string)
                                      If you are using the  console,  use  the
                                      Framerate  setting  to specify the frame

                                      uses for the frame rate for this output.
                                      Choose  INITIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE  if   you

                                   FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                      Choose  the  method that you want Media-
                                      Convert  to  use  when   increasing   or
                                      decreasing  the frame rate. We recommend
                                      using  drop  duplicate  (DUPLICATE_DROP)
                                      for numerically simple conversions, such
                                      as 60 fps to  30  fps.  For  numerically
                                      complex  conversions, you can use inter-
                                      polate (INTERPOLATE) to  avoid  stutter.
                                      This  results  in  a smooth picture, but
                                      might introduce undesirable video  arti-
                                      facts.  For  complex  frame rate conver-
                                      sions, especially if your  source  video
                                      has  already  been  converted  from  its
                                      original   cadence,   use    FrameFormer
                                      (FRAMEFORMER)  to  do motion-compensated
                                      interpolation. FrameFormer  chooses  the
                                      best  conversion  method frame by frame.
                                      Note that  using  FrameFormer  increases
                                      the  transcoding  time and incurs a sig-
                                      nificant add-on cost.

                                   FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                      When you use the API for transcode  jobs
                                      that  use frame rate conversion, specify
                                      the frame rate as a fraction. For  exam-
                                      ple,  24000  /  1001  =  23.976 fps. Use
                                      FramerateDenominator  to   specify   the
                                      denominator  of  this  fraction. In this
                                      example, use 1001 for the value of Fram-
                                      erateDenominator.  When you use the con-
                                      sole for transcode jobs that  use  frame
                                      rate  conversion, provide the value as a
                                      decimal number for  Framerate.  In  this
                                      example, specify 23.976.

                                   FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                      When  you use the API for transcode jobs
                                      that use frame rate conversion,  specify
                                      the  frame rate as a fraction. For exam-
                                      ple, 24000 /  1001  =  23.976  fps.  Use
                                      FramerateNumerator to specify the numer-
                                      ator of this fraction. In this  example,
                                      use  24000 for the value of FramerateNu-
                                      merator. When you use  the  console  for
                                      transcode  jobs that use frame rate con-
                                      version, provide the value as a  decimal
                                      number  for  Framerate. In this example,
                                      specify 23.976.

                                   GopBReference -> (string)
                                      If enable, use reference  B  frames  for
                                      GOP structures that have B frames > 1.

                                   GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                                      Specify  the  relative frequency of open
                                      to closed GOPs in this output. For exam-
                                      ple, if you want to allow four open GOPs
                                      and then require a closed GOP, set  this
                                      value  to  5. We recommend that you have
                                      the transcoder automatically choose this
                                      value  for  you based on characteristics
                                      of your  input  video.  To  enable  this
                                      automatic  behavior,  keep  the  default
                                      value by leaving  this  setting  out  of
                                      your JSON job specification. In the con-
                                      sole, do this  by  keeping  the  default
                                      empty  value. If you do explicitly spec-
                                      ify  a  value,  for  segmented  outputs,
                                      don't set this value to 0.

                                   GopSize -> (double)
                                      Use  this  setting only when you set GOP
                                      mode control  (GopSizeUnits)  to  Speci-
                                      fied, frames (FRAMES) or Specified, sec-
                                      onds (SECONDS). Specify the  GOP  length
                                      using a whole number of frames or a dec-
                                      imal value of seconds. MediaConvert will
                                      interpret  this  value as frames or sec-
                                      onds depending on the value  you  choose
                                      for  GOP mode control (GopSizeUnits). If
                                      you want to allow MediaConvert to  auto-
                                      matically  determine GOP size, leave GOP
                                      size blank and set GOP mode  control  to
                                      Auto (AUTO). If your output group speci-
                                      fies HLS, DASH, or CMAF, leave GOP  size
                                      blank  and  set GOP mode control to Auto
                                      in each output in your output group.

                                   GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                                      Specify how  the  transcoder  determines
                                      GOP  size  for this output. We recommend
                                      that you have the  transcoder  automati-
                                      cally choose this value for you based on
                                      characteristics of your input video.  To
                                      enable  this  automatic behavior, choose
                                      Auto (AUTO) and and leave GOP size (Gop-
                                      Size)  blank.  By  default, if you don't
                                      specify GOP mode control (GopSizeUnits),
                                      MediaConvert  will  use automatic behav-
                                      ior. If your output group specifies HLS,
                                      DASH,  or  CMAF, set GOP mode control to
                                      Auto and leave GOP size  blank  in  each
                                      output  in your output group. To explic-
                                      itly  specify  the  GOP  length,  choose
                                      Specified, frames (FRAMES) or Specified,
                                      seconds (SECONDS) and then  provide  the
                                      GOP  length  in  the related setting GOP
                                      size (GopSize).

                                   HrdBufferInitialFillPercentage -> (integer)
                                      Percentage  of  the  buffer  that should
                                      initially be filled (HRD buffer  model).

                                   HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                                      Size  of  buffer  (HRD  buffer model) in
                                      bits. For example, enter  five  megabits
                                      as 5000000.

                                   InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                      Choose  the  scan line type for the out-
                                      put. Keep the default value, Progressive
                                      (PROGRESSIVE)  to  create  a progressive
                                      output, regardless of the scan  type  of
                                      your   input.   Use   Top   field  first
                                      (TOP_FIELD) or Bottom field first  (BOT-
                                      TOM_FIELD)  to  create  an output that's
                                      interlaced with the same field  polarity
                                      throughout.   Use  Follow,  default  top
                                      (FOLLOW_TOP_FIELD)  or  Follow,  default
                                      bottom  (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to produce
                                      outputs with the same field polarity  as
                                      the  source. For jobs that have multiple
                                      inputs, the output field polarity  might
                                      change  over  the  course of the output.
                                      Follow behavior  depends  on  the  input
                                      scan  type. If the source is interlaced,
                                      the output will be interlaced  with  the
                                      same  polarity  as  the  source.  If the
                                      source is progressive, the  output  will
                                      be  interlaced  with  top  field  bottom
                                      field first, depending on which  of  the
                                      Follow options you choose.

                                   MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                      Maximum   bitrate  in  bits/second.  For
                                      example, enter five megabits per  second
                                      as  5000000.  Required when Rate control
                                      mode is QVBR.

                                   MinIInterval -> (integer)
                                      Use this  setting  only  when  you  also
                                      enable     Scene     change    detection
                                      (SceneChangeDetect). This setting deter-
                                      mines  how the encoder manages the spac-
                                      ing between I-frames that it inserts  as
                                      part  of  the  I-frame  cadence  and the
                                      I-frames  that  it  inserts  for   Scene
                                      change  detection. We recommend that you
                                      have the transcoder automatically choose
                                      this value for you based on characteris-
                                      tics of your input video. To enable this
                                      automatic  behavior,  keep  the  default
                                      value by leaving  this  setting  out  of
                                      your JSON job specification. In the con-
                                      sole, do this  by  keeping  the  default
                                      empty value. When you explicitly specify
                                      a value for this  setting,  the  encoder
                                      determines    whether    to    skip    a
                                      cadence-driven I-frame by the value  you
                                      set.  For  example,  if  you  set  Min I
                                      interval  (minIInterval)  to  5  and   a

                                      5 frames of a scene-change I-frame, then
                                      the  encoder  skips  the  cadence-driven
                                      I-frame. In this way, one GOP is  shrunk
                                      slightly   and   one  GOP  is  stretched
                                      slightly.   When   the    cadence-driven
                                      I-frames    are    farther    from   the
                                      scene-change I-frame than the value  you
                                      set,   then   the   encoder  leaves  all
                                      I-frames in place and the GOPs surround-
                                      ing  the  scene  change are smaller than
                                      the usual cadence GOPs.

                                      to  allow  the  transcoder to choose the
                                      best value based on  characteristics  of
                                      your input video. In the console, choose
                                      AUTO to select this automatic  behavior.

                                   ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                      Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio

                                      Optional.   Use   Quality  tuning  level
                                      (qualityTuningLevel) to choose  how  you
                                      want  to  trade  off  encoding speed for

                                      bitrate  encoding  with the H.265 codec.
                                      Use these settings  only  when  you  set
                                      QVBR  for  Rate  control  mode (RateCon-
                                      trolMode).

                                      MaxAverageBitrate -> (integer)
                                          Use this setting only when Rate con-
                                          trol mode is QVBR and Quality tuning
                                          level  is  Multi-pass  HQ.  For  Max
                                          average bitrate values suited to the
                                          complexity of your input video,  the
                                          service  limits  the average bitrate
                                          of the video part of this output  to
                                          the  value that you choose. That is,
                                          the total size of the video  element
                                          is  less  than or equal to the value
                                          you set multiplied by the number  of
                                          seconds of encoded output.

                                      QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                                          Use  this  setting only when you set
                                          Rate control mode  (RateControlMode)
                                          to  QVBR. Specify the target quality
                                          level for this output.  MediaConvert
                                          determines  the right number of bits
                                          to use for each part of the video to
                                          maintain  the video quality that you
                                          specify. When you keep  the  default
                                          value,  AUTO,  MediaConvert  picks a
                                          quality  level  for  you,  based  on
                                          characteristics of your input video.
                                          If you prefer to specify  a  quality
                                          level,   specify  a  number  from  1
                                          through 10. Use higher  numbers  for
                                          greater quality. Level 10 results in
                                          nearly  lossless  compression.   The
                                          quality   level   for   most  broad-
                                          cast-quality transcodes is between 6

                                      Use this setting for interlaced outputs,
                                      when your output frame rate is  half  of
                                      your  input  frame  rate. In this situa-
                                      tion,   choose   Optimized   interlacing
                                      (INTERLACED_OPTIMIZE) to create a better
                                      quality interlaced output. In this case,
                                      each  progressive  frame  from the input
                                      corresponds to an  interlaced  field  in

                                      frame  rate  conversion  first  and then
                                      interlaces the frames. When  you  choose
                                      Optimized  interlacing  and you set your
                                      output frame rate to a value that  isn't
                                      suitable   for   optimized  interlacing,
                                      MediaConvert automatically falls back to
                                      basic interlacing. Required settings: To
                                      use optimized interlacing, you must  set
                                      Telecine  (telecine)  to  None (NONE) or
                                      Soft (SOFT).  You  can't  use  optimized
                                      interlacing  for  hard telecine outputs.
                                      You must also set Interlace mode (inter-
                                      laceMode) to a value other than Progres-
                                      sive (PROGRESSIVE).

                                   SlowPal -> (string)
                                      Ignore this setting  unless  your  input
                                      frame  rate  is  23.976 or 24 frames per
                                      second (fps). Enable slow PAL to  create
                                      a  25  fps  output. When you enable slow
                                      PAL,  MediaConvert  relabels  the  video
                                      frames  to  25  fps  and  resamples your
                                      audio to keep it synchronized  with  the
                                      video.  Note  that enabling this setting
                                      will slightly  reduce  the  duration  of
                                      your  video. Required settings: You must
                                      also set Framerate to 25. In  your  JSON
                                      job  specification,  set  (framerateCon-
                                      trol) to (SPECIFIED),  (framerateNumera-
                                      tor) to 25 and (framerateDenominator) to

                                   Softness -> (integer)
                                      Ignore this setting unless you  need  to
                                      comply   with   a   specification   that
                                      requires a specific value. If you  don't
                                      have  a  specification  requirement,  we
                                      recommend that you adjust  the  softness
                                      of  your  output  by using a lower value
                                      for the setting Sharpness (sharpness) or
                                      by   enabling  a  noise  reducer  filter
                                      (noiseReducerFilter).    The    Softness
                                      (softness) setting specifies the quanti-
                                      zation matrices that the  encoder  uses.
                                      Keep  the  default  value,  0,  for flat
                                      quantization. Choose the value 1  or  16
                                      to use the default JVT softening quanti-
                                      zation matricies from the H.264 specifi-
                                      cation. Choose a value from 17 to 128 to
                                      use  planar  interpolation.   Increasing
                                      values from 17 to 128 result in increas-
                                      ing reduction  of  high-frequency  data.
                                      The  value  128  results  in the softest
                                      video.

                                   SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                                      Only use this setting  when  you  change
                                      the  default value, Auto (AUTO), for the
                                      setting  H264AdaptiveQuantization.  When
                                      you   keep   all   defaults,   excluding
                                      H264AdaptiveQuantization and  all  other
                                      adaptive quantization from your JSON job
                                      specification,  MediaConvert   automati-
                                      cally  applies the best types of quanti-
                                      zation for your video content. When  you
                                      set  H264AdaptiveQuantization to a value
                                      other than AUTO, the default  value  for
                                      H264SpatialAdaptiveQuantization       is
                                      Enabled  (ENABLED).  Keep  this  default
                                      value to adjust quantization within each
                                      frame based on spatial variation of con-
                                      tent  complexity.  When  you enable this
                                      feature, the encoder uses fewer bits  on
                                      areas  that  can sustain more distortion
                                      with no  noticeable  visual  degradation
                                      and  uses  more  bits on areas where any
                                      small distortion will be noticeable. For
                                      example,  complex  textured  blocks  are
                                      encoded with fewer bits and smooth  tex-
                                      tured blocks are encoded with more bits.
                                      Enabling this feature will almost always
                                      improve   your   video   quality.  Note,
                                      though, that this feature  doesn't  take
                                      into  account  where the viewer's atten-
                                      tion is likely to  be.  If  viewers  are
                                      likely to be focusing their attention on
                                      a part of the screen with a lot of  com-

                                      abled  (DISABLED). Related setting: When
                                      you enable  spatial  adaptive  quantiza-
                                      tion, set the value for Adaptive quanti-

                                      depending  on  your content. For homoge-
                                      neous  content,  such  as  cartoons  and
                                      video  games, set it to Low. For content
                                      with a wider variety of textures, set it
                                      to High or Higher. To manually enable or
                                      disable H264SpatialAdaptiveQuantization,
                                      you   must   set  Adaptive  quantization
                                      (H264AdaptiveQuantization)  to  a  value
                                      other than AUTO.

                                      fps, and your output scan type is inter-
                                      laced, you can optionally enable hard or
                                      soft telecine to create a smoother  pic-
                                      ture.  Hard  telecine  (HARD) produces a
                                      29.97i output. Soft telecine (SOFT) pro-
                                      duces  an  output  with  a 23.976 output
                                      that signals to the video player  device
                                      to  do  the conversion during play back.
                                      When you keep the  default  value,  None
                                      (NONE),  MediaConvert  does  a  standard
                                      frame rate conversion to  29.97  without
                                      doing  anything  with the field polarity
                                      to create a smoother picture.

                                      for your video  content.  When  you  set
                                      H264AdaptiveQuantization   to   a  value
                                      other than AUTO, the default  value  for
                                      H264TemporalAdaptiveQuantization      is
                                      Enabled  (ENABLED).  Keep  this  default
                                      value to adjust quantization within each
                                      frame based  on  temporal  variation  of
                                      content complexity. When you enable this
                                      feature, the encoder uses fewer bits  on
                                      areas  of  the  frame that aren't moving
                                      and uses more bits  on  complex  objects
                                      with  sharp  edges  that move a lot. For
                                      example, this feature improves the read-
                                      ability of text tickers on newscasts and
                                      scoreboards on sports matches.  Enabling
                                      this  feature will almost always improve
                                      your video quality. Note,  though,  that
                                      this  feature  doesn't take into account
                                      where the viewer's attention  is  likely
                                      to  be.  If  viewers  are  likely  to be

                                      reduce I-frame pop. I-frame pop  appears
                                      as  a visual flicker that can arise when
                                      the encoder saves bits by  copying  some
                                      macroblocks  many  times  from  frame to
                                      frame, and then refreshes  them  at  the
                                      I-frame.  When  you enable this setting,
                                      the encoder  updates  these  macroblocks
                                      slightly  more  often  to smooth out the

                                   FramerateControl -> (string)
                                      If you are using the  console,  use  the
                                      Framerate  setting  to specify the frame
                                      rate for this output.  If  you  want  to
                                      keep  the  same  frame rate as the input
                                      video, choose Follow source. If you want
                                      to  do  frame  rate conversion, choose a
                                      frame rate from  the  dropdown  list  or
                                      choose  Custom.  The framerates shown in

                                      without  the  console, use FramerateCon-

                                      uses for the frame rate for this output.
                                      Choose  INITIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE  if   you
                                      want  the  service to use the frame rate
                                      from the input. Choose SPECIFIED if  you
                                      want  the  service to use the frame rate
                                      you specify in the settings FramerateNu-

                                   FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                      Choose  the  method that you want Media-
                                      Convert  to  use  when   increasing   or
                                      decreasing  the frame rate. We recommend
                                      using  drop  duplicate  (DUPLICATE_DROP)
                                      for numerically simple conversions, such
                                      as 60 fps to  30  fps.  For  numerically
                                      complex  conversions, you can use inter-
                                      polate (INTERPOLATE) to  avoid  stutter.
                                      This  results  in  a smooth picture, but
                                      might introduce undesirable video  arti-
                                      facts.  For  complex  frame rate conver-
                                      sions, especially if your  source  video
                                      has  already  been  converted  from  its

                                      (FRAMEFORMER)  to  do motion-compensated
                                      interpolation. FrameFormer  chooses  the
                                      best  conversion  method frame by frame.
                                      Note that  using  FrameFormer  increases
                                      the  transcoding  time and incurs a sig-
                                      nificant add-on cost.

                                   FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                      When you use the API for transcode  jobs
                                      that  use frame rate conversion, specify
                                      the frame rate as a fraction. For  exam-
                                      ple,  24000  /  1001  =  23.976 fps. Use
                                      FramerateDenominator  to   specify   the
                                      denominator  of  this  fraction. In this
                                      example, use 1001 for the value of Fram-
                                      erateDenominator.  When you use the con-
                                      sole for transcode jobs that  use  frame
                                      rate  conversion, provide the value as a
                                      decimal number for  Framerate.  In  this
                                      example, specify 23.976.

                                   FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                      When  you use the API for transcode jobs
                                      that use frame rate conversion,  specify
                                      the  frame rate as a fraction. For exam-
                                      ple, 24000 /  1001  =  23.976  fps.  Use
                                      FramerateNumerator to specify the numer-
                                      ator of this fraction. In this  example,
                                      use  24000 for the value of FramerateNu-
                                      merator. When you use  the  console  for
                                      transcode  jobs that use frame rate con-
                                      version, provide the value as a  decimal
                                      number  for  Framerate. In this example,
                                      specify 23.976.

                                   GopBReference -> (string)
                                      If enable, use reference  B  frames  for
                                      GOP structures that have B frames > 1.

                                   GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                                      Specify  the  relative frequency of open
                                      to closed GOPs in this output. For exam-
                                      ple, if you want to allow four open GOPs
                                      and then require a closed GOP, set  this
                                      value  to  5. We recommend that you have

                                      automatic  behavior,  keep  the  default
                                      value by leaving  this  setting  out  of
                                      your JSON job specification. In the con-
                                      sole, do this  by  keeping  the  default
                                      empty  value. If you do explicitly spec-
                                      ify  a  value,  for  segmented  outputs,
                                      don't set this value to 0.

                                   GopSize -> (double)
                                      Use  this  setting only when you set GOP
                                      mode control  (GopSizeUnits)  to  Speci-
                                      fied, frames (FRAMES) or Specified, sec-
                                      onds (SECONDS). Specify the  GOP  length
                                      using a whole number of frames or a dec-
                                      imal value of seconds. MediaConvert will
                                      interpret  this  value as frames or sec-
                                      onds depending on the value  you  choose
                                      for  GOP mode control (GopSizeUnits). If
                                      you want to allow MediaConvert to  auto-
                                      matically  determine GOP size, leave GOP
                                      size blank and set GOP mode  control  to
                                      Auto (AUTO). If your output group speci-
                                      fies HLS, DASH, or CMAF, leave GOP  size
                                      blank  and  set GOP mode control to Auto
                                      in each output in your output group.

                                   GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                                      Specify how  the  transcoder  determines
                                      GOP  size  for this output. We recommend
                                      that you have the  transcoder  automati-
                                      cally choose this value for you based on
                                      characteristics of your input video.  To
                                      enable  this  automatic behavior, choose
                                      Auto (AUTO) and and leave GOP size (Gop-
                                      Size)  blank.  By  default, if you don't
                                      specify GOP mode control (GopSizeUnits),
                                      MediaConvert  will  use automatic behav-
                                      ior. If your output group specifies HLS,
                                      DASH,  or  CMAF, set GOP mode control to
                                      Auto and leave GOP size  blank  in  each
                                      output  in your output group. To explic-
                                      itly  specify  the  GOP  length,  choose
                                      Specified, frames (FRAMES) or Specified,
                                      seconds (SECONDS) and then  provide  the
                                      GOP  length  in  the related setting GOP
                                      size (GopSize).

                                   HrdBufferInitialFillPercentage -> (integer)
                                      Percentage  of  the  buffer  that should
                                      initially be filled (HRD buffer  model).

                                   HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                                      Size  of  buffer  (HRD  buffer model) in
                                      bits. For example, enter  five  megabits
                                      as 5000000.

                                   InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                      Choose  the  scan line type for the out-
                                      put. Keep the default value, Progressive
                                      (PROGRESSIVE)  to  create  a progressive
                                      output, regardless of the scan  type  of
                                      your   input.   Use   Top   field  first
                                      (TOP_FIELD) or Bottom field first  (BOT-
                                      TOM_FIELD)  to  create  an output that's
                                      interlaced with the same field  polarity
                                      throughout.   Use  Follow,  default  top
                                      (FOLLOW_TOP_FIELD)  or  Follow,  default
                                      bottom  (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to produce
                                      outputs with the same field polarity  as
                                      the  source. For jobs that have multiple
                                      inputs, the output field polarity  might
                                      change  over  the  course of the output.
                                      Follow behavior  depends  on  the  input
                                      scan  type. If the source is interlaced,
                                      the output will be interlaced  with  the
                                      same  polarity  as  the  source.  If the
                                      source is progressive, the  output  will
                                      be  interlaced  with  top  field  bottom
                                      field first, depending on which  of  the
                                      Follow options you choose.

                                   MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                      Maximum   bitrate  in  bits/second.  For
                                      example, enter five megabits per  second
                                      as  5000000.  Required when Rate control
                                      mode is QVBR.

                                   MinIInterval -> (integer)
                                      Use this  setting  only  when  you  also
                                      enable     Scene     change    detection
                                      (SceneChangeDetect). This setting deter-
                                      mines  how the encoder manages the spac-
                                      ing between I-frames that it inserts  as
                                      part  of  the  I-frame  cadence  and the
                                      I-frames  that  it  inserts  for   Scene
                                      change  detection. We recommend that you
                                      have the transcoder automatically choose
                                      this value for you based on characteris-
                                      tics of your input video. To enable this
                                      automatic  behavior,  keep  the  default
                                      value by leaving  this  setting  out  of
                                      your JSON job specification. In the con-
                                      sole, do this  by  keeping  the  default
                                      empty value. When you explicitly specify
                                      a value for this  setting,  the  encoder
                                      determines    whether    to    skip    a
                                      cadence-driven I-frame by the value  you
                                      set.  For  example,  if  you  set  Min I
                                      interval  (minIInterval)  to  5  and   a
                                      cadence-driven I-frame would fall within
                                      5 frames of a scene-change I-frame, then
                                      the  encoder  skips  the  cadence-driven
                                      I-frame. In this way, one GOP is  shrunk
                                      slightly   and   one  GOP  is  stretched
                                      slightly.   When   the    cadence-driven
                                      I-frames    are    farther    from   the
                                      scene-change I-frame than the value  you
                                      set,   then   the   encoder  leaves  all
                                      I-frames in place and the GOPs surround-
                                      ing  the  scene  change are smaller than
                                      the usual cadence GOPs.

                                   (integer)
                                      Specify  the  number  of  B-frames  that
                                      MediaConvert  puts   between   reference
                                      frames  in this output. Valid values are
                                      whole numbers from 0 through 7. When you
                                      don't   specify  a  value,  MediaConvert
                                      defaults to 2.

                                   NumberReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                                      Number of reference frames to  use.  The
                                      encoder  may  use more than requested if
                                      using B-frames and/or interlaced  encod-
                                      ing.

                                      low   source   (INITIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE),
                                      uses  the  PAR from your input video for
                                      your output. To specify a different  PAR
                                      in  the  console, choose any value other
                                      than Follow source. To specify a differ-

                                      cation,  choose  SPECIFIED.   When   you
                                      choose  SPECIFIED  for this setting, you
                                      must also specify values for the  parNu-
                                      merator and parDenominator settings.

                                   ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                      Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio
                                      (parControl) to SPECIFIED. On  the  con-
                                      sole,  this  corresponds  to  any  value
                                      other than Follow source. When you spec-

                                      For example, for D1/DV NTSC  widescreen,
                                      you  would  specify  the ratio 40:33. In
                                      this example, the value for parDenomina-
                                      tor is 33.

                                   ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                      Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio

                                      is 40.

                                   QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                      Optional.   Use   Quality  tuning  level
                                      (qualityTuningLevel) to choose  how  you
                                      want  to  trade  off  encoding speed for
                                      output video quality. The default behav-
                                      ior   is  faster,  lower  quality,  sin-
                                      gle-pass encoding.

                                   QvbrSettings -> (structure)
                                      Settings  for  quality-defined  variable
                                      bitrate  encoding  with the H.265 codec.
                                      Use these settings  only  when  you  set
                                      QVBR  for  Rate  control  mode (RateCon-
                                      trolMode).

                                      MaxAverageBitrate -> (integer)
                                          Use this setting only when Rate con-
                                          trol mode is QVBR and Quality tuning
                                          level  is  Multi-pass  HQ.  For  Max
                                          average bitrate values suited to the
                                          complexity of your input video,  the
                                          service  limits  the average bitrate
                                          of the video part of this output  to
                                          the  value that you choose. That is,
                                          the total size of the video  element
                                          is  less  than or equal to the value
                                          you set multiplied by the number  of
                                          seconds of encoded output.

                                      QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                                          Use  this  setting only when you set
                                          Rate control mode  (RateControlMode)
                                          to  QVBR. Specify the target quality
                                          level for this output.  MediaConvert
                                          determines  the right number of bits
                                          to use for each part of the video to
                                          maintain  the video quality that you
                                          specify. When you keep  the  default
                                          value,  AUTO,  MediaConvert  picks a
                                          quality  level  for  you,  based  on
                                          characteristics of your input video.
                                          If you prefer to specify  a  quality
                                          level,   specify  a  number  from  1
                                          through 10. Use higher  numbers  for
                                          greater quality. Level 10 results in
                                          nearly  lossless  compression.   The
                                          quality   level   for   most  broad-
                                          cast-quality transcodes is between 6
                                          and  9.  Optionally,  to  specify  a
                                          value between  whole  numbers,  also

                                          Optional. Specify a  value  here  to
                                          set the QVBR quality to a level that
                                          is between whole numbers. For  exam-

                                          vert  rounds your QVBR quality level
                                          to the nearest third of a whole num-
                                          ber.   For   example,   if  you  set

                                          your actual QVBR  quality  level  is
                                          7.33.

                                   RateControlMode -> (string)
                                      Use this setting to specify whether this
                                      output has  a  variable  bitrate  (VBR),
                                      constant    bitrate   (CBR)   or   qual-

                                      filter  strength.  Adaptive mode dynami-
                                      cally selects  best  strength  based  on

                                   ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                                      Use this setting for interlaced outputs,
                                      when your output frame rate is  half  of
                                      your  input  frame  rate. In this situa-
                                      tion,   choose   Optimized   interlacing
                                      (INTERLACED_OPTIMIZE) to create a better
                                      quality interlaced output. In this case,
                                      each  progressive  frame  from the input
                                      corresponds to an  interlaced  field  in
                                      the  output.  Keep  the  default  value,
                                      Basic interlacing (INTERLACED), for  all
                                      other  output  frame  rates.  With basic
                                      interlacing, MediaConvert  performs  any
                                      frame  rate  conversion  first  and then
                                      interlaces the frames. When  you  choose
                                      Optimized  interlacing  and you set your
                                      output frame rate to a value that  isn't
                                      suitable   for   optimized  interlacing,
                                      MediaConvert automatically falls back to
                                      basic interlacing. Required settings: To
                                      use optimized interlacing, you must  set
                                      Telecine  (telecine)  to  None (NONE) or
                                      Soft (SOFT).  You  can't  use  optimized
                                      interlacing  for  hard telecine outputs.
                                      You must also set Interlace mode (inter-
                                      laceMode) to a value other than Progres-
                                      sive (PROGRESSIVE).

                                   SceneChangeDetect -> (string)

                                      at  scene changes that the service auto-
                                      matically detects. This  improves  video
                                      quality  and  is  enabled by default. If
                                      this output uses QVBR, choose Transition
                                      detection   (TRANSITION_DETECTION)   for
                                      further video quality  improvement.  For
                                      more   information   about   QVBR,   see

                                   Slices -> (integer)
                                      Number  of  slices  per picture. Must be
                                      less than or equal to the number of mac-
                                      roblock  rows  for progressive pictures,
                                      and less than or equal to half the  num-
                                      ber  of  macroblock  rows for interlaced
                                      pictures.

                                   SlowPal -> (string)
                                      Ignore this setting  unless  your  input
                                      frame  rate  is  23.976 or 24 frames per
                                      second (fps). Enable slow PAL to  create
                                      a  25  fps  output. When you enable slow
                                      PAL,  MediaConvert  relabels  the  video
                                      frames  to  25  fps  and  resamples your
                                      audio to keep it synchronized  with  the
                                      video.  Note  that enabling this setting
                                      will slightly  reduce  the  duration  of
                                      your  video. Required settings: You must
                                      also set Framerate to 25. In  your  JSON
                                      job  specification,  set  (framerateCon-
                                      trol) to (SPECIFIED),  (framerateNumera-
                                      tor) to 25 and (framerateDenominator) to
                                      1.

                                   SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                                      Keep   the   default   value,    Enabled
                                      (ENABLED), to adjust quantization within
                                      each frame based on spatial variation of
                                      content complexity. When you enable this
                                      feature, the encoder uses fewer bits  on
                                      areas  that  can sustain more distortion
                                      with no  noticeable  visual  degradation
                                      and  uses  more  bits on areas where any
                                      small distortion will be noticeable. For
                                      example,  complex  textured  blocks  are
                                      encoded with fewer bits and smooth  tex-
                                      tured blocks are encoded with more bits.
                                      Enabling this feature will almost always
                                      improve   your   video   quality.  Note,
                                      though, that this feature  doesn't  take
                                      into  account  where the viewer's atten-
                                      tion is likely to  be.  If  viewers  are
                                      likely to be focusing their attention on

                                      Enabling this feature will almost always
                                      improve  your   video   quality.   Note,

                                      (FRAMEFORMER) to  do  motion-compensated
                                      interpolation.  FrameFormer  chooses the
                                      best conversion method frame  by  frame.
                                      Note  that  using  FrameFormer increases
                                      the transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                      nificant add-on cost.

                                   FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                      When  you use the API for transcode jobs
                                      that use frame rate conversion,  specify
                                      the  frame rate as a fraction. For exam-
                                      ple, 24000 /  1001  =  23.976  fps.  Use
                                      FramerateDenominator   to   specify  the
                                      denominator of this  fraction.  In  this
                                      example, use 1001 for the value of Fram-
                                      erateDenominator. When you use the  con-
                                      sole  for  transcode jobs that use frame
                                      rate conversion, provide the value as  a
                                      decimal  number  for  Framerate. In this
                                      example, specify 23.976.

                                   FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                      When you use the API for transcode  jobs
                                      that  use frame rate conversion, specify
                                      the frame rate as a fraction. For  exam-
                                      ple,  24000  /  1001  =  23.976 fps. Use
                                      FramerateNumerator to specify the numer-
                                      ator  of this fraction. In this example,
                                      use 24000 for the value of  FramerateNu-
                                      merator.  When  you  use the console for
                                      transcode jobs that use frame rate  con-
                                      version,  provide the value as a decimal
                                      number for Framerate. In  this  example,
                                      specify 23.976.

                                   GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                                      Specify  the  relative frequency of open
                                      to closed GOPs in this output. For exam-
                                      ple, if you want to allow four open GOPs
                                      and then require a closed GOP, set  this
                                      value  to 5. When you create a streaming
                                      output, we recommend that you  keep  the
                                      default value, 1, so that players start-
                                      ing mid-stream receive an IDR  frame  as
                                      quickly  as  possible.  Don't  set  this
                                      value to 0; that would break output seg-
                                      menting.

                                   GopSize -> (double)
                                      Specify  the interval between keyframes,
                                      in seconds or frames, for  this  output.
                                      Default:  12  Related settings: When you
                                      specify the GOP size in seconds, set GOP

                                      fied,  seconds  (SECONDS).  The  default
                                      value  for  GOP  mode control (GopSizeU-
                                      nits) is Frames (FRAMES).

                                   GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                                      Specify the units  for  GOP  size  (Gop-
                                      Size).  If  you  don't  specify  a value
                                      here, by default  the  encoder  measures
                                      GOP size in frames.

                                   HrdBufferInitialFillPercentage -> (integer)
                                      Percentage of  the  buffer  that  should
                                      initially  be filled (HRD buffer model).

                                   HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                                      Size of buffer  (HRD  buffer  model)  in
                                      bits.  For  example, enter five megabits
                                      as 5000000.

                                   InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                      Choose the scan line type for  the  out-
                                      put. Keep the default value, Progressive
                                      (PROGRESSIVE) to  create  a  progressive
                                      output,  regardless  of the scan type of
                                      your  input.   Use   Top   field   first
                                      (TOP_FIELD)  or Bottom field first (BOT-
                                      TOM_FIELD) to create  an  output  that's
                                      interlaced  with the same field polarity
                                      throughout.  Use  Follow,  default   top
                                      (FOLLOW_TOP_FIELD)  or  Follow,  default
                                      bottom (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to  produce
                                      outputs  with the same field polarity as
                                      the source. For jobs that have  multiple
                                      inputs,  the output field polarity might
                                      change over the course  of  the  output.
                                      Follow  behavior  depends  on  the input
                                      scan type. If the source is  interlaced,
                                      the  output  will be interlaced with the
                                      same polarity  as  the  source.  If  the
                                      source  is  progressive, the output will
                                      be  interlaced  with  top  field  bottom
                                      field  first,  depending on which of the
                                      Follow options you choose.

                                   IntraDcPrecision -> (string)
                                      Use Intra DC precision (Mpeg2IntraDcPre-
                                      cision)  to  set  quantization precision
                                      for intra-block DC coefficients. If  you
                                      choose  the value auto, the service will
                                      automatically select the precision based
                                      on the per-frame compression ratio.

                                   MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                      Maximum   bitrate  in  bits/second.  For
                                      example, enter five megabits per  second
                                      as 5000000.

                                   MinIInterval -> (integer)
                                      Use  this  setting  only  when  you also
                                      enable    Scene     change     detection
                                      (SceneChangeDetect). This setting deter-
                                      mines how the encoder manages the  spac-
                                      ing  between I-frames that it inserts as
                                      part of  the  I-frame  cadence  and  the
                                      I-frames   that  it  inserts  for  Scene
                                      change detection.  When  you  specify  a
                                      value  for  this  setting,  the  encoder
                                      determines    whether    to    skip    a
                                      cadence-driven  I-frame by the value you
                                      set. For  example,  if  you  set  Min  I
                                      interval   (minIInterval)  to  5  and  a
                                      cadence-driven I-frame would fall within
                                      5 frames of a scene-change I-frame, then
                                      the  encoder  skips  the  cadence-driven
                                      I-frame.  In this way, one GOP is shrunk
                                      slightly  and  one  GOP   is   stretched
                                      slightly.    When   the   cadence-driven
                                      I-frames   are    farther    from    the
                                      scene-change  I-frame than the value you
                                      set,  then  the   encoder   leaves   all
                                      I-frames in place and the GOPs surround-
                                      ing the scene change  are  smaller  than
                                      the usual cadence GOPs.

                                   (integer)
                                      Specify  the  number  of  B-frames  that
                                      MediaConvert   puts   between  reference
                                      frames in this output. Valid values  are
                                      whole numbers from 0 through 7. When you
                                      don't  specify  a  value,   MediaConvert
                                      defaults to 2.

                                   ParControl -> (string)

                                      in  the  console, choose any value other
                                      than Follow source. To specify a differ-

                                      cation,  choose  SPECIFIED.   When   you
                                      choose  SPECIFIED  for this setting, you
                                      must also specify values for the  parNu-
                                      merator and parDenominator settings.

                                   ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                      Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio
                                      (parControl) to SPECIFIED. On  the  con-
                                      sole,  this  corresponds  to  any  value

                                      For example, for D1/DV NTSC  widescreen,
                                      you  would  specify  the ratio 40:33. In

                                      Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio
                                      (parControl) to SPECIFIED. On  the  con-
                                      sole,  this  corresponds  to  any  value
                                      other than Follow source. When you spec-
                                      ify  an  output pixel aspect ratio (PAR)
                                      that is different from your input  video
                                      PAR, provide your output PAR as a ratio.
                                      For example, for D1/DV NTSC  widescreen,
                                      you  would  specify  the ratio 40:33. In
                                      this example, the value for parNumerator
                                      is 40.

                                   QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                      Optional.   Use   Quality  tuning  level
                                      (qualityTuningLevel) to choose  how  you
                                      want  to  trade  off  encoding speed for
                                      output video quality. The default behav-
                                      ior   is  faster,  lower  quality,  sin-
                                      gle-pass encoding.

                                   RateControlMode -> (string)
                                      Use  Rate  control  mode  (Mpeg2RateCon-
                                      trolMode) to specify whether the bitrate
                                      is variable (vbr) or constant (cbr).

                                   ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                                      Use this setting for interlaced outputs,
                                      when  your  output frame rate is half of
                                      your input frame rate.  In  this  situa-
                                      tion,   choose   Optimized   interlacing
                                      (INTERLACED_OPTIMIZE) to create a better
                                      quality interlaced output. In this case,
                                      each progressive frame  from  the  input
                                      corresponds  to  an  interlaced field in
                                      the  output.  Keep  the  default  value,
                                      Basic  interlacing (INTERLACED), for all
                                      other output  frame  rates.  With  basic
                                      interlacing,  MediaConvert  performs any
                                      frame rate  conversion  first  and  then
                                      interlaces  the  frames. When you choose
                                      Optimized interlacing and you  set  your
                                      output  frame rate to a value that isn't
                                      suitable  for   optimized   interlacing,
                                      MediaConvert automatically falls back to
                                      basic interlacing. Required settings: To
                                      use  optimized interlacing, you must set
                                      Telecine (telecine) to  None  (NONE)  or
                                      Soft  (SOFT).  You  can't  use optimized
                                      interlacing for hard  telecine  outputs.
                                      You must also set Interlace mode (inter-
                                      laceMode) to a value other than Progres-
                                      sive (PROGRESSIVE).

                                   SceneChangeDetect -> (string)
                                      Enable  this  setting to insert I-frames
                                      at scene changes that the service  auto-
                                      matically  detects.  This improves video
                                      quality and is enabled by default.

                                   SlowPal -> (string)
                                      Ignore this setting  unless  your  input
                                      frame  rate  is  23.976 or 24 frames per
                                      second (fps). Enable slow PAL to  create
                                      a  25  fps  output. When you enable slow
                                      PAL,  MediaConvert  relabels  the  video
                                      frames  to  25  fps  and  resamples your
                                      audio to keep it synchronized  with  the
                                      video.  Note  that enabling this setting
                                      will slightly  reduce  the  duration  of
                                      your  video. Required settings: You must
                                      also set Framerate to 25. In  your  JSON
                                      job  specification,  set  (framerateCon-
                                      trol) to (SPECIFIED),  (framerateNumera-
                                      tor) to 25 and (framerateDenominator) to
                                      1.

                                   Softness -> (integer)
                                      Ignore this setting unless you  need  to
                                      comply   with   a   specification   that
                                      requires a specific value. If you  don't
                                      have  a  specification  requirement,  we
                                      recommend that you adjust  the  softness
                                      of  your  output  by using a lower value
                                      for the setting Sharpness (sharpness) or
                                      by   enabling  a  noise  reducer  filter
                                      (noiseReducerFilter).    The    Softness
                                      (softness) setting specifies the quanti-
                                      zation matrices that the  encoder  uses.
                                      Keep  the  default  value, 0, to use the
                                      AWS Elemental default matrices. Choose a
                                      value  from  17  to  128  to  use planar
                                      interpolation. Increasing values from 17
                                      to 128 result in increasing reduction of
                                      high-frequency  data.  The   value   128
                                      results in the softest video.

                                   SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                                      Keep    the   default   value,   Enabled
                                      (ENABLED), to adjust quantization within
                                      each frame based on spatial variation of
                                      content complexity. When you enable this
                                      feature,  the encoder uses fewer bits on
                                      areas that can sustain  more  distortion
                                      with  no  noticeable  visual degradation
                                      and uses more bits on  areas  where  any
                                      small distortion will be noticeable. For
                                      example,  complex  textured  blocks  are
                                      encoded  with fewer bits and smooth tex-
                                      tured blocks are encoded with more bits.
                                      Enabling this feature will almost always
                                      improve  your   video   quality.   Note,
                                      though,  that  this feature doesn't take
                                      into account where the  viewer's  atten-
                                      tion  is  likely  to  be. If viewers are
                                      likely to be focusing their attention on
                                      a  part of the screen with a lot of com-

                                      on  your  content.  For homogeneous con-
                                      tent, such as cartoons and video  games,
                                      set  it to Low. For content with a wider
                                      variety of textures, set it to  High  or
                                      Higher.

                                   Syntax -> (string)
                                      Specify whether this output's video uses
                                      the D10 syntax. Keep the  default  value
                                      to not use the syntax. Related settings:
                                      When you choose D10 (D_10) for your  MXF
                                      profile  (profile),  you  must  also set
                                      this value to to D10 (D_10).

                                   Telecine -> (string)
                                      When you do frame rate  conversion  from
                                      23.976  frames per second (fps) to 29.97
                                      fps, and your output scan type is inter-
                                      laced, you can optionally enable hard or
                                      soft telecine to create a smoother  pic-
                                      ture.  Hard  telecine  (HARD) produces a
                                      29.97i output. Soft telecine (SOFT) pro-
                                      duces  an  output  with  a 23.976 output
                                      that signals to the video player  device
                                      to  do  the conversion during play back.
                                      When you keep the  default  value,  None
                                      (NONE),  MediaConvert  does  a  standard
                                      frame rate conversion to  29.97  without
                                      doing  anything  with the field polarity
                                      to create a smoother picture.

                                   TemporalAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                                      Keep   the   default   value,    Enabled
                                      (ENABLED), to adjust quantization within

                                      of  content  complexity. When you enable
                                      this feature,  the  encoder  uses  fewer
                                      bits  on  areas of the frame that aren't
                                      moving and uses  more  bits  on  complex
                                      objects  with  sharp  edges  that move a
                                      lot. For example, this feature  improves

                                      using  drop  duplicate  (DUPLICATE_DROP)
                                      for numerically simple conversions, such
                                      as  60  fps  to  30 fps. For numerically
                                      complex conversions, you can use  inter-
                                      polate  (INTERPOLATE)  to avoid stutter.
                                      This results in a  smooth  picture,  but
                                      might  introduce undesirable video arti-

                                      (FRAMEFORMER) to  do  motion-compensated
                                      interpolation.  FrameFormer  chooses the
                                      best conversion method frame  by  frame.
                                      Note  that  using  FrameFormer increases
                                      the transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                      nificant add-on cost.

                                   FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                      When  you use the API for transcode jobs
                                      that use frame rate conversion,  specify
                                      the  frame rate as a fraction. For exam-
                                      ple, 24000 /  1001  =  23.976  fps.  Use
                                      FramerateDenominator   to   specify  the
                                      denominator of this  fraction.  In  this
                                      example, use 1001 for the value of Fram-
                                      erateDenominator. When you use the  con-
                                      sole  for  transcode jobs that use frame
                                      rate conversion, provide the value as  a
                                      decimal  number  for  Framerate. In this
                                      example, specify 23.976.

                                   FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                      When you use the API for transcode  jobs
                                      that  use frame rate conversion, specify
                                      the frame rate as a fraction. For  exam-
                                      ple,  24000  /  1001  =  23.976 fps. Use
                                      FramerateNumerator to specify the numer-
                                      ator  of this fraction. In this example,
                                      use 24000 for the value of  FramerateNu-
                                      merator.  When  you  use the console for
                                      transcode jobs that use frame rate  con-
                                      version,  provide the value as a decimal
                                      number for Framerate. In  this  example,
                                      specify 23.976.

                                   InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                      Choose  the  scan line type for the out-
                                      put. Keep the default value, Progressive
                                      (PROGRESSIVE)  to  create  a progressive
                                      output, regardless of the scan  type  of
                                      your   input.   Use   Top   field  first
                                      (TOP_FIELD) or Bottom field first  (BOT-
                                      TOM_FIELD)  to  create  an output that's
                                      interlaced with the same field  polarity
                                      throughout.   Use  Follow,  default  top
                                      (FOLLOW_TOP_FIELD)  or  Follow,  default
                                      bottom  (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to produce
                                      outputs with the same field polarity  as
                                      the  source. For jobs that have multiple
                                      inputs, the output field polarity  might
                                      change  over  the  course of the output.
                                      Follow behavior  depends  on  the  input
                                      scan  type. If the source is interlaced,
                                      the output will be interlaced  with  the
                                      same  polarity  as  the  source.  If the
                                      source is progressive, the  output  will
                                      be  interlaced  with  top  field  bottom
                                      field first, depending on which  of  the
                                      Follow options you choose.

                                      ify  an  output pixel aspect ratio (PAR)
                                      that is different from your input  video
                                      PAR, provide your output PAR as a ratio.
                                      For example, for D1/DV NTSC  widescreen,
                                      you  would  specify  the ratio 40:33. In
                                      this example, the value for parNumerator
                                      is 40.

                                   ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                                      Use this setting for interlaced outputs,
                                      when your output frame rate is  half  of
                                      your  input  frame  rate. In this situa-
                                      tion,   choose   Optimized   interlacing
                                      (INTERLACED_OPTIMIZE) to create a better
                                      quality interlaced output. In this case,
                                      each  progressive  frame  from the input
                                      corresponds to an  interlaced  field  in
                                      the  output.  Keep  the  default  value,
                                      Basic interlacing (INTERLACED), for  all
                                      other  output  frame  rates.  With basic
                                      interlacing, MediaConvert  performs  any
                                      frame  rate  conversion  first  and then
                                      interlaces the frames. When  you  choose
                                      Optimized  interlacing  and you set your
                                      output frame rate to a value that  isn't
                                      suitable   for   optimized  interlacing,
                                      MediaConvert automatically falls back to
                                      basic interlacing. Required settings: To
                                      use optimized interlacing, you must  set
                                      Telecine  (telecine)  to  None (NONE) or
                                      Soft (SOFT).  You  can't  use  optimized
                                      interlacing  for  hard telecine outputs.
                                      You must also set Interlace mode (inter-
                                      laceMode) to a value other than Progres-
                                      sive (PROGRESSIVE).

                                   SlowPal -> (string)
                                      Ignore this setting  unless  your  input
                                      frame  rate  is  23.976 or 24 frames per
                                      second (fps). Enable slow PAL to  create
                                      a  25  fps  output. When you enable slow
                                      PAL,  MediaConvert  relabels  the  video
                                      frames  to  25  fps  and  resamples your
                                      audio to keep it synchronized  with  the
                                      video.  Note  that enabling this setting
                                      will slightly  reduce  the  duration  of
                                      your  video. Required settings: You must
                                      also set Framerate to 25. In  your  JSON
                                      job  specification,  set  (framerateCon-
                                      trol) to (SPECIFIED),  (framerateNumera-
                                      tor) to 25 and (framerateDenominator) to
                                      1.

                                   Telecine -> (string)
                                      When you do frame rate  conversion  from
                                      23.976  frames per second (fps) to 29.97
                                      fps, and your output scan type is inter-
                                      laced,  you  can  optionally enable hard
                                      telecine (HARD)  to  create  a  smoother
                                      picture.   When  you  keep  the  default
                                      value, None (NONE), MediaConvert does  a
                                      standard  frame rate conversion to 29.97
                                      without doing anything  with  the  field
                                      polarity to create a smoother picture.

                               Vc3Settings -> (structure)
                                   Required   when   you   set  (Codec)  under
                                   (VideoDescription)>(CodecSettings)  to  the
                                   value VC3

                                   FramerateControl -> (string)
                                      If  you  are  using the console, use the
                                      Framerate setting to specify  the  frame
                                      rate  for  this  output.  If you want to
                                      keep the same frame rate  as  the  input
                                      video, choose Follow source. If you want
                                      to do frame rate  conversion,  choose  a
                                      frame  rate  from  the  dropdown list or
                                      choose Custom. The framerates  shown  in
                                      the dropdown list are decimal approxima-
                                      tions of fractions. If you  choose  Cus-
                                      tom,  specify your frame rate as a frac-

                                      without the console,  use  FramerateCon-
                                      trol  to specify which value the service
                                      uses for the frame rate for this output.
                                      Choose   INITIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE  if  you
                                      want the service to use the  frame  rate
                                      from  the input. Choose SPECIFIED if you
                                      want the service to use the  frame  rate
                                      you specify in the settings FramerateNu-
                                      merator and FramerateDenominator.

                                   FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                      Choose the method that you  want  Media-
                                      Convert   to   use  when  increasing  or
                                      decreasing the frame rate. We  recommend
                                      using  drop  duplicate  (DUPLICATE_DROP)
                                      for numerically simple conversions, such
                                      as  60  fps  to  30 fps. For numerically
                                      complex conversions, you can use  inter-
                                      polate  (INTERPOLATE)  to avoid stutter.
                                      This results in a  smooth  picture,  but
                                      might  introduce undesirable video arti-
                                      facts. For complex  frame  rate  conver-
                                      sions,  especially  if your source video
                                      has  already  been  converted  from  its
                                      original    cadence,   use   FrameFormer
                                      (FRAMEFORMER) to  do  motion-compensated
                                      interpolation.  FrameFormer  chooses the
                                      best conversion method frame  by  frame.
                                      Note  that  using  FrameFormer increases
                                      the transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                      nificant add-on cost.

                                   FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                      When  you use the API for transcode jobs
                                      that use frame rate conversion,  specify
                                      the  frame rate as a fraction. For exam-
                                      ple, 24000 /  1001  =  23.976  fps.  Use
                                      FramerateDenominator   to   specify  the
                                      denominator of this  fraction.  In  this
                                      example, use 1001 for the value of Fram-
                                      erateDenominator. When you use the  con-
                                      sole  for  transcode jobs that use frame
                                      rate conversion, provide the value as  a
                                      decimal  number  for  Framerate. In this
                                      example, specify 23.976.

                                   FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                      When you use the API for transcode  jobs
                                      that  use frame rate conversion, specify
                                      the frame rate as a fraction. For  exam-
                                      ple,  24000  /  1001  =  23.976 fps. Use
                                      FramerateNumerator to specify the numer-
                                      ator  of this fraction. In this example,
                                      use 24000 for the value of  FramerateNu-
                                      merator.  When  you  use the console for
                                      transcode jobs that use frame rate  con-
                                      version,  provide the value as a decimal
                                      number for Framerate. In  this  example,
                                      specify 23.976.

                                   InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                      Optional.  Choose the scan line type for
                                      this output.  If  you  don't  specify  a
                                      value,  MediaConvert  will create a pro-
                                      gressive output.

                                   ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                                      Use this setting for interlaced outputs,
                                      when  your  output frame rate is half of
                                      your input frame rate.  In  this  situa-
                                      tion,   choose   Optimized   interlacing
                                      (INTERLACED_OPTIMIZE) to create a better
                                      quality interlaced output. In this case,
                                      each progressive frame  from  the  input
                                      corresponds  to  an  interlaced field in
                                      the  output.  Keep  the  default  value,
                                      Basic  interlacing (INTERLACED), for all
                                      other output  frame  rates.  With  basic
                                      interlacing,  MediaConvert  performs any
                                      frame rate  conversion  first  and  then
                                      interlaces  the  frames. When you choose
                                      Optimized interlacing and you  set  your
                                      output  frame rate to a value that isn't
                                      suitable  for   optimized   interlacing,
                                      MediaConvert automatically falls back to
                                      basic interlacing. Required settings: To
                                      use  optimized interlacing, you must set
                                      Telecine (telecine) to  None  (NONE)  or

                                      frames  and  resampling your audio. Note
                                      that enabling this setting will slightly
                                      reduce   the  duration  of  your  video.

                                      and  width),   determine   your   output
                                      bitrate.  For  example,  say  that  your
                                      video resolution is 1920x1080  and  your
                                      framerate   is  29.97.  Then  Class  145
                                      (CLASS_145) gives you an output  with  a
                                      bitrate  of  approximately  145 Mbps and
                                      Class 220 (CLASS_220) gives you and out-

                                      Mbps. VC3 class also specifies the color
                                      bit depth of your output.

                                   FramerateControl -> (string)
                                      If  you  are  using the console, use the
                                      Framerate setting to specify  the  frame
                                      rate  for  this  output.  If you want to

                                      uses for the frame rate for this output.
                                      Choose   INITIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE  if  you
                                      want the service to use the  frame  rate
                                      from  the input. Choose SPECIFIED if you
                                      want the service to use the  frame  rate
                                      you specify in the settings FramerateNu-

                                   FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                      Choose the method that you  want  Media-
                                      Convert   to   use  when  increasing  or
                                      decreasing the frame rate. We  recommend
                                      using  drop  duplicate  (DUPLICATE_DROP)
                                      for numerically simple conversions, such
                                      as  60  fps  to  30 fps. For numerically
                                      complex conversions, you can use  inter-
                                      polate  (INTERPOLATE)  to avoid stutter.
                                      This results in a  smooth  picture,  but
                                      might  introduce undesirable video arti-

                                      sions,  especially  if your source video
                                      has  already  been  converted  from  its
                                      original    cadence,   use   FrameFormer
                                      (FRAMEFORMER) to  do  motion-compensated
                                      interpolation.  FrameFormer  chooses the
                                      best conversion method frame  by  frame.
                                      Note  that  using  FrameFormer increases
                                      the transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                      nificant add-on cost.

                                   FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                      When  you use the API for transcode jobs
                                      that use frame rate conversion,  specify
                                      the  frame rate as a fraction. For exam-
                                      ple, 24000 /  1001  =  23.976  fps.  Use
                                      FramerateDenominator   to   specify  the
                                      denominator of this  fraction.  In  this
                                      example, use 1001 for the value of Fram-
                                      erateDenominator. When you use the  con-
                                      sole  for  transcode jobs that use frame
                                      rate conversion, provide the value as  a
                                      decimal  number  for  Framerate. In this
                                      example, specify 23.976.

                                   FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                      When you use the API for transcode  jobs
                                      that  use frame rate conversion, specify
                                      the frame rate as a fraction. For  exam-
                                      ple,  24000  /  1001  =  23.976 fps. Use
                                      FramerateNumerator to specify the numer-
                                      ator  of this fraction. In this example,
                                      use 24000 for the value of  FramerateNu-
                                      merator.  When  you  use the console for
                                      transcode jobs that use frame rate  con-
                                      version,  provide the value as a decimal
                                      number for Framerate. In  this  example,
                                      specify 23.976.

                                   GopSize -> (double)
                                      GOP   Length   (keyframe   interval)  in
                                      frames. Must be greater than zero.

                                   HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                                      Optional. Size  of  buffer  (HRD  buffer
                                      model)  in bits. For example, enter five
                                      megabits as 5000000.

                                   MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                      Ignore this setting unless you set qual-
                                      ityTuningLevel  to MULTI_PASS. Optional.
                                      Specify the maximum bitrate in bits/sec-
                                      ond.  For  example,  enter five megabits
                                      per  second  as  5000000.  The   default
                                      behavior  uses  twice the target bitrate
                                      as the maximum bitrate.

                                   ParControl -> (string)
                                      Optional. Specify how the service deter-
                                      mines  the  pixel aspect ratio (PAR) for
                                      this output. The default behavior,  Fol-
                                      low   source   (INITIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE),
                                      uses the PAR from your input  video  for
                                      your  output. To specify a different PAR
                                      in the console, choose any  value  other
                                      than Follow source. To specify a differ-
                                      ent PAR by editing the JSON job specifi-
                                      cation,   choose   SPECIFIED.  When  you
                                      choose SPECIFIED for this  setting,  you
                                      must  also specify values for the parNu-
                                      merator and parDenominator settings.

                                   ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                      Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio
                                      (parControl)  to  SPECIFIED. On the con-
                                      sole,  this  corresponds  to  any  value
                                      other than Follow source. When you spec-
                                      ify an output pixel aspect  ratio  (PAR)
                                      that  is different from your input video
                                      PAR, provide your output PAR as a ratio.
                                      For  example, for D1/DV NTSC widescreen,
                                      you would specify the  ratio  40:33.  In
                                      this example, the value for parDenomina-

                                      Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio
                                      (parControl)  to  SPECIFIED. On the con-
                                      sole,  this  corresponds  to  any  value
                                      other than Follow source. When you spec-
                                      ify an output pixel aspect  ratio  (PAR)
                                      that  is different from your input video
                                      PAR, provide your output PAR as a ratio.
                                      For  example, for D1/DV NTSC widescreen,
                                      you would specify the  ratio  40:33.  In
                                      this example, the value for parNumerator
                                      is 40.

                                   QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                      Optional.  Use  Quality   tuning   level
                                      (qualityTuningLevel)  to  choose how you
                                      want to trade  off  encoding  speed  for
                                      output video quality. The default behav-
                                      ior is faster, lower quality, multi-pass
                                      encoding.

                                   RateControlMode -> (string)
                                      With the VP8 codec, you can use only the
                                      variable  bitrate  (VBR)  rate   control
                                      mode.

                               Vp9Settings -> (structure)
                                   Required   when   you   set  (Codec)  under
                                   (VideoDescription)>(CodecSettings)  to  the
                                   value VP9.

                                   Bitrate -> (integer)
                                      Target bitrate in bits/second. For exam-
                                      ple, enter five megabits per  second  as
                                      5000000.

                                   FramerateControl -> (string)
                                      If  you  are  using the console, use the
                                      Framerate setting to specify  the  frame
                                      rate  for  this  output.  If you want to
                                      keep the same frame rate  as  the  input
                                      video, choose Follow source. If you want
                                      to do frame rate  conversion,  choose  a
                                      frame  rate  from  the  dropdown list or
                                      choose Custom. The framerates  shown  in
                                      the dropdown list are decimal approxima-
                                      tions of fractions. If you  choose  Cus-
                                      tom,  specify your frame rate as a frac-
                                      tion. If you are creating your transcod-
                                      ing  job  specification  as  a JSON file
                                      without the console,  use  FramerateCon-
                                      trol  to specify which value the service
                                      uses for the frame rate for this output.
                                      Choose   INITIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE  if  you
                                      want the service to use the  frame  rate
                                      from  the input. Choose SPECIFIED if you
                                      want the service to use the  frame  rate
                                      you specify in the settings FramerateNu-
                                      merator and FramerateDenominator.

                                   FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                      Choose the method that you  want  Media-
                                      Convert   to   use  when  increasing  or
                                      decreasing the frame rate. We  recommend
                                      using  drop  duplicate  (DUPLICATE_DROP)
                                      for numerically simple conversions, such
                                      as  60  fps  to  30 fps. For numerically
                                      complex conversions, you can use  inter-
                                      polate  (INTERPOLATE)  to avoid stutter.
                                      This results in a  smooth  picture,  but
                                      might  introduce undesirable video arti-
                                      facts. For complex  frame  rate  conver-
                                      sions,  especially  if your source video
                                      has  already  been  converted  from  its
                                      original    cadence,   use   FrameFormer
                                      (FRAMEFORMER) to  do  motion-compensated
                                      interpolation.  FrameFormer  chooses the
                                      best conversion method frame  by  frame.
                                      Note  that  using  FrameFormer increases
                                      the transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                      nificant add-on cost.

                                   FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                      When  you use the API for transcode jobs
                                      that use frame rate conversion,  specify
                                      the  frame rate as a fraction. For exam-
                                      ple, 24000 /  1001  =  23.976  fps.  Use
                                      FramerateDenominator   to   specify  the
                                      denominator of this  fraction.  In  this
                                      example, use 1001 for the value of Fram-
                                      erateDenominator. When you use the  con-
                                      sole  for  transcode jobs that use frame
                                      rate conversion, provide the value as  a
                                      decimal  number  for  Framerate. In this
                                      example, specify 23.976.

                                   FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                      When you use the API for transcode  jobs
                                      that  use frame rate conversion, specify
                                      the frame rate as a fraction. For  exam-
                                      ple,  24000  /  1001  =  23.976 fps. Use
                                      FramerateNumerator to specify the numer-
                                      ator  of this fraction. In this example,
                                      use 24000 for the value of  FramerateNu-
                                      merator.  When  you  use the console for
                                      transcode jobs that use frame rate  con-
                                      version,  provide the value as a decimal
                                      number for Framerate. In  this  example,
                                      specify 23.976.

                                   GopSize -> (double)
                                      GOP   Length   (keyframe   interval)  in
                                      frames. Must be greater than zero.

                                   HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                                      Size of buffer  (HRD  buffer  model)  in
                                      bits.  For  example, enter five megabits
                                      as 5000000.

                                   MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                      Ignore this setting unless you set qual-
                                      ityTuningLevel  to MULTI_PASS. Optional.
                                      Specify the maximum bitrate in bits/sec-
                                      ond.  For  example,  enter five megabits
                                      per  second  as  5000000.  The   default
                                      behavior  uses  twice the target bitrate
                                      as the maximum bitrate.

                                   ParControl -> (string)
                                      Optional. Specify how the service deter-
                                      mines  the  pixel  aspect ratio for this
                                      output. The default behavior is  to  use
                                      the  same  pixel  aspect  ratio  as your
                                      input video.

                                   ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                      Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio
                                      (parControl)  to  SPECIFIED. On the con-
                                      sole,  this  corresponds  to  any  value
                                      other than Follow source. When you spec-
                                      ify an output pixel aspect  ratio  (PAR)
                                      that  is different from your input video
                                      PAR, provide your output PAR as a ratio.
                                      For  example, for D1/DV NTSC widescreen,
                                      you would specify the  ratio  40:33.  In
                                      this example, the value for parDenomina-
                                      tor is 33.

                                   ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                      Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio
                                      (parControl)  to  SPECIFIED. On the con-
                                      sole,  this  corresponds  to  any  value

                                   QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                      Optional.  Use  Quality   tuning   level
                                      (qualityTuningLevel)  to  choose how you
                                      want to trade  off  encoding  speed  for
                                      output video quality. The default behav-

                                   FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                      Choose the method that you  want  Media-
                                      Convert   to   use  when  increasing  or
                                      decreasing the frame rate. We  recommend
                                      using  drop  duplicate  (DUPLICATE_DROP)
                                      for numerically simple conversions, such
                                      as  60  fps  to  30 fps. For numerically
                                      complex conversions, you can use  inter-
                                      polate  (INTERPOLATE)  to avoid stutter.
                                      This results in a  smooth  picture,  but
                                      might  introduce undesirable video arti-

                                      sions,  especially  if your source video

                                      original    cadence,   use   FrameFormer
                                      (FRAMEFORMER) to  do  motion-compensated
                                      interpolation.  FrameFormer  chooses the
                                      best conversion method frame  by  frame.
                                      Note  that  using  FrameFormer increases
                                      the transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                      nificant add-on cost.

                                   FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                      When  you use the API for transcode jobs
                                      that use frame rate conversion,  specify
                                      the  frame rate as a fraction. For exam-
                                      ple, 24000 /  1001  =  23.976  fps.  Use
                                      FramerateDenominator   to   specify  the
                                      denominator of this  fraction.  In  this
                                      example, use 1001 for the value of Fram-
                                      erateDenominator. When you use the  con-
                                      sole  for  transcode jobs that use frame
                                      rate conversion, provide the value as  a
                                      decimal  number  for Frame rate. In this
                                      example, specify 23.976.

                                   FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                      When you use the API for transcode  jobs
                                      that  use frame rate conversion, specify
                                      the frame rate as a fraction. For  exam-
                                      ple,  24000  /  1001  =  23.976 fps. Use
                                      FramerateNumerator to specify the numer-
                                      ator  of this fraction. In this example,
                                      use 24000 for the value of  FramerateNu-
                                      merator.  When  you  use the console for
                                      transcode jobs that use frame rate  con-
                                      version,  provide the value as a decimal
                                      number for Framerate. In  this  example,
                                      specify 23.976.

                                   SlowPal -> (string)
                                      Ignore  this  setting  unless your input

                                      second  (fps). Enable slow PAL to create
                                      a 25 fps output by relabeling the  video
                                      frames  and  resampling your audio. Note
                                      that enabling this setting will slightly
                                      reduce   the  duration  of  your  video.
                                      Related  settings:  You  must  also  set
                                      Frame rate to 25. In your JSON job spec-

                                   Softness -> (integer)
                                      Ignore this setting  unless  your  down-

                                      setting   specifies   the   quantization
                                      matrices that the encoder uses. Keep the
                                      default value, 0, for flat quantization.
                                      Choose  the  value  1  or  16 to use the

                                      from 17  to  128  result  in  increasing
                                      reduction  of  high-frequency  data. The
                                      value 128 results in the softest  video.

                                   SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                                      The  best way to set up adaptive quanti-
                                      zation is to  keep  the  default  value,
                                      Auto  (AUTO),  for  the setting Adaptive

                                      For   this  setting,  keep  the  default
                                      value,  Enabled  (ENABLED),  to   adjust
                                      quantization  within each frame based on

                                      When   you   enable  this  feature,  the
                                      encoder uses fewer bits  on  areas  that
                                      can  sustain  more  distortion  with  no
                                      noticeable visual degradation  and  uses
                                      more  bits on areas where any small dis-
                                      tortion will be noticeable. For example,
                                      complex textured blocks are encoded with
                                      fewer bits and  smooth  textured  blocks
                                      are  encoded  with  more  bits. Enabling
                                      this feature will almost always  improve
                                      your  video  quality. Note, though, that

                                          The  best  way  to  set  up adaptive
                                          quantization is to keep the  default
                                          value,  Auto (AUTO), for the setting
                                          Adaptive quantization (XavcAdaptive-
                                          Quantization). When you do so, Medi-
                                          aConvert automatically  applies  the
                                          best  types of quantization for your
                                          video content. Include this  setting
                                          in  your JSON job specification only
                                          when  you  choose  to   change   the
                                          default value for Adaptive quantiza-

                                          I-frame  pop  appears  as  a  visual
                                          flicker  that  can  arise  when  the
                                          encoder saves bits by  copying  some
                                          macroblocks many times from frame to
                                          frame, and then  refreshes  them  at
                                          the  I-frame.  When  you enable this
                                          setting, the encoder  updates  these
                                          macroblocks  slightly  more often to
                                          smooth out the flicker. This setting

                                          Specify  whether  the  encoder  uses
                                          B-frames  as  reference  frames  for
                                          other  pictures  in  the  same  GOP.
                                          Choose Allow (ENABLED) to allow  the
                                          encoder to use B-frames as reference
                                          frames.  Choose  Don't  allow  (DIS-
                                          ABLED)  to  prevent the encoder from
                                          using B-frames as reference  frames.

                                      GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                                          Frequency of closed GOPs. In stream-
                                          ing applications, it is  recommended
                                          that  this  be set to 1 so a decoder
                                          joining mid-stream will  receive  an
                                          IDR  frame  as  quickly as possible.
                                          Setting this value to 0  will  break

                                      HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                                          Specify  the size of the buffer that
                                          MediaConvert uses in the HRD  buffer
                                          model  for this output. Specify this
                                          value in bits;  for  example,  enter
                                          five  megabits  as 5000000. When you
                                          don't set this value, or you set  it
                                          to zero, MediaConvert calculates the
                                          default by doubling the  bitrate  of
                                          this output point.

                                          gressive  (PROGRESSIVE)  to create a
                                          progressive  output,  regardless  of
                                          the scan type of your input. Use Top

                                          field first (BOTTOM_FIELD) to create
                                          an output that's interlaced with the
                                          same  field polarity throughout. Use

                                          polarity as  the  source.  For  jobs
                                          that  have multiple inputs, the out-
                                          put field polarity might change over

                                          type.  If  the source is interlaced,
                                          the output will be  interlaced  with
                                          the  same polarity as the source. If
                                          the source is progressive, the  out-
                                          put  will  be  interlaced  with  top

                               Y -> (integer)
                                   The distance, in pixels, between  the  rec-
                                   tangle and the top edge of the video frame.
                                   Specify only even numbers.

                            DropFrameTimecode -> (string)
                               Applies only to 29.97 fps  outputs.  When  this
                               feature   is  enabled,  the  service  will  use
                               drop-frame timecode on outputs. If  it  is  not
                               possible to use drop-frame timecode, the system
                               will fall back to non-drop-frame. This  setting
                               is  enabled  by default when Timecode insertion
                               (TimecodeInsertion) is enabled.

                            FixedAfd -> (integer)
                               Applies only if you set  AFD  Signaling(AfdSig-
                               naling)  to Fixed (FIXED). Use Fixed (FixedAfd)
                               to specify a four-bit AFD value which the  ser-
                               vice  will  write  on  all frames of this video
                               output.

                            Height -> (integer)
                               Use the Height (Height) setting to  define  the
                               video  resolution height for this output. Spec-
                               ify in pixels. If you  don't  provide  a  value
                               here, the service will use the input height.

                            Position -> (structure)
                               Use  Selection  placement  (position) to define
                               the video area in your output frame.  The  area
                               outside  of the rectangle that you specify here
                               is black.

                               Height -> (integer)
                                   Height of rectangle in pixels. Specify only
                                   even numbers.

                               Width -> (integer)
                                   Width  of rectangle in pixels. Specify only
                                   even numbers.

                               X -> (integer)
                                   The distance, in pixels, between  the  rec-
                                   tangle  and  the  left  edge  of  the video
                                   frame. Specify only even numbers.

                               Y -> (integer)
                                   The distance, in pixels, between  the  rec-
                                   tangle and the top edge of the video frame.
                                   Specify only even numbers.

                            RespondToAfd -> (string)
                               Use Respond to AFD  (RespondToAfd)  to  specify
                               how  the  service  changes  the video itself in
                               response to AFD values in the input.  *  Choose
                               Respond to clip the input video frame according
                               to the AFD value, input display  aspect  ratio,
                               and  output  display  aspect  ratio.  *  Choose
                               Passthrough to include the input AFD values. Do
                               not  choose  this  when  AfdSignaling is set to
                               (NONE).  A  preferred  implementation  of  this
                               workflow  is  to set RespondToAfd to (NONE) and
                               set AfdSignaling to (AUTO). *  Choose  None  to
                               remove all input AFD values from this output.

                            ScalingBehavior -> (string)
                               Specify  how  the  service handles outputs that
                               have a different aspect ratio  from  the  input
                               aspect   ratio.   Choose   Stretch   to  output
                               (STRETCH_TO_OUTPUT) to have the service stretch
                               your  video  image  to  fit.  Keep  the setting
                               Default (DEFAULT) to have the service letterbox
                               your  video instead. This setting overrides any
                               value that you specify for the  setting  Selec-
                               tion placement (position) in this output.

                            Sharpness -> (integer)
                               Use  Sharpness  (Sharpness)  setting to specify
                               the strength  of  anti-aliasing.  This  setting
                               changes the width of the anti-alias filter ker-
                               nel used for scaling. Sharpness only applies if
                               your  output  resolution is different from your
                               input resolution. 0 is the softest setting, 100
                               the  sharpest, and 50 recommended for most con-
                               tent.

                            TimecodeInsertion -> (string)
                               Applies only to H.264, H.265, MPEG2, and ProRes
                               outputs.  Only  enable  Timecode insertion when
                               the input frame rate is identical to the output
                               frame  rate.  To include timecodes in this out-
                               put, set Timecode  insertion  (VideoTimecodeIn-
                               sertion)  to PIC_TIMING_SEI. To leave them out,
                               set it to DISABLED. Default is  DISABLED.  When
                               the  service inserts timecodes in an output, by
                               default, it uses any  embedded  timecodes  from
                               the  input.  If  none  are present, the service
                               will set the  timecode  for  the  first  output
                               frame to zero. To change this default behavior,
                               adjust the settings under  Timecode  configura-
                               tion  (TimecodeConfig).  In  the console, these
                               settings are located under Job > Job settings >
                               Timecode  configuration. Note - Timecode source
                               under input settings (InputTimecodeSource) does
                               not  affect  the timecodes that are inserted in
                               the output. Source under Job settings  >  Time-

                               features  at  each  output  individually. These
                               features are disabled by default.

                               ColorCorrector -> (structure)
                                   Use these settings  to  convert  the  color
                                   space  or  to modify properties such as hue

                                      this output. To create a full range out-
                                      put, you must start with  a  full  range
                                      YUV  input  and  keep the default value,
                                      None (NONE). To create a  limited  range
                                      output  from  a full range input, choose
                                      Limited  range  (LIMITED_RANGE_SQUEEZE).
                                      With  RGB  inputs, your output is always

                                      in a way that depends  on  the  output's
                                      bit  depth:  8-bit  outputs contain only
                                      values from 16 through  235  and  10-bit
                                      outputs  contain  only  values  from  64
                                      through 940. With this conversion, Medi-
                                      aConvert  also  changes the output meta-
                                      data to note the limited range.

                                        gressive. It will only  convert  those
                                        that  are tagged as some other type. -

                                        already  tagged  as  progressive. Turn
                                        Force mode on only if there is a  good

                                        frames as progressive  when  they  are
                                        not progressive. Do not turn on other-
                                        wise;  processing  frames   that   are

                                          ducer) to Temporal  (TEMPORAL),  the
                                          sharpness of your output is reduced.
                                          You can optionally use Post temporal
                                          sharpening  (PostTemporalSharpening)
                                          to apply sharpening to the edges  of
                                          your  output.  The default behavior,
                                          Auto (AUTO), allows  the  transcoder
                                          to determine whether to apply sharp-
                                          ening, depending on your input  type

                                          leave  blank,  to apply a low amount
                                          of  sharpening.  Set  Post  temporal

                                          Optional. Ignore this setting unless
                                          Nagra support directs you to specify
                                          a value. When you  don't  specify  a
                                          value   here,   the  Nagra  NexGuard

                               TimecodeBurnin -> (structure)
                                   Settings for burning  the  output  timecode
                                   and specified prefix into the output.

                                   FontSize -> (integer)
                                      Use Font Size (FontSize) to set the font
                                      size of any  burned-in  timecode.  Valid
                                      values are 10, 16, 32, 48.

                                   Position -> (string)
                                      Use   Position  (Position)  under  under
                                      Timecode  burn-in  (TimecodeBurnIn)   to
                                      specify the location the burned-in time-
                                      code on output video.

                                   Prefix -> (string)
                                      Use Prefix (Prefix) to place ASCII char-
                                      acters  before  any  burned-in timecode.
                                      For example,  a  prefix  of  "EZ-"  will
                                      result in the timecode "EZ-00:00:00:00".
                                      Provide either the characters themselves
                                      or  the ASCII code equivalents. The sup-
                                      ported  range  of  characters  is   0x20
                                      through  0x7e.  This  includes  letters,
                                      numbers, and all special characters rep-
                                      resented on a standard English keyboard.

                            Width -> (integer)
                               Use Width (Width) to define the  video  resolu-
                               tion  width, in pixels, for this output. If you
                               don't provide a value here,  the  service  will
                               use the input width.

          TimecodeConfig -> (structure)
              These   settings  control  how  the  service  handles  timecodes
              throughout the job. These settings don't affect input  clipping.

              Anchor -> (string)
                 If you use an editing platform that relies on an anchor time-
                 code, use Anchor Timecode (Anchor) to specify a timecode that
                 will  match  the input video frame to the output video frame.
                 Use  24-hour  format  with  frame  number,  (HH:MM:SS:FF)  or
                 (HH:MM:SS;FF).  This  setting  ignores frame rate conversion.
                 System behavior for Anchor Timecode varies depending on  your
                 setting  for Source (TimecodeSource). * If Source (TimecodeS-
                 ource) is set to Specified Start (SPECIFIEDSTART), the  first
                 input frame is the specified value in Start Timecode (Start).
                 Anchor Timecode (Anchor) and Start Timecode (Start) are  used
                 calculate  output  timecode.  * If Source (TimecodeSource) is
                 set to Start at 0 (ZEROBASED) the first frame is 00:00:00:00.
                 *  If  Source (TimecodeSource) is set to Embedded (EMBEDDED),
                 the first frame is the timecode  value  on  the  first  input
                 frame of the input.

              Source -> (string)
                 Use  Source (TimecodeSource) to set how timecodes are handled
                 within this job. To make sure that your  video,  audio,  cap-
                 tions,  and markers are synchronized and that time-based fea-
                 tures, such as image inserter,  work  correctly,  choose  the
                 Timecode  source  option  that matches your assets. All time-
                 codes  are  in   a   24-hour   format   with   frame   number
                 (HH:MM:SS:FF).  * Embedded (EMBEDDED) - Use the timecode that
                 is in the input video. If no  embedded  timecode  is  in  the
                 source,  the service will use Start at 0 (ZEROBASED) instead.
                 * Start at 0 (ZEROBASED) - Set the timecode  of  the  initial
                 frame  to  00:00:00:00.  * Specified Start (SPECIFIEDSTART) -
                 Set the timecode of the initial frame to a value  other  than
                 zero. You use Start timecode (Start) to provide this value.

              Start -> (string)
                 Only  use  when  you set Source (TimecodeSource) to Specified
                 start (SPECIFIEDSTART). Use Start timecode (Start) to specify
                 the  timecode  for the initial frame. Use 24-hour format with
                 frame number, (HH:MM:SS:FF) or (HH:MM:SS;FF).

              TimestampOffset -> (string)
                 Only applies to outputs that support program-date-time stamp.
                 Use Timestamp offset (TimestampOffset) to overwrite the time-
                 code date without affecting the time and frame  number.  Pro-
                 vide  the new date as a string in the format "yyyy-mm-dd". To
                 use Time stamp offset,  you  must  also  enable  Insert  pro-
                 gram-date-time  (InsertProgramDateTime)  in  the  output set-
                 tings. For example, if the date part  of  your  timecodes  is
                 2002-1-25  and  you  want to change it to one year later, set
                 Timestamp offset (TimestampOffset) to 2003-1-25.

          TimedMetadataInsertion -> (structure)
              Enable  Timed  metadata  insertion  (TimedMetadataInsertion)  to
              include  ID3 tags in any HLS outputs. To include timed metadata,
              you must enable it here, enable it in each output container, and
              specify  tags  and  timecodes  in  ID3  insertion (Id3Insertion)
              objects.

              Id3Insertions -> (list)
                 Id3Insertions contains the array of Id3Insertion instances.

                 (structure)
                     To insert ID3 tags in your output,  specify  two  values.
                     Use  ID3  tag (Id3) to specify the base 64 encoded string
                     and use Timecode (TimeCode) to specify the time when  the
                     tag  should  be  inserted. To insert multiple ID3 tags in
                     your output, create multiple instances of  ID3  insertion
                     (Id3Insertion).

                     Id3 -> (string)
                        Use   ID3   tag  (Id3)  to  provide  a  tag  value  in
                        base64-encode format.

                     Timecode -> (string)
                        Provide  a  Timecode  (TimeCode)  in  HH:MM:SS:FF   or
                        HH:MM:SS;FF format.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To change a job template

       The  following update-job-template example replaces the JSON definition
       of the specified custom job template with the JSON  definition  in  the
       provided file.

       The  system  returns  the JSON payload that you send with your request,
       even when the request results in an error. Therefore, the JSON returned
       is not necessarily the new definition of the job template.

       Because  the  JSON  payload can be long, you might need to scroll up to
       see any error messages.

       Templates in the AWS Elemental MediaConvert User Guide.

OUTPUT
       JobTemplate -> (structure)
          A  job  template is a pre-made set of encoding instructions that you
          can use to quickly create a job.

          AccelerationSettings -> (structure)
              Accelerated transcoding can significantly  speed  up  jobs  with
              long, visually complex content.

              Mode -> (string)
                 Specify  the  conditions  when  the service will run your job
                 with accelerated transcoding.

          Arn -> (string)
              An identifier for this resource that is  unique  within  all  of
              AWS.

          Category -> (string)
              An  optional category you create to organize your job templates.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp in epoch seconds for Job template creation.

          Description -> (string)
              An optional description you create for each job template.

          HopDestinations -> (list)
              Optional list of hop destinations.

              (structure)
                 Optional. Configuration for a destination queue to which  the
                 job  can  hop  once  a customer-defined minimum wait time has
                 passed.

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     Optional. When you set up a job to use queue hopping, you
                     can  specify a different relative priority for the job in
                     the destination queue. If you don't specify, the relative
                     priority will remain the same as in the previous queue.

                 Queue -> (string)
                     Optional  unless  the  job  is  submitted  on the default
                     queue. When you set up a job to use  queue  hopping,  you
                     can specify a destination queue. This queue cannot be the
                     original queue to which the  job  is  submitted.  If  the
                     original  queue  isn't  the  default  queue and you don't
                     specify the destination queue, the job will move  to  the
                     default queue.

                 WaitMinutes -> (integer)
                     Required for setting up a job to use queue hopping. Mini-
                     mum wait time in minutes until the job  can  hop  to  the
                     destination  queue.  Valid  range  is  1 to 1440 minutes,
                     inclusive.

          LastUpdated -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp in epoch seconds when the Job  template  was  last
              updated.

          Name -> (string)
              A  name  you  create  for  each  job template. Each name must be
              unique within your account.

          Priority -> (integer)
              Relative priority on the job.

          Queue -> (string)
              Optional. The queue that jobs created  from  this  template  are
              assigned  to.  If  you  don't  specify this, jobs will go to the
              default queue.

          Settings -> (structure)
              JobTemplateSettings contains all the transcode settings saved in
              the template that will be applied to jobs created from it.

              AdAvailOffset -> (integer)
                 When specified, this offset (in milliseconds) is added to the
                 input Ad Avail PTS time.

              AvailBlanking -> (structure)
                 Settings for ad avail blanking. Video can be blanked or over-
                 laid  with an image, and audio muted during SCTE-35 triggered
                 ad avails.

                 AvailBlankingImage -> (string)
                     Blanking image to be used. Leave empty for  solid  black.
                     Only bmp and png images are supported.

              Esam -> (structure)
                 Settings  for  Event  Signaling  And Messaging (ESAM). If you
                 don't do ad insertion, you can ignore these settings.

                 ManifestConfirmConditionNotification -> (structure)
                     Specifies  an  ESAM  ManifestConfirmConditionNotification
                     XML as per OC-SP-ESAM-API-I03-131025. The transcoder uses
                     the manifest conditioning instructions that  you  provide
                     in the setting MCC XML (mccXml).

                     MccXml -> (string)
                        Provide your ESAM ManifestConfirmConditionNotification
                        XML document inside your JSON job settings.  Form  the
                        XML  document  as  per  OC-SP-ESAM-API-I03-131025. The
                        transcoder will use the Manifest Conditioning instruc-
                        tions in the message that you supply.

                 ResponseSignalPreroll -> (integer)
                     Specifies  the  stream distance, in milliseconds, between
                     the SCTE 35 messages that the transcoder places  and  the
                     splice points that they refer to. If the time between the
                     start of the asset and the SCTE-35 message is  less  than
                     this value, then the transcoder places the SCTE-35 marker
                     at the beginning of the stream.

                 SignalProcessingNotification -> (structure)
                     Specifies an ESAM SignalProcessingNotification XML as per
                     OC-SP-ESAM-API-I03-131025. The transcoder uses the signal
                     processing instructions that you provide in  the  setting
                     SCC XML (sccXml).

                     SccXml -> (string)
                        Provide  your  ESAM  SignalProcessingNotification  XML
                        document inside your JSON job settings. Form  the  XML
                        document   as   per   OC-SP-ESAM-API-I03-131025.   The
                        transcoder will use the signal processing instructions
                        in the message that you supply. Provide your ESAM Sig-
                        nalProcessingNotification  XML  document  inside  your
                        JSON  job settings. For your MPEG2-TS file outputs, if
                        you want the service to place SCTE-35 markers  at  the
                        insertion  points you specify in the XML document, you
                        must also enable SCTE-35 ESAM (scte35Esam). Note  that
                        you  can either specify an ESAM XML document or enable
                        SCTE-35 passthrough. You can't do both.

              ExtendedDataServices -> (structure)
                 If your source content has EIA-608  Line  21  Data  Services,
                 enable  this  feature  to specify what MediaConvert does with
                 the Extended Data Services (XDS) packets. You can  choose  to
                 pass through XDS packets, or remove them from the output. For
                 more information about XDS, see EIA-608 Line  Data  Services,
                 section 9.5.1.5 05h Content Advisory.

                 CopyProtectionAction -> (string)
                     The action to take on copy and redistribution control XDS
                     packets. If you select PASSTHROUGH, packets will  not  be
                     changed. If you select STRIP, any packets will be removed
                     in output captions.

                 VchipAction -> (string)
                     The action to take on content advisory  XDS  packets.  If
                     you  select  PASSTHROUGH, packets will not be changed. If
                     you select STRIP, any packets will be removed  in  output
                     captions.

              Inputs -> (list)
                 Use  Inputs  (inputs)  to  define the source file used in the
                 transcode job. There can only be one input in a job template.
                 Using the API, you can include multiple inputs when referenc-
                 ing a job template.

                 (structure)
                     Specified video input in a template.

                     AudioSelectorGroups -> (map)
                        Use audio selector groups to combine multiple  sidecar
                        audio  inputs  so that you can assign them to a single
                        output audio tab  (AudioDescription).  Note  that,  if
                        you're  working  with  embedded audio, it's simpler to
                        assign multiple  input  tracks  into  a  single  audio
                        selector rather than use an audio selector group.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (structure)
                            Use  audio  selector  groups  to  combine multiple
                            sidecar audio inputs so that you can  assign  them
                            to  a  single output audio tab (AudioDescription).
                            Note that, if you're working with embedded  audio,
                            it's  simpler to assign multiple input tracks into
                            a single audio selector rather than use  an  audio
                            selector group.

                            AudioSelectorNames -> (list)
                               Name of an Audio Selector within the same input
                               to include in the group. Audio  selector  names
                               are  standardized,  based on their order within
                               the input (e.g., "Audio Selector 1"). The audio
                               selector  name parameter can be repeated to add
                               any number of audio selectors to the group.

                               (string)

                     AudioSelectors -> (map)
                        Use Audio  selectors  (AudioSelectors)  to  specify  a
                        track  or  set  of tracks from the input that you will
                        use in your outputs. You can use multiple Audio selec-
                        tors per input.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (structure)
                            Use  Audio selectors (AudioSelectors) to specify a
                            track or set of tracks from  the  input  that  you
                            will  use  in  your  outputs. You can use multiple
                            Audio selectors per input.

                            CustomLanguageCode -> (string)
                               Selects a specific language code from within an
                               audio  source, using the ISO 639-2 or ISO 639-3
                               three-letter language code

                            DefaultSelection -> (string)
                               Enable this setting on one  audio  selector  to
                               set  it as the default for the job. The service
                               uses this default for outputs  where  it  can't
                               find  the  specified  input audio. If you don't
                               set a default, those outputs have no audio.

                            ExternalAudioFileInput -> (string)
                               Specifies audio  data  from  an  external  file
                               source.

                            HlsRenditionGroupSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings  specific  to  audio sources in an HLS
                               alternate rendition group. Specify the  proper-
                               ties (renditionGroupId, renditionName or rendi-
                               tionLanguageCode) to identify the unique  audio
                               track  among  the  alternative rendition groups
                               present in the HLS manifest. If no unique track
                               is  found, or multiple tracks match the proper-
                               ties provided, the job fails. If no  properties
                               in hlsRenditionGroupSettings are specified, the
                               default audio track within the video segment is
                               chosen.  If there is no audio within video seg-
                               ment, the alternative audio with DEFAULT=YES is
                               chosen instead.

                               RenditionGroupId -> (string)
                                   Optional. Specify alternative group ID

                               RenditionLanguageCode -> (string)
                                   Optional.  Specify  ISO  639-2 or ISO 639-3
                                   code in the language property

                               RenditionName -> (string)
                                   Optional. Specify media name

                            LanguageCode -> (string)
                               Selects a specific language code from within an
                               audio source.

                            Offset -> (integer)
                               Specifies  a time delta in milliseconds to off-
                               set the audio from the input video.

                            Pids -> (list)
                               Selects a specific PID  from  within  an  audio
                               source (e.g. 257 selects PID 0x101).

                               (integer)

                            ProgramSelection -> (integer)
                               Use this setting for input streams that contain
                               Dolby E, to have the service  extract  specific
                               program data from the track. To select multiple
                               programs, create multiple  selectors  with  the
                               same  Track  and  different Program numbers. In
                               the console, this setting is visible  when  you
                               set  Selector type to Track. Choose the program
                               number from the dropdown list. If you are send-
                               ing  a JSON file, provide the program ID, which
                               is part of the audio metadata.  If  your  input
                               file has incorrect metadata, you can choose All
                               channels instead of a program  number  to  have
                               the  service ignore the program IDs and include
                               all the programs in the track.

                            RemixSettings -> (structure)
                               Use these settings to reorder the  audio  chan-
                               nels  of  one  input  to match those of another
                               input. This allows you to combine the two files
                               into a single output, one after the other.

                               ChannelMapping -> (structure)
                                   Channel  mapping  (ChannelMapping) contains
                                   the group of fields that hold the  remixing
                                   value  for  each  channel,  in  dB. Specify
                                   remix values to indicate how  much  of  the
                                   content  from  your input audio channel you
                                   want in your output  audio  channels.  Each
                                   instance of the InputChannels or InputChan-
                                   nelsFineTune array specifies  these  values
                                   for one output channel. Use one instance of
                                   this array for each output channel. In  the
                                   console, each array corresponds to a column
                                   in the graphical depiction of  the  mapping
                                   matrix.  The  rows  of the graphical matrix
                                   correspond to input channels. Valid  values
                                   are   within  the  range  from  -60  (mute)
                                   through 6. A setting of 0 passes the  input
                                   channel unchanged to the output channel (no
                                   attenuation    or    amplification).    Use
                                   InputChannels  or  InputChannelsFineTune to
                                   specify your remix values. Don't use  both.

                                   OutputChannels -> (list)
                                      In  your JSON job specification, include
                                      one child  of  OutputChannels  for  each
                                      audio channel that you want in your out-
                                      put.  Each  child  should  contain   one
                                      instance  of InputChannels or InputChan-
                                      nelsFineTune.

                                      (structure)
                                          OutputChannel mapping settings.

                                          InputChannels -> (list)
                                             Use this setting to specify  your
                                             remix  values when they are inte-
                                             gers, such as -10, 0, or 4.

                                             (integer)

                                          InputChannelsFineTune -> (list)
                                             Use this setting to specify  your
                                             remix  values  when  they  have a
                                             decimal   component,   such    as
                                             -10.312,  0.08, or 4.9. MediaCon-
                                             vert rounds your remixing  values
                                             to the nearest thousandth.

                                             (double)

                               ChannelsIn -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the  number of audio channels from
                                   your input that you want  to  use  in  your
                                   output. With remixing, you might combine or
                                   split the data in these  channels,  so  the
                                   number  of  channels  in  your final output
                                   might be different. If you are  doing  both
                                   input  channel  mapping  and output channel
                                   mapping, the number of output  channels  in
                                   your  input mapping must be the same as the
                                   number of input  channels  in  your  output
                                   mapping.

                               ChannelsOut -> (integer)
                                   Specify the number of channels in this out-
                                   put after remixing. Valid values: 1, 2,  4,
                                   6,  8... 64. (1 and even numbers to 64.) If
                                   you are doing both  input  channel  mapping
                                   and  output  channel mapping, the number of
                                   output channels in your input mapping  must
                                   be the same as the number of input channels
                                   in your output mapping.

                            SelectorType -> (string)
                               Specifies the type of the audio selector.

                            Tracks -> (list)
                               Identify  a  track  from  the  input  audio  to
                               include  in this selector by entering the track
                               index number. To include several  tracks  in  a
                               single  audio selector, specify multiple tracks
                               as  follows.  Using  the   console,   enter   a
                               comma-separated  list. For examle, type "1,2,3"
                               to  include  tracks  1  through  3.  Specifying
                               directly  in  your  JSON  job file, provide the
                               track  numbers  in  an  array.   For   example,
                               "tracks": [1,2,3].

                               (integer)

                     CaptionSelectors -> (map)
                        Use  captions  selectors  to specify the captions data
                        from your input that you use in your outputs. You  can
                        use up to 20 captions selectors per input.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (structure)
                            Use  captions  selectors  to  specify the captions
                            data from your input that you use in your outputs.
                            You can use up to 20 captions selectors per input.

                            CustomLanguageCode -> (string)
                               The specific language to extract  from  source,
                               using  the  ISO 639-2 or ISO 639-3 three-letter
                               language code. If input  is  SCTE-27,  complete

                                      modify the times in the  captions  file.
                                      For  example,  type 15 to add 15 seconds
                                      to all the times in the  captions  file.
                                      Type  -5  to subtract 5 seconds from the
                                      times in  the  captions  file.  You  can

                                      units   (TimeDeltaUnits),   MediaConvert
                                      uses seconds by default.

                               SourceType -> (string)
                                   Use  Source  (SourceType)  to  identify the
                                   format of your input captions. The  service
                                   cannot auto-detect caption format.

                               TeletextSourceSettings -> (structure)
                                   Settings   specific   to  Teletext  caption
                                   sources, including Page number.

                                   PageNumber -> (string)
                                      Use Page Number (PageNumber) to  specify
                                      the  three-digit hexadecimal page number
                                      that will be used for Teletext captions.
                                      Do not use this setting if you are pass-
                                      ing  through  teletext  from  the  input
                                      source to output.

                               TrackSourceSettings -> (structure)
                                   Settings  specific  to caption sources that
                                   are specified by track  number.  Currently,
                                   this  is only IMSC captions in an IMF pack-
                                   age. If your caption source is IMSC 1.1  in
                                   a separate xml file, use FileSourceSettings
                                   instead of TrackSourceSettings.

                                   TrackNumber -> (integer)
                                      Use this setting to select a single cap-
                                      tions track from a source. Track numbers
                                      correspond to the order in the  captions
                                      source file. For IMF sources, track num-
                                      bering is based on the  order  that  the
                                      captions appear in the CPL. For example,
                                      use 1 to select the captions asset  that
                                      is  listed  first in the CPL. To include
                                      more than one captions track in your job
                                      outputs,  create multiple input captions
                                      selectors. Specify one track per  selec-
                                      tor.

                               WebvttHlsSourceSettings -> (structure)
                                   Settings  specific to WebVTT sources in HLS
                                   alternative rendition  group.  Specify  the
                                   properties (renditionGroupId, renditionName
                                   or renditionLanguageCode) to  identify  the
                                   unique subtitle track among the alternative
                                   rendition groups present in the  HLS  mani-
                                   fest.  If no unique track is found, or mul-
                                   tiple tracks match  the  specified  proper-
                                   ties,  the  job fails. If there is only one
                                   subtitle track in the rendition group,  the
                                   settings  can be left empty and the default
                                   subtitle track will be chosen. If your cap-
                                   tion  source  is  a sidecar file, use File-
                                   SourceSettings instead of  WebvttHlsSource-
                                   Settings.

                                   RenditionGroupId -> (string)

                                      Optional. Specify media name

                     Crop -> (structure)
                        Use Cropping selection (crop)  to  specify  the  video
                        area that the service will include in the output video
                        frame. If you specify a value here, it  will  override
                        any value that you specify in the output setting Crop-
                        ping selection (crop).

                        Height -> (integer)
                            Height of rectangle in pixels. Specify  only  even
                            numbers.

                        Width -> (integer)
                            Width  of  rectangle  in pixels. Specify only even
                            numbers.

                        X -> (integer)
                            The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and
                            the  left  edge  of  the video frame. Specify only
                            even numbers.

                        Y -> (integer)
                            The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and
                            the top edge of the video frame. Specify only even
                            numbers.

                     DeblockFilter -> (string)
                        Enable   Deblock   (InputDeblockFilter)   to   produce
                        smoother  motion  in  the output. Default is disabled.
                        Only manually controllable for MPEG2 and  uncompressed
                        video inputs.

                     DenoiseFilter -> (string)
                        Enable  Denoise  (InputDenoiseFilter)  to filter noise
                        from the input. Default is disabled.  Only  applicable
                        to MPEG2, H.264, H.265, and uncompressed video inputs.

                     DolbyVisionMetadataXml -> (string)
                        Use this setting only when your video source has Dolby
                        Vision  studio mastering metadata that is carried in a
                        separate XML file. Specify the Amazon S3 location  for
                        the  metadata XML file. MediaConvert uses this file to
                        provide global  and  frame-level  metadata  for  Dolby
                        Vision preprocessing. When you specify a file here and
                        your input also has interleaved global and frame level
                        metadata,  MediaConvert  ignores the interleaved meta-
                        data and uses only the the metadata from this external
                        XML  file.  Note that your IAM service role must grant
                        MediaConvert read permissions to this file.  For  more
                        information,                                       see

                     FilterEnable -> (string)
                        Specify   how  the  transcoding  service  applies  the
                        denoise and deblock filters. You must also enable  the
                        filters  separately, with Denoise (InputDenoiseFilter)
                        and  Deblock  (InputDeblockFilter).  *  Auto   -   The
                        transcoding  service  determines whether to apply fil-
                        tering, depending on input type and quality. * Disable
                        -  The input is not filtered. This is true even if you
                        use the API to enable them in (InputDeblockFilter) and
                        (InputDeblockFilter).  * Force - The input is filtered
                        regardless of input type.

                     FilterStrength -> (integer)
                        Use Filter strength  (FilterStrength)  to  adjust  the
                        magnitude  the  input  filter  settings  (Deblock  and
                        Denoise). The range is -5 to 5. Default is 0.

                     ImageInserter -> (structure)
                        Enable the image inserter feature to include a graphic
                        overlay  on your video. Enable or disable this feature
                        for each input individually. This setting is  disabled
                        by default.

                        InsertableImages -> (list)
                            Specify  the  images  that  you want to overlay on
                            your video. The images must be PNG or TGA files.

                            (structure)
                               These settings  apply  to  a  specific  graphic
                               overlay.  You  can include multiple overlays in
                               your job.

                               Duration -> (integer)
                                   Specify the time, in milliseconds, for  the
                                   image  to  remain on the output video. This
                                   duration  includes  fade-in  time  but  not
                                   fade-out time.

                               FadeIn -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the  length  of time, in millisec-
                                   onds, between the Start time that you spec-
                                   ify  for  the  image insertion and the time
                                   that the image  appears  at  full  opacity.
                                   Full  opacity is the level that you specify
                                   for the opacity setting. If you don't spec-
                                   ify  a  value  for  Fade-in, the image will
                                   appear abruptly at the overlay start  time.

                               FadeOut -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the  length  of time, in millisec-
                                   onds, between the end of the time that  you
                                   have  specified for the image overlay Dura-
                                   tion and when the overlaid image has  faded
                                   to total transparency. If you don't specify
                                   a value for Fade-out, the image will disap-
                                   pear  abruptly  at  the end of the inserted
                                   image duration.

                               Height -> (integer)
                                   Specify the height of the inserted image in
                                   pixels.  If  you  specify  a  value  that's
                                   larger than the  video  resolution  height,
                                   the  service  will crop your overlaid image
                                   to fit. To use the  native  height  of  the
                                   image, keep this setting blank.

                               ImageInserterInput -> (string)
                                   Specify the HTTP, HTTPS, or Amazon S3 loca-
                                   tion of the image that you want to  overlay
                                   on the video. Use a PNG or TGA file.

                               ImageX -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the  distance,  in pixels, between
                                   the inserted image and the left edge of the
                                   video frame. Required for any image overlay
                                   that you specify.

                               ImageY -> (integer)
                                   Specify the distance,  in  pixels,  between
                                   the  overlaid image and the top edge of the
                                   video frame. Required for any image overlay
                                   that you specify.

                               Layer -> (integer)
                                   Specify  how  overlapping  inserted  images
                                   appear. Images with higher values for Layer
                                   appear  on  top of images with lower values
                                   for Layer.

                               Opacity -> (integer)
                                   Use Opacity (Opacity) to specify  how  much
                                   of  the  underlying video shows through the
                                   inserted image. 0 is transparent and 100 is
                                   fully opaque. Default is 50.

                               StartTime -> (string)
                                   Specify  the timecode of the frame that you
                                   want the overlay to first appear  on.  This
                                   must   be   in   timecode  (HH:MM:SS:FF  or
                                   HH:MM:SS;FF) format. Remember to take  into
                                   account your timecode source settings.

                               Width -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the width of the inserted image in
                                   pixels.  If  you  specify  a  value  that's
                                   larger than the video resolution width, the
                                   service will crop your  overlaid  image  to
                                   fit.  To use the native width of the image,
                                   keep this setting blank.

                     InputClippings -> (list)
                        (InputClippings) contains sets of start and end  times
                        that  together  specify  a  portion of the input to be
                        used in the outputs. If you provide only a start time,
                        the  clip  will be the entire input from that point to
                        the end. If you provide only an end time, it  will  be
                        the  entire  input  up to that point. When you specify
                        more than one input clip, the transcoding service cre-
                        ates  the  job outputs by stringing the clips together
                        in the order you specify them.

                        (structure)
                            To transcode only portions of your input,  include
                            one  input  clip  for each part of your input that
                            you want in your output. All input clips that  you
                            specify  will  be  included in every output of the
                            job.      For      more      information,      see
                            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/assembling-multiple-inputs-and-input-clips.html.

                            EndTimecode -> (string)
                               Set End timecode (EndTimecode) to  the  end  of
                               the  portion of the input you are clipping. The
                               frame corresponding to the End  timecode  value
                               is  included in the clip. Start timecode or End
                               timecode may be left blank, but not  both.  Use
                               the format HH:MM:SS:FF or HH:MM:SS;FF, where HH
                               is the hour, MM is the minute, SS is  the  sec-
                               ond,  and FF is the frame number. When choosing
                               this value, take into account your setting  for
                               timecode  source  under  input settings (Input-
                               TimecodeSource).  For  example,  if  you   have
                               embedded  timecodes  that  start at 01:00:00:00
                               and you want your clip to end six minutes  into
                               the video, use 01:06:00:00.

                            StartTimecode -> (string)
                               Set   Start  timecode  (StartTimecode)  to  the
                               beginning of the portion of the input  you  are
                               clipping.  The frame corresponding to the Start
                               timecode value is included in the  clip.  Start
                               timecode or End timecode may be left blank, but
                               not  both.  Use  the  format   HH:MM:SS:FF   or
                               HH:MM:SS;FF,  where  HH  is the hour, MM is the
                               minute, SS is the second, and FF is  the  frame
                               number.  When  choosing  this  value, take into
                               account your setting for Input timecode source.
                               For  example,  if  you  have embedded timecodes
                               that start at 01:00:00:00  and  you  want  your
                               clip  to begin five minutes into the video, use
                               01:05:00:00.

                     InputScanType -> (string)
                        When you have  a  progressive  segmented  frame  (PsF)
                        input,  use  this  setting  to  flag the input as PsF.
                        MediaConvert doesn't automatically detect PsF.  There-
                        fore,  flagging  your  input  as PsF results in better
                        preservation of video quality when you do  deinterlac-
                        ing  and  frame rate conversion. If you don't specify,
                        the default value is Auto (AUTO). Auto is the  correct
                        setting  for  all  inputs  that are not PsF. Don't set
                        this value to PsF when your input is interlaced. Doing
                        so creates horizontal interlacing artifacts.

                     Position -> (structure)
                        Use Selection placement (position) to define the video
                        area in your output frame. The  area  outside  of  the
                        rectangle that you specify here is black. If you spec-
                        ify a value here, it will override any value that  you
                        specify  in  the  output  setting  Selection placement
                        (position). If you specify a  value  here,  this  will
                        override any AFD values in your input, even if you set
                        Respond to AFD (RespondToAfd) to Respond (RESPOND). If
                        you  specify  a  value here, this will ignore anything
                        that you specify  for  the  setting  Scaling  Behavior
                        (scalingBehavior).

                        Height -> (integer)
                            Height  of  rectangle in pixels. Specify only even
                            numbers.

                        Width -> (integer)
                            Width of rectangle in pixels.  Specify  only  even
                            numbers.

                        X -> (integer)
                            The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and
                            the left edge of the  video  frame.  Specify  only
                            even numbers.

                        Y -> (integer)
                            The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and
                            the top edge of the video frame. Specify only even
                            numbers.

                     ProgramNumber -> (integer)
                        Use  Program (programNumber) to select a specific pro-
                        gram from within  a  multi-program  transport  stream.
                        Note  that Quad 4K is not currently supported. Default
                        is the first program within the transport  stream.  If
                        the program you specify doesn't exist, the transcoding
                        service will use this default.

                     PsiControl -> (string)
                        Set PSI control (InputPsiControl) for transport stream
                        inputs  to  specify  which  data  the demux process to
                        scans. * Ignore PSI - Scan  all  PIDs  for  audio  and
                        video. * Use PSI - Scan only PSI data.

                     TimecodeSource -> (string)
                        Use  this  Timecode  source setting, located under the
                        input settings (InputTimecodeSource), to  specify  how
                        the  service  counts  input  video  frames. This input
                        frame count affects only the behavior of features that
                        apply to a single input at a time, such as input clip-
                        ping and synchronizing some captions  formats.  Choose
                        Embedded (EMBEDDED) to use the timecodes in your input
                        video. Choose Start at zero (ZEROBASED) to  start  the
                        first  frame  at  zero. Choose Specified start (SPECI-
                        FIEDSTART) to start the first frame  at  the  timecode
                        that  you specify in the setting Start timecode (time-
                        codeStart). If you don't specify a value for  Timecode
                        source,  the service will use Embedded by default. For
                        more     information     about     timecodes,      see
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/mediaconvert/timecode.

                     TimecodeStart -> (string)
                        Specify the timecode that you want the service to  use
                        for  this  input's initial frame. To use this setting,
                        you must set  the  Timecode  source  setting,  located
                        under  the  input  settings  (InputTimecodeSource), to
                        Specified start (SPECIFIEDSTART). For more information
                        about                  timecodes,                  see
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/mediaconvert/timecode.

                     VideoSelector -> (structure)
                        Input  video  selectors contain the video settings for
                        the input. Each of your inputs  can  have  up  to  one
                        video selector.

                        AlphaBehavior -> (string)
                            Ignore  this setting unless this input is a Quick-
                            Time animation with an  alpha  channel.  Use  this
                            setting  to  create separate Key and Fill outputs.
                            In each output, specify which part  of  the  input
                            MediaConvert  uses.  Leave  this  setting  at  the
                            default value DISCARD to delete the alpha  channel
                            and preserve the video. Set it to REMAP_TO_LUMA to
                            delete the video and map the alpha channel to  the
                            luma channel of your outputs.

                        ColorSpace -> (string)
                            If your input video has accurate color space meta-
                            data, or if you  don't  know  about  color  space,
                            leave  this  set to the default value Follow (FOL-
                            LOW). The service will automatically  detect  your
                            input  color  space. If your input video has meta-
                            data indicating the wrong color space, specify the
                            accurate  color space here. If your input video is
                            HDR 10 and the SMPTE  ST  2086  Mastering  Display
                            Color Volume static metadata isn't present in your
                            video stream, or if that metadata is  present  but
                            not  accurate,  choose  Force HDR 10 (FORCE_HDR10)
                            here and specify correct values in the  input  HDR
                            10  metadata  (Hdr10Metadata)  settings.  For more
                            information  about  MediaConvert  HDR  jobs,   see
                            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/mediaconvert/hdr.

                        ColorSpaceUsage -> (string)
                            There are two  sources  for  color  metadata,  the
                            input  file and the job input settings Color space
                            (ColorSpace) and HDR  master  display  information
                            settings(Hdr10Metadata).  The  Color  space  usage
                            setting determines which takes precedence.  Choose
                            Force (FORCE) to use color metadata from the input
                            job settings. If  you  don't  specify  values  for
                            those  settings,  the  service  defaults  to using
                            metadata from your input. FALLBACK - Choose  Fall-
                            back  (FALLBACK)  to  use  color metadata from the
                            source when it is present.  If  there's  no  color
                            metadata  in your input file, the service defaults
                            to using values you specify in the input settings.

                        Hdr10Metadata -> (structure)
                            Use these settings to provide HDR 10 metadata that
                            is missing or  inaccurate  in  your  input  video.
                            Appropriate  values  vary  depending  on the input
                            video and must be provided by a color grader.  The
                            color grader generates these values during the HDR
                            10 mastering process. The valid range for each  of
                            these settings is 0 to 50,000. Each increment rep-
                            resents  0.00002  in  CIE1931  color   coordinate.
                            Related  settings - When you specify these values,
                            you must also set Color space (ColorSpace) to  HDR
                            10  (HDR10). To specify whether the the values you
                            specify here take precedence over  the  values  in
                            the  metadata  of your input file, set Color space
                            usage (ColorSpaceUsage). To specify whether  color
                            metadata is included in an output, set Color meta-
                            data (ColorMetadata). For more  information  about
                            MediaConvert         HDR         jobs,         see

                            BluePrimaryX -> (integer)
                               HDR Master Display Information must be provided
                               by a color grader, using color  grading  tools.
                               Range is 0 to 50,000, each increment represents
                               0.00002 in CIE1931 color coordinate. Note  that
                               this setting is not for color correction.

                            BluePrimaryY -> (integer)
                               HDR Master Display Information must be provided
                               by a color grader, using color  grading  tools.
                               Range is 0 to 50,000, each increment represents

                            WhitePointY -> (integer)
                               HDR Master Display Information must be provided
                               by a color grader, using color  grading  tools.

                        Pid -> (integer)
                            Use  PID  (Pid) to select specific video data from
                            an input file. Specify this value as  an  integer;
                            the  system  automatically converts it to the hex-
                            idecimal  value.  For  example,  257  selects  PID
                            0x101.  A PID, or packet identifier, is an identi-
                            fier for a set of  data  in  an  MPEG-2  transport
                            stream container.

                        ProgramNumber -> (integer)
                            Selects   a   specific   program   from  within  a
                            multi-program transport stream. Note that Quad  4K
                            is not currently supported.

                        Rotate -> (string)
                            Use  Rotate  (InputRotate) to specify how the ser-
                            vice rotates your video. You can choose  automatic
                            rotation  or specify a rotation. You can specify a
                            clockwise rotation of 0, 90, 180, or 270  degrees.
                            If  your input video container is .mov or .mp4 and
                            your input has rotation metadata, you  can  choose
                            Automatic  to  have  the service rotate your video
                            according to the rotation specified in  the  meta-
                            data.  The  rotation  must be within one degree of
                            90, 180, or 270 degrees. If the rotation  metadata
                            specifies  any  other  rotation,  the service will
                            default to no rotation. By  default,  the  service
                            does  no  rotation,  even  if your input video has
                            rotation  metadata.  The  service   doesn't   pass
                            through rotation metadata.

                        SampleRange -> (string)
                            If  the  sample range metadata in your input video
                            is accurate, or if you  don't  know  about  sample
                            range,  keep  the  default value, Follow (FOLLOW),
                            for this setting. When you do, the  service  auto-
                            matically detects your input sample range. If your
                            input video has metadata indicating the wrong sam-
                            ple range, specify the accurate sample range here.
                            When you do, MediaConvert ignores any sample range
                            information  in  the input metadata. Regardless of
                            whether MediaConvert uses the input  sample  range
                            or the sample range that you specify, MediaConvert
                            uses the sample range  for  transcoding  and  also
                            writes it to the output metadata.

              KantarWatermark -> (structure)
                 Use  these  settings  only  when you use Kantar watermarking.
                 Specify the values that MediaConvert  uses  to  generate  and
                 place  Kantar watermarks in your output audio. These settings
                 apply to every output in your job. In addition to  specifying
                 these  values, you also need to store your Kantar credentials
                 in  AWS  Secrets   Manager.   For   more   information,   see
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/kantar-watermarking.html.

                 ChannelName -> (string)
                     Provide an audio channel  name  from  your  Kantar  audio
                     license.

                 ContentReference -> (string)
                     Specify  a  unique  identifier for Kantar to use for this
                     piece of content.

                 CredentialsSecretName -> (string)
                     Provide the name of the AWS Secrets Manager secret  where
                     your Kantar credentials are stored. Note that your Media-
                     Convert service role must provide access to this  secret.

                 FileOffset -> (double)
                     Optional.  Specify  an offset, in whole seconds, from the
                     start of your output and the beginning of the  watermark-
                     ing. When you don't specify an offset, Kantar defaults to
                     zero.

                 KantarLicenseId -> (integer)
                     Provide your Kantar license ID  number.  You  should  get
                     this number from Kantar.

                 KantarServerUrl -> (string)
                     Provide  the  HTTPS  endpoint  to  the Kantar server. You
                     should get this endpoint from Kantar.

                 LogDestination -> (string)
                     Optional. Specify the Amazon S3  bucket  where  you  want
                     MediaConvert  to  store  your  Kantar watermark XML logs.
                     When you don't specify  a  bucket,  MediaConvert  doesn't
                     save these logs. Note that your MediaConvert service role
                     must provide access to this location. For  more  informa-
                     tion,                                                 see
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/iam-role.html

                 Metadata3 -> (string)
                     You  can  optionally  use this field to specify the first
                     timestamp that Kantar embeds during watermarking.  Kantar
                     suggests that you be very cautious when using this Kantar
                     feature, and that you use it only on  channels  that  are
                     managed  specifically  for  use with this feature by your
                     Audience Measurement Operator. For more information about
                     this feature, contact Kantar technical support.

                 Metadata4 -> (string)
                     Additional  metadata  that  MediaConvert sends to Kantar.
                     Maximum length is 50 characters.

                 Metadata5 -> (string)
                     Additional metadata that MediaConvert  sends  to  Kantar.
                     Maximum length is 50 characters.

                 Metadata6 -> (string)
                     Additional  metadata  that  MediaConvert sends to Kantar.
                     Maximum length is 50 characters.

                 Metadata7 -> (string)
                     Additional metadata that MediaConvert  sends  to  Kantar.
                     Maximum length is 50 characters.

                 Metadata8 -> (string)
                     Additional  metadata  that  MediaConvert sends to Kantar.
                     Maximum length is 50 characters.

              MotionImageInserter -> (structure)
                 Overlay motion graphics on top  of  your  video.  The  motion
                 graphics  that  you specify here appear on all outputs in all
                 output     groups.     For     more     information,      see
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/motion-graphic-overlay.html.

                 Framerate -> (structure)
                     If your motion graphic asset is a .mov  file,  keep  this
                     setting  unspecified.  If  your motion graphic asset is a
                     series of .png files, specify the frame rate of the over-
                     lay  in  frames  per  second, as a fraction. For example,
                     specify 24 fps as 24/1. Make  sure  that  the  number  of
                     images  in  your  series  matches the frame rate and your
                     intended overlay duration. For example,  if  you  want  a
                     30-second  overlay  at  30  fps, you should have 900 .png
                     images. This overlay frame rate doesn't need to match the
                     frame rate of the underlying video.

                     FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                        The bottom of the fraction that expresses your overlay
                        frame rate. For example, if your frame rate is 24 fps,
                        set this value to 1.

                     FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                        The  top  of  the fraction that expresses your overlay
                        frame rate. For example, if your frame rate is 24 fps,
                        set this value to 24.

                 Input -> (string)
                     Specify  the  .mov  file or series of .png files that you
                     want to overlay on your video. For  .png  files,  provide
                     the  file name of the first file in the series. Make sure
                     that the names of the .png files end with sequential num-
                     bers  that specify the order that they are played in. For
                     example,    overlay_000.png,    overlay_001.png,    over-
                     lay_002.png,  and so on. The sequence must start at zero,
                     and each image file name must have  the  same  number  of
                     digits.  Pad your initial file names with enough zeros to
                     complete the sequence. For example, if the first image is
                     overlay_0.png,  there  can  be  only  10  images  in  the
                     sequence, with the last image being overlay_9.png. But if
                     the  first  image  is  overlay_00.png,  there  can be 100
                     images in the sequence.

                 InsertionMode -> (string)
                     Choose the type of motion graphic asset that you are pro-
                     viding  for  your  overlay.  You can choose either a .mov
                     file or a series of .png files.

                 Offset -> (structure)
                     Use Offset  to  specify  the  placement  of  your  motion
                     graphic  overlay  on  the video frame. Specify in pixels,
                     from the upper-left corner of the  frame.  If  you  don't
                     specify an offset, the service scales your overlay to the
                     full size of the frame. Otherwise,  the  service  inserts
                     the  overlay at its native resolution and scales the size
                     up or down with any video scaling.

                     ImageX -> (integer)
                        Set the distance, in pixels, between the  overlay  and
                        the left edge of the video frame.

                     ImageY -> (integer)
                        Set  the  distance, in pixels, between the overlay and
                        the top edge of the video frame.

                 Playback -> (string)
                     Specify whether your motion graphic overlay repeats on  a
                     loop or plays only once.

                 StartTime -> (string)
                     Specify when the motion overlay begins. Use timecode for-
                     mat (HH:MM:SS:FF or  HH:MM:SS;FF).  Make  sure  that  the
                     timecode you provide here takes into account how you have
                     set up your timecode configuration under  both  job  set-
                     tings  and input settings. The simplest way to do that is
                     to set both to start at 0. If you need to set up your job
                     to  follow  timecodes  embedded in your source that don't
                     start at zero, make sure that you specify  a  start  time
                     that  is  after  the  first  embedded  timecode. For more
                     information,  see   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediacon-

              NielsenConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Settings for your Nielsen  configuration.  If  you  don't  do
                 Nielsen  measurement  and  analytics,  ignore these settings.
                 When you enable Nielsen configuration (nielsenConfiguration),
                 MediaConvert  enables  PCM  to ID3 tagging for all outputs in
                 the job. To enable  Nielsen  configuration  programmatically,
                 include  an instance of nielsenConfiguration in your JSON job
                 specification. Even if you  don't  include  any  children  of
                 nielsenConfiguration, you still enable the setting.

                 BreakoutCode -> (integer)
                     Nielsen  has  discontinued the use of breakout code func-
                     tionality. If you must include  this  property,  set  the
                     value to zero.

                 DistributorId -> (string)
                     Use  Distributor  ID  (DistributorID) to specify the dis-
                     tributor ID that is  assigned  to  your  organization  by
                     Neilsen.

              NielsenNonLinearWatermark -> (structure)
                 Ignore these settings unless you are using Nielsen non-linear
                 watermarking. Specify the values that  MediaConvert  uses  to
                 generate  and  place Nielsen watermarks in your output audio.
                 In addition to specifying these values, you also need to  set
                 up  your cloud TIC server. These settings apply to every out-
                 put in your job. The MediaConvert implementation is currently
                 with  the  following  Nielsen versions: Nielsen Watermark SDK
                 Version 5.2.1 Nielsen  NLM  Watermark  Engine  Version  1.2.7
                 Nielsen Watermark Authenticator [SID_TIC] Version [5.0.0]

                 ActiveWatermarkProcess -> (string)
                     Choose  the  type  of Nielsen watermarks that you want in
                     your  outputs.  When   you   choose   NAES   2   and   NW
                     (NAES2_AND_NW),  you must provide a value for the setting
                     SID (sourceId). When you choose  CBET  (CBET),  you  must
                     provide a value for the setting CSID (cbetSourceId). When
                     you choose NAES 2, NW, and CBET  (NAES2_AND_NW_AND_CBET),
                     you must provide values for both of these settings.

                 AdiFilename -> (string)
                     Optional.  Use  this setting when you want the service to
                     include an ADI file in the Nielsen metadata .zip file. To
                     provide  an ADI file, store it in Amazon S3 and provide a
                     URL to it here. The URL should be in the  following  for-
                     mat:   S3://bucket/path/ADI-file.  For  more  information
                     about the metadata .zip file, see  the  setting  Metadata
                     destination (metadataDestination).

                 AssetId -> (string)
                     Use  the asset ID that you provide to Nielsen to uniquely
                     identify this asset. Required for all Nielsen  non-linear
                     watermarking.

                 AssetName -> (string)
                     Use  the  asset name that you provide to Nielsen for this
                     asset. Required for all Nielsen non-linear  watermarking.

                 CbetSourceId -> (string)
                     Use  the  CSID  that  Nielsen  provides to you. This CBET
                     source ID should be unique to your  Nielsen  account  but
                     common to all of your output assets that have CBET water-
                     marking. Required when you choose a value for the setting
                     Watermark  types  (ActiveWatermarkProcess)  that includes
                     CBET.

                 EpisodeId -> (string)
                     Optional. If this asset uses an episode ID with  Nielsen,
                     provide it here.

                 MetadataDestination -> (string)
                     Specify  the  Amazon S3 location where you want MediaCon-
                     vert to save your Nielsen non-linear metadata .zip  file.
                     This  Amazon  S3 bucket must be in the same Region as the
                     one where you do your MediaConvert  transcoding.  If  you
                     want  to  include  an ADI file in this .zip file, use the
                     setting ADI file (adiFilename) to specify  it.  MediaCon-
                     vert  delivers  the  Nielsen  metadata .zip files only to
                     your metadata destination Amazon S3  bucket.  It  doesn't
                     deliver  the  .zip  files to Nielsen. You are responsible
                     for delivering the metadata .zip files to Nielsen.

                 SourceId -> (integer)
                     Use the SID that Nielsen provides to you. This source  ID
                     should  be  unique  to your Nielsen account but common to
                     all of your  output  assets.  Required  for  all  Nielsen
                     non-linear watermarking. This ID should be unique to your
                     Nielsen account but common to all of your output  assets.
                     Required for all Nielsen non-linear watermarking.

                 SourceWatermarkStatus -> (string)
                     Required.  Specify  whether  your  source content already
                     contains Nielsen non-linear watermarks. When you set this
                     value to Watermarked (WATERMARKED), the service fails the
                     job. Nielsen requires that you add non-linear  watermark-
                     ing  to  only  clean  content  that  doesn't already have
                     non-linear Nielsen watermarks.

                 TicServerUrl -> (string)
                     Specify the endpoint for the TIC  server  that  you  have
                     deployed  and  configured  in the AWS Cloud. Required for
                     all Nielsen non-linear watermarking.  MediaConvert  can't
                     connect  directly  to a TIC server. Instead, you must use
                     API Gateway to provide a RESTful interface between Media-
                     Convert  and  a  TIC  server  that you deploy in your AWS
                     account. For more information on deploying a  TIC  server
                     in your AWS account and the required API Gateway, contact
                     Nielsen support.

                 UniqueTicPerAudioTrack -> (string)
                     To create assets that have the same TIC  values  in  each
                     audio   track,   keep   the   default  value  Share  TICs
                     (SAME_TICS_PER_TRACK). To create assets that have  unique
                     TIC  values  for each audio track, choose Use unique TICs
                     (RESERVE_UNIQUE_TICS_PER_TRACK).

              OutputGroups -> (list)
                 (OutputGroups) contains one group of settings for each set of
                 outputs  that  share  a  common  package type. All unpackaged
                 files (MPEG-4, MPEG-2 TS, Quicktime, MXF, and  no  container)
                 are  grouped  in  a  single output group as well. Required in
                 (OutputGroups) is a group of settings that apply to the whole
                 group.  This required object depends on the value you set for
                 (Type) under (OutputGroups)>(OutputGroupSettings). Type, set-
                 tings  object  pairs  are  as follows. * FILE_GROUP_SETTINGS,
                 FileGroupSettings *  HLS_GROUP_SETTINGS,  HlsGroupSettings  *
                 DASH_ISO_GROUP_SETTINGS,        DashIsoGroupSettings        *
                 MS_SMOOTH_GROUP_SETTINGS,       MsSmoothGroupSettings       *
                 CMAF_GROUP_SETTINGS, CmafGroupSettings

                 (structure)
                     Group of outputs

                     AutomatedEncodingSettings -> (structure)
                        Use  automated  encoding  to  have MediaConvert choose
                        your encoding settings for you, based on  characteris-
                        tics of your input video.

                        AbrSettings -> (structure)
                            Use  automated ABR to have MediaConvert set up the
                            renditions in your ABR package for  you  automati-
                            cally,  based  on  characteristics  of  your input
                            video. This feature optimizes video quality  while
                            minimizing the overall size of your ABR package.

                            MaxAbrBitrate -> (integer)
                               Optional.  The  maximum target bit rate used in
                               your automated ABR stack. Use this value to set
                               an upper limit on the bandwidth consumed by the
                               highest-quality rendition. This is  the  rendi-
                               tion  that  is  delivered  to  viewers with the
                               fastest  internet  connections.  If  you  don't
                               specify a value, MediaConvert uses 8,000,000 (8
                               mb/s) by default.

                            MaxRenditions -> (integer)
                               Optional. The maximum number of renditions that
                               MediaConvert  will create in your automated ABR
                               stack. The number of renditions  is  determined
                               automatically,  based  on analysis of each job,
                               but will never exceed this limit. When you  set
                               this  to  Auto in the console, which is equiva-
                               lent to excluding it from your JSON job  speci-
                               fication,  MediaConvert  defaults to a limit of
                               15.

                            MinAbrBitrate -> (integer)
                               Optional. The minimum target  bitrate  used  in
                               your automated ABR stack. Use this value to set
                               a lower limit on the bitrate of video delivered
                               to  viewers  with slow internet connections. If
                               you don't specify a  value,  MediaConvert  uses
                               600,000 (600 kb/s) by default.

                     CustomName -> (string)
                        Use  Custom  Group Name (CustomName) to specify a name
                        for the output group. This value is displayed  on  the
                        console  and  can  make  your  job  settings JSON more
                        human-readable. It does not affect your  outputs.  Use
                        up  to twelve characters that are either letters, num-
                        bers, spaces, or underscores.

                     Name -> (string)
                        Name of the output group

                     OutputGroupSettings -> (structure)
                        Output Group settings, including type

                        CmafGroupSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings related to your CMAF output package.  For
                            more                information,               see

                            When you work directly in your JSON job specifica-
                            tion, include this object and any  required  chil-
                            dren when you set Type, under OutputGroupSettings,
                            to CMAF_GROUP_SETTINGS.

                            AdditionalManifests -> (list)
                               By default, the service creates  one  top-level
                               .m3u8 HLS manifest and one top -level .mpd DASH
                               manifest for each CMAF  output  group  in  your
                               job.  These  default  manifests reference every
                               output in the output  group.  To  create  addi-
                               tional  top-level  manifests  that  reference a
                               subset of the  outputs  in  the  output  group,
                               specify  a  list  of  them here. For each addi-
                               tional manifest that you specify,  the  service
                               creates one HLS manifest and one DASH manifest.

                               (structure)
                                   Specify the details for each  pair  of  HLS
                                   and DASH additional manifests that you want
                                   the service to generate for this CMAF  out-
                                   put  group. Each pair of manifests can ref-
                                   erence a different subset of outputs in the
                                   group.

                                   ManifestNameModifier -> (string)
                                      Specify a name modifier that the service
                                      adds to the name  of  this  manifest  to
                                      make it different from the file names of
                                      the other main manifests in  the  output
                                      group. For example, say that the default
                                      main manifest  for  your  HLS  group  is
                                      film-name.m3u8.  If  you enter "-no-pre-
                                      mium" for this setting,  then  the  file

                                      ferent from the nameModifier of the out-
                                      put. The service uses  the  output  name
                                      modifier  to create unique names for the
                                      individual variant manifests.

                                   SelectedOutputs -> (list)
                                      Specify the outputs that you  want  this
                                      additional  top-level manifest to refer-
                                      ence.

                                      (string)

                            BaseUrl -> (string)
                               A partial URI prefix that will be  put  in  the
                               manifest file at the top level BaseURL element.
                               Can be used if streams  are  delivered  from  a
                               different URL than the manifest file.

                            ClientCache -> (string)
                               Disable  this  setting  only when your workflow
                               requires the #EXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:no tag.  Other-
                               wise,  keep the default value Enabled (ENABLED)
                               and control caching in your video  distribution
                               set up. For example, use the Cache-Control http
                               header.

                            CodecSpecification -> (string)
                               Specification to use (RFC-6381 or  the  default
                               RFC-4281) during m3u8 playlist generation.

                            Destination -> (string)
                               Use Destination (Destination) to specify the S3
                               output location and the output  filename  base.
                               Destination  accepts format identifiers. If you
                               do not specify the base filename  in  the  URI,
                               the  service will use the filename of the input
                               file. If your job has multiple inputs, the ser-
                               vice uses the filename of the first input file.

                            DestinationSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings associated with the destination.  Will
                               vary based on the type of destination

                               S3Settings -> (structure)
                                   Settings associated with S3 destination

                                   AccessControl -> (structure)
                                      Optional.  Have  MediaConvert  automati-
                                      cally apply Amazon S3 access control for
                                      the  outputs  in this output group. When
                                      you don't use this setting, S3 automati-
                                      cally applies the default access control
                                      list PRIVATE.

                                      CannedAcl -> (string)
                                          Choose an Amazon S3 canned  ACL  for
                                          MediaConvert  to  apply to this out-
                                          put.

                                   Encryption -> (structure)
                                      Settings for how your  job  outputs  are
                                      encrypted as they are uploaded to Amazon
                                      S3.

                                      EncryptionType -> (string)
                                          Specify how you want your data  keys
                                          managed.   AWS  uses  data  keys  to
                                          encrypt  your  content.   AWS   also
                                          encrypts  the  data keys themselves,
                                          using a customer master  key  (CMK),
                                          and  then  stores the encrypted data
                                          keys alongside your  encrypted  con-
                                          tent.  Use  this  setting to specify
                                          which AWS service manages  the  CMK.
                                          For  simplest  set up, choose Amazon
                                          S3  (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_S3).  If
                                          you  want your master key to be man-
                                          aged by AWS Key  Management  Service
                                          (KMS),      choose      AWS      KMS
                                          (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).     By
                                          default,  when  you  choose AWS KMS,
                                          KMS uses the  AWS  managed  customer
                                          master  key  (CMK)  associated  with
                                          Amazon S3 to encrypt your data keys.
                                          You can optionally choose to specify
                                          a different, customer  managed  CMK.
                                          Do   so  by  specifying  the  Amazon
                                          Resource Name (ARN) of the  key  for
                                          the setting KMS ARN (kmsKeyArn).

                                      KmsEncryptionContext -> (string)
                                          Optionally,  specify  the encryption
                                          context that you want to use  along-
                                          side your KMS key. AWS KMS uses this
                                          encryption  context  as   additional
                                          authenticated  data (AAD) to support
                                          authenticated encryption. This value
                                          must   be   a  base64-encoded  UTF-8
                                          string holding JSON which represents
                                          a  string-string  map.  To  use this
                                          setting,   you   must    also    set
                                          Server-side   encryption  (S3Server-
                                          SideEncryptionType)   to   AWS   KMS
                                          (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).    For
                                          more  information  about  encryption
                                          context,                        see:

                                      KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                                          Optionally,   specify  the  customer
                                          master key (CMK) that  you  want  to
                                          use to encrypt the data key that AWS
                                          uses to encrypt your output content.
                                          Enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                                          of the CMK. To use this setting, you
                                          must also set Server-side encryption
                                          (S3ServerSideEncryptionType) to  AWS
                                          KMS (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS). If
                                          you set  Server-side  encryption  to
                                          AWS  KMS  but  don't  specify  a CMK
                                          here, AWS uses the AWS  managed  CMK
                                          associated with Amazon S3.

                            Encryption -> (structure)
                               DRM settings.

                               ConstantInitializationVector -> (string)
                                   This is a 128-bit, 16-byte hex value repre-
                                   sented by a 32-character  text  string.  If
                                   this parameter is not set then the Initial-
                                   ization Vector will follow the segment num-
                                   ber by default.

                               EncryptionMethod -> (string)
                                   Specify the encryption scheme that you want
                                   the service to  use  when  encrypting  your
                                   CMAF  segments.  Choose  AES-CBC  subsample
                                   (SAMPLE-AES) or AES_CTR (AES-CTR).

                               InitializationVectorInManifest -> (string)
                                   When you use DRM with CMAF outputs,  choose
                                   whether  the  service  writes  the  128-bit
                                   encryption initialization vector in the HLS
                                   and DASH manifests.

                               SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)
                                   If  your  output  group  type  is CMAF, use
                                   these settings when  doing  DRM  encryption
                                   with  a  SPEKE-compliant  key  provider. If
                                   your output group type  is  HLS,  DASH,  or
                                   Microsoft  Smooth, use the SpekeKeyProvider
                                   settings instead.

                                   CertificateArn -> (string)
                                      If you want your key provider to encrypt
                                      the  content  keys  that  it provides to
                                      MediaConvert, set up a certificate  with
                                      a  master key using AWS Certificate Man-
                                      ager. Specify the  certificate's  Amazon
                                      Resource Name (ARN) here.

                                   DashSignaledSystemIds -> (list)
                                      Specify the DRM system IDs that you want
                                      signaled in the DASH manifest that Medi-

                            FragmentLength -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  length,  in whole seconds, of the
                               mp4 fragments. When you don't specify a  value,
                               MediaConvert  defaults  to  2. Related setting:
                               Use Fragment length control (FragmentLengthCon-
                               trol)  to  specify whether the encoder enforces
                               this value strictly.

                            ImageBasedTrickPlay -> (string)
                               Specify whether MediaConvert  generates  images
                               for  trick  play.  Keep the default value, None
                               (NONE), to  not  generate  any  images.  Choose
                               Thumbnail  (THUMBNAIL) to generate tiled thumb-
                               nails. Choose Thumbnail and full frame  (THUMB-
                               NAIL_AND_FULLFRAME)  to  generate  tiled thumb-
                               nails  and  full-resolution  images  of  single
                               frames.  When  you  enable  Write  HLS manifest
                               (WriteHlsManifest),  MediaConvert   creates   a
                               child  manifest for each set of images that you
                               generate and adds corresponding entries to  the
                               parent  manifest.  When  you  enable Write DASH
                               manifest (WriteDashManifest), MediaConvert adds
                               an  entry  in the .mpd manifest for each set of
                               images that you generate. A common  application
                               for these images is Roku trick mode. The thumb-

                               IntervalCadence -> (string)
                                   The cadence MediaConvert follows for gener-
                                   ating thumbnails. If set to  FOLLOW_IFRAME,
                                   MediaConvert  generates thumbnails for each
                                   IDR frame in the output (matching  the  GOP
                                   cadence).  If  set to FOLLOW_CUSTOM, Media-
                                   Convert generates thumbnails  according  to
                                   the interval you specify in thumbnailInter-
                                   val.

                               ThumbnailHeight -> (integer)
                                   Height of each thumbnail within  each  tile
                                   image,  in  pixels. Leave blank to maintain
                                   aspect ratio with thumbnail width. If  fol-
                                   lowing  the  aspect  ratio  would lead to a
                                   total tile height greater than  4096,  then
                                   the job will be rejected. Must be divisible
                                   by 2.

                               ThumbnailInterval -> (double)
                                   Enter the interval, in seconds, that Media-
                                   Convert uses to generate thumbnails. If the
                                   interval you enter doesn't align  with  the
                                   output  frame  rate, MediaConvert automati-
                                   cally rounds the interval to align with the
                                   output frame rate. For example, if the out-
                                   put frame rate is 29.97 frames  per  second
                                   and  you  enter  5, MediaConvert uses a 150
                                   frame interval to generate thumbnails.

                               ThumbnailWidth -> (integer)
                                   Width of each thumbnail  within  each  tile
                                   image,  in  pixels. Default is 312. Must be
                                   divisible by 8.

                               TileHeight -> (integer)
                                   Number of thumbnails in each  column  of  a
                                   tile image. Set a value between 2 and 2048.
                                   Must be divisible by 2.

                               TileWidth -> (integer)
                                   Number of thumbnails in each row of a  tile
                                   image. Set a value between 1 and 512.

                            ManifestCompression -> (string)
                               When set to GZIP, compresses HLS playlist.

                            ManifestDurationFormat -> (string)
                               Indicates  whether  the  output manifest should
                               use floating point values for segment duration.

                            MinBufferTime -> (integer)
                               Minimum  time  of initially buffered media that
                               is needed to ensure smooth playout.

                            MinFinalSegmentLength -> (double)
                               Keep this setting at the default  value  of  0,
                               unless  you  are troubleshooting a problem with
                               how devices play back the  end  of  your  video
                               asset.  If  you  know  that  player devices are
                               hanging on the  final  segment  of  your  video
                               because the length of your final segment is too
                               short, use this setting to  specify  a  minimum
                               final  segment  length,  in  seconds.  Choose a
                               value that is greater than or equal  to  1  and
                               less than your segment length. When you specify
                               a value for this setting, the encoder will com-
                               bine any final segment that is shorter than the
                               length that you specify with the previous  seg-
                               ment.  For  example,  your  segment length is 3
                               seconds and your final segment  is  .5  seconds
                               without  a  minimum  final segment length; when
                               you set the minimum final segment length to  1,
                               your final segment is 3.5 seconds.

                            MpdProfile -> (string)
                               Specify  whether your DASH profile is on-demand
                               or  main.  When   you   choose   Main   profile
                               (MAIN_PROFILE),     the     service     signals
                               urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-main:2011  in  your
                               .mpd  DASH  manifest. When you choose On-demand
                               (ON_DEMAND_PROFILE),   the   service    signals
                               urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-on-demand:2011   in
                               your .mpd. When you choose On-demand, you  must
                               also  set the output group setting Segment con-
                               trol  (SegmentControl)  to  Single  file  (SIN-
                               GLE_FILE).

                            PtsOffsetHandlingForBFrames -> (string)
                               Use  this  setting  only when your output video
                               stream has B-frames, which causes  the  initial
                               presentation time stamp (PTS) to be offset from
                               the initial decode time  stamp  (DTS).  Specify
                               how  MediaConvert handles PTS when writing time
                               stamps in output DASH manifests.  Choose  Match
                               initial  PTS  (MATCH_INITIAL_PTS) when you want
                               MediaConvert to use  the  initial  PTS  as  the
                               first   time  stamp  in  the  manifest.  Choose
                               Zero-based (ZERO_BASED)  to  have  MediaConvert
                               ignore  the initial PTS in the video stream and
                               instead write the initial time stamp as zero in
                               the  manifest.  For  outputs  that  don't  have
                               B-frames, the time stamps in  your  DASH  mani-
                               fests  start  at zero regardless of your choice
                               here.

                            SegmentControl -> (string)
                               When set to SINGLE_FILE, a single  output  file
                               is  generated,  which  is  internally segmented
                               using the Fragment Length and  Segment  Length.
                               When  set  to SEGMENTED_FILES, separate segment
                               files will be created.

                            SegmentLength -> (integer)
                               Specify the length, in whole seconds,  of  each
                               segment. When you don't specify a value, Media-
                               Convert defaults to 10. Related  settings:  Use
                               Segment  length  control (SegmentLengthControl)
                               to specify whether the  encoder  enforces  this
                               value  strictly.  Use Segment control (CmafSeg-
                               mentControl) to  specify  whether  MediaConvert
                               creates  separate  segment files or one content
                               file that has  metadata  to  mark  the  segment
                               boundaries.

                            SegmentLengthControl -> (string)
                               Specify  how you want MediaConvert to determine
                               the segment length.  Choose  Exact  (EXACT)  to
                               have  the encoder use the exact length that you
                               specify with the setting Segment  length  (Seg-
                               mentLength).   This   might   result  in  extra
                               I-frames. Choose Multiple of GOP (GOP_MULTIPLE)
                               to  have  the  encoder  round  up  the  segment
                               lengths to match the next GOP boundary.

                            StreamInfResolution -> (string)
                               Include or  exclude  RESOLUTION  attribute  for
                               video  in EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag of variant mani-
                               fest.

                            TargetDurationCompatibilityMode -> (string)
                               When set to LEGACY, the segment target duration
                               is  always  rounded  up  to the nearest integer
                               value above its current value in seconds.  When
                               set  to  SPEC\_COMPLIANT,  the  segment  target
                               duration is rounded up to the  nearest  integer
                               value  if  fraction seconds are greater than or
                               equal to 0.5 (>= 0.5) and rounded down if  less
                               than  0.5 (<0.5). You may need to use LEGACY if
                               your client needs to  ensure  that  the  target
                               duration is always longer than the actual dura-
                               tion of the segment.  Some  older  players  may
                               experience interrupted playback when the actual
                               duration of a track in a segment is longer than
                               the target duration.

                            WriteDashManifest -> (string)
                               When  set  to ENABLED, a DASH MPD manifest will
                               be generated for this output.

                            WriteHlsManifest -> (string)
                               When set to ENABLED, an Apple HLS manifest will
                               be generated for this output.

                            WriteSegmentTimelineInRepresentation -> (string)
                               When  you  enable  Precise  segment duration in
                               DASH manifests (writeSegmentTimelineInRepresen-
                               tation),  your DASH manifest shows precise seg-
                               ment durations. The segment  duration  informa-
                               tion  appears  inside  the SegmentTimeline ele-
                               ment, inside SegmentTemplate at the Representa-
                               tion  level.  When  this feature isn't enabled,
                               the segment durations in your DASH manifest are
                               approximate.  The  segment duration information
                               appears in the duration attribute of  the  Seg-
                               mentTemplate element.

                        DashIsoGroupSettings -> (structure)

                            AdditionalManifests -> (list)
                               By  default,  the service creates one .mpd DASH
                               manifest for each DASH ISO output group in your
                               job.  This  default  manifest  references every
                               output in the output  group.  To  create  addi-
                               tional  DASH  manifests that reference a subset
                               of the outputs in the output group,  specify  a
                               list of them here.

                               (structure)
                                   Specify  the  details  for  each additional
                                   DASH manifest that you want the service  to
                                   generate  for this output group. Each mani-
                                   fest can reference a  different  subset  of
                                   outputs in the group.

                                   ManifestNameModifier -> (string)
                                      Specify a name modifier that the service
                                      adds to the name  of  this  manifest  to
                                      make it different from the file names of
                                      the other main manifests in  the  output
                                      group. For example, say that the default
                                      main manifest for  your  DASH  group  is
                                      film-name.mpd.  If  you  enter "-no-pre-
                                      mium" for this setting,  then  the  file
                                      name  the  service  generates  for  this
                                      top-level manifest is  film-name-no-pre-

                               Use  this setting only when your audio codec is
                               a Dolby one (AC3,  EAC3,  or  Atmos)  and  your
                               downstream  workflow  requires  that  your DASH
                               manifest use the  Dolby  channel  configuration
                               tag, rather than the MPEG one. For example, you
                               might need to  use  this  to  make  dynamic  ad
                               insertion  work.  Specify  which  audio channel
                               configuration scheme ID URI MediaConvert writes
                               in  your DASH manifest. Keep the default value,

                               FIGURATION),  to  have MediaConvert write this:
                               urn:mpeg:mpegB:cicp:ChannelConfiguration.
                               Choose Dolby channel configuration (DOLBY_CHAN-
                               NEL_CONFIGURATION) to have  MediaConvert  write
                               this                                   instead:

                            BaseUrl -> (string)
                               A  partial  URI  prefix that will be put in the

                            Destination -> (string)
                               Use Destination (Destination) to specify the S3
                               output  location  and the output filename base.
                               Destination accepts format identifiers. If  you
                               do  not  specify  the base filename in the URI,
                               the service will use the filename of the  input
                               file. If your job has multiple inputs, the ser-
                               vice uses the filename of the first input file.

                            DestinationSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings  associated with the destination. Will

                                      you don't use this setting, S3 automati-
                                      cally applies the default access control

                                      EncryptionType -> (string)
                                          Specify  how you want your data keys
                                          managed.  AWS  uses  data  keys   to
                                          encrypt   your   content.  AWS  also
                                          encrypts the data  keys  themselves,
                                          using  a  customer master key (CMK),
                                          and then stores the  encrypted  data
                                          keys  alongside  your encrypted con-
                                          tent. Use this  setting  to  specify
                                          which  AWS  service manages the CMK.
                                          For simplest set up,  choose  Amazon
                                          S3  (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_S3).  If
                                          you want your master key to be  man-

                                          (KMS),      choose      AWS      KMS
                                          (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).     By
                                          default, when you  choose  AWS  KMS,
                                          KMS  uses  the  AWS managed customer
                                          master  key  (CMK)  associated  with
                                          Amazon S3 to encrypt your data keys.
                                          You can optionally choose to specify
                                          a  different,  customer managed CMK.
                                          Do  so  by  specifying  the   Amazon
                                          Resource  Name  (ARN) of the key for
                                          the setting KMS ARN (kmsKeyArn).

                                          side your KMS key. AWS KMS uses this
                                          encryption   context  as  additional
                                          authenticated data (AAD) to  support

                                   will  exclude the access unit delimiter and
                                   will leave the SEI NAL units unencrypted.

                               SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)
                                   If your output group type is HLS, DASH,  or
                                   Microsoft  Smooth,  use these settings when
                                   doing DRM encryption with a SPEKE-compliant
                                   key  provider. If your output group type is
                                   CMAF, use the SpekeKeyProviderCmaf settings
                                   instead.

                                   CertificateArn -> (string)
                                      If you want your key provider to encrypt
                                      the content keys  that  it  provides  to
                                      MediaConvert,  set up a certificate with

                                      Specify  the  resource  ID   that   your
                                      SPEKE-compliant  key  provider  uses  to

                                      (string)

                                   Url -> (string)
                                      Specify  the  URL to the key server that
                                      your SPEKE-compliant  DRM  key  provider
                                      uses to provide keys for encrypting your
                                      content.

                            FragmentLength -> (integer)
                               Length of fragments to generate  (in  seconds).
                               Fragment  length  must  be  compatible with GOP
                               size and Framerate. Note  that  fragments  will
                               end  on  the next keyframe after this number of
                               seconds,  so  actual  fragment  length  may  be
                               longer.  When  Emit Single File is checked, the
                               fragmentation is internal to  a  single  output
                               file and it does not cause the creation of many
                               output files as in other output types.

                            HbbtvCompliance -> (string)

                            ImageBasedTrickPlay -> (string)
                               Specify whether MediaConvert  generates  images
                               for  trick  play.  Keep the default value, None
                               (NONE), to  not  generate  any  images.  Choose
                               Thumbnail  (THUMBNAIL) to generate tiled thumb-
                               nails. Choose Thumbnail and full frame  (THUMB-
                               NAIL_AND_FULLFRAME)  to  generate  tiled thumb-
                               nails  and  full-resolution  images  of  single
                               frames.  MediaConvert adds an entry in the .mpd

                               ate.  A  common application for these images is
                               Roku trick mode. The thumbnails and  full-frame
                               images that MediaConvert creates with this fea-

                               IntervalCadence -> (string)
                                   The cadence MediaConvert follows for gener-
                                   ating  thumbnails. If set to FOLLOW_IFRAME,
                                   MediaConvert generates thumbnails for  each
                                   IDR  frame  in the output (matching the GOP
                                   cadence). If set to  FOLLOW_CUSTOM,  Media-
                                   Convert  generates  thumbnails according to
                                   the interval you specify in thumbnailInter-
                                   val.

                               ThumbnailHeight -> (integer)
                                   Height  of  each thumbnail within each tile
                                   image, in pixels. Leave blank  to  maintain
                                   aspect  ratio with thumbnail width. If fol-
                                   lowing the aspect ratio  would  lead  to  a
                                   total  tile  height greater than 4096, then
                                   the job will be rejected. Must be divisible
                                   by 2.

                               ThumbnailInterval -> (double)
                                   Enter the interval, in seconds, that Media-
                                   Convert uses to generate thumbnails. If the
                                   interval  you  enter doesn't align with the
                                   output frame rate,  MediaConvert  automati-
                                   cally rounds the interval to align with the
                                   output frame rate. For example, if the out-
                                   put  frame  rate is 29.97 frames per second
                                   and you enter 5, MediaConvert  uses  a  150
                                   frame interval to generate thumbnails.

                               ThumbnailWidth -> (integer)
                                   Width  of  each  thumbnail within each tile
                                   image, in pixels. Default is 312.  Must  be
                                   divisible by 8.

                               TileHeight -> (integer)
                                   Number  of  thumbnails  in each column of a
                                   tile image. Set a value between 2 and 2048.
                                   Must be divisible by 2.

                               TileWidth -> (integer)
                                   Number  of thumbnails in each row of a tile
                                   image. Set a value between 1 and 512.

                            MinBufferTime -> (integer)
                               Minimum time of initially buffered  media  that
                               is needed to ensure smooth playout.

                            MinFinalSegmentLength -> (double)
                               Keep  this  setting  at the default value of 0,
                               unless you are troubleshooting a  problem  with
                               how  devices  play  back  the end of your video
                               asset. If you  know  that  player  devices  are
                               hanging  on  the  final  segment  of your video
                               because the length of your final segment is too
                               short,  use  this  setting to specify a minimum
                               final segment  length,  in  seconds.  Choose  a
                               value  that  is  greater than or equal to 1 and
                               less than your segment length. When you specify
                               a value for this setting, the encoder will com-
                               bine any final segment that is shorter than the
                               length  that you specify with the previous seg-
                               ment. For example, your  segment  length  is  3
                               seconds  and  your  final segment is .5 seconds
                               without a minimum final  segment  length;  when
                               you  set the minimum final segment length to 1,
                               your final segment is 3.5 seconds.

                            MpdProfile -> (string)
                               Specify whether your DASH profile is  on-demand
                               or   main.   When   you   choose  Main  profile
                               (MAIN_PROFILE),     the     service     signals
                               urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-main:2011  in  your
                               .mpd DASH manifest. When you  choose  On-demand
                               (ON_DEMAND_PROFILE),    the   service   signals
                               urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-on-demand:2011   in
                               your  .mpd. When you choose On-demand, you must
                               also set the output group setting Segment  con-
                               trol  (SegmentControl)  to  Single  file  (SIN-
                               GLE_FILE).

                            PtsOffsetHandlingForBFrames -> (string)
                               Use this setting only when  your  output  video
                               stream  has  B-frames, which causes the initial
                               presentation time stamp (PTS) to be offset from
                               the  initial  decode  time stamp (DTS). Specify
                               how MediaConvert handles PTS when writing  time
                               stamps  in  output DASH manifests. Choose Match
                               initial PTS (MATCH_INITIAL_PTS) when  you  want
                               MediaConvert  to  use  the  initial  PTS as the
                               first  time  stamp  in  the  manifest.   Choose
                               Zero-based  (ZERO_BASED)  to  have MediaConvert
                               ignore the initial PTS in the video stream  and
                               instead write the initial time stamp as zero in
                               the  manifest.  For  outputs  that  don't  have
                               B-frames,  the  time  stamps in your DASH mani-
                               fests start at zero regardless of  your  choice
                               here.

                            SegmentControl -> (string)
                               When  set  to SINGLE_FILE, a single output file
                               is generated,  which  is  internally  segmented
                               using  the  Fragment Length and Segment Length.
                               When set to SEGMENTED_FILES,  separate  segment
                               files will be created.

                            SegmentLength -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  length, in whole seconds, of each
                               segment. When you don't specify a value, Media-
                               Convert  defaults  to 30. Related settings: Use
                               Segment length  control  (SegmentLengthControl)
                               to  specify  whether  the encoder enforces this
                               value    strictly.    Use    Segment    control
                               (DashIsoSegmentControl)   to   specify  whether
                               MediaConvert creates separate segment files  or
                               one  content file that has metadata to mark the
                               segment boundaries.

                            SegmentLengthControl -> (string)
                               Specify how you want MediaConvert to  determine
                               the  segment  length.  Choose  Exact (EXACT) to
                               have the encoder use the exact length that  you
                               specify  with  the setting Segment length (Seg-
                               mentLength).  This  might   result   in   extra
                               I-frames. Choose Multiple of GOP (GOP_MULTIPLE)
                               to  have  the  encoder  round  up  the  segment
                               lengths to match the next GOP boundary.

                            WriteSegmentTimelineInRepresentation -> (string)
                               If  you get an HTTP error in the 400 range when
                               you play back your  DASH  output,  enable  this
                               setting  and  run  your  transcoding job again.
                               When  you  enable  this  setting,  the  service
                               writes  precise  segment  durations in the DASH
                               manifest.  The  segment  duration   information
                               appears  inside  the  SegmentTimeline  element,
                               inside SegmentTemplate  at  the  Representation
                               level.  When you don't enable this setting, the
                               service writes approximate segment durations in
                               your DASH manifest.

                        FileGroupSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings related to your File output group. Media-
                            Convert uses this group of settings to generate  a
                            single  standalone  file,  rather than a streaming
                            package. When you work directly in your  JSON  job
                            specification,   include   this   object  and  any
                            required children when you set Type, under Output-
                            GroupSettings, to FILE_GROUP_SETTINGS.

                            Destination -> (string)
                               Use Destination (Destination) to specify the S3
                               output location and the output  filename  base.
                               Destination  accepts format identifiers. If you
                               do not specify the base filename  in  the  URI,
                               the  service will use the filename of the input
                               file. If your job has multiple inputs, the ser-
                               vice uses the filename of the first input file.

                            DestinationSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings associated with the destination.  Will
                               vary based on the type of destination

                               S3Settings -> (structure)
                                   Settings associated with S3 destination

                                   AccessControl -> (structure)
                                      Optional.  Have  MediaConvert  automati-
                                      cally apply Amazon S3 access control for
                                      the  outputs  in this output group. When
                                      you don't use this setting, S3 automati-
                                      cally applies the default access control
                                      list PRIVATE.

                                      CannedAcl -> (string)
                                          Choose an Amazon S3 canned  ACL  for
                                          MediaConvert  to  apply to this out-

                                   Encryption -> (structure)
                                      Settings for how your  job  outputs  are
                                      encrypted as they are uploaded to Amazon

                                      EncryptionType -> (string)
                                          Specify how you want your data  keys
                                          managed.   AWS  uses  data  keys  to
                                          encrypt  your  content.   AWS   also
                                          encrypts  the  data keys themselves,
                                          using a customer master  key  (CMK),
                                          and  then  stores the encrypted data
                                          keys alongside your  encrypted  con-
                                          tent.  Use  this  setting to specify
                                          which AWS service manages  the  CMK.
                                          For  simplest  set up, choose Amazon
                                          S3  (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_S3).  If
                                          you  want your master key to be man-
                                          aged by AWS Key  Management  Service
                                          (KMS),      choose      AWS      KMS
                                          (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).     By
                                          default,  when  you  choose AWS KMS,
                                          KMS uses the  AWS  managed  customer
                                          master  key  (CMK)  associated  with
                                          Amazon S3 to encrypt your data keys.
                                          You can optionally choose to specify
                                          a different, customer  managed  CMK.
                                          Do   so  by  specifying  the  Amazon
                                          Resource Name (ARN) of the  key  for
                                          the setting KMS ARN (kmsKeyArn).

                                      KmsEncryptionContext -> (string)
                                          Optionally,  specify  the encryption
                                          context that you want to use  along-
                                          side your KMS key. AWS KMS uses this
                                          encryption  context  as   additional
                                          authenticated  data (AAD) to support
                                          authenticated encryption. This value
                                          must   be   a  base64-encoded  UTF-8
                                          string holding JSON which represents
                                          a  string-string  map.  To  use this
                                          setting,   you   must    also    set
                                          Server-side   encryption  (S3Server-
                                          SideEncryptionType)   to   AWS   KMS
                                          (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).    For
                                          more  information  about  encryption

                                      KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                                          Optionally,   specify  the  customer
                                          master key (CMK) that  you  want  to
                                          use to encrypt the data key that AWS
                                          uses to encrypt your output content.
                                          Enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                                          of the CMK. To use this setting, you
                                          must also set Server-side encryption
                                          (S3ServerSideEncryptionType) to  AWS
                                          KMS (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS). If
                                          you set  Server-side  encryption  to
                                          AWS  KMS  but  don't  specify  a CMK
                                          here, AWS uses the AWS  managed  CMK
                                          associated with Amazon S3.

                        HlsGroupSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings  related  to your HLS output package. For

                            tion,  include  this object and any required chil-
                            dren when you set Type, under OutputGroupSettings,
                            to HLS_GROUP_SETTINGS.

                            AdMarkers -> (list)
                               Choose  one or more ad marker types to decorate
                               your Apple HLS manifest. This setting does  not
                               determine whether SCTE-35 markers appear in the
                               outputs themselves.

                            AdditionalManifests -> (list)
                               By default, the service creates  one  top-level
                               .m3u8 HLS manifest for each HLS output group in
                               your  job.  This  default  manifest  references
                               every  output  in  the  output group. To create
                               additional top-level manifests that reference a
                               subset  of  the  outputs  in  the output group,
                               specify a list of them here.

                               (structure)
                                   Specify the details for each additional HLS
                                   manifest  that you want the service to gen-
                                   erate for this output group. Each  manifest
                                   can reference a different subset of outputs
                                   in the group.

                                   ManifestNameModifier -> (string)
                                      Specify a name modifier that the service
                                      adds  to  the  name  of this manifest to
                                      make it different from the file names of
                                      the  other  main manifests in the output
                                      group. For example, say that the default
                                      main  manifest  for  your  HLS  group is
                                      film-name.m3u8. If you  enter  "-no-pre-
                                      mium"  for  this  setting, then the file
                                      name  the  service  generates  for  this
                                      top-level  manifest is film-name-no-pre-
                                      mium.m3u8. For HLS output groups,  spec-
                                      ify  a manifestNameModifier that is dif-
                                      ferent from the nameModifier of the out-
                                      put.  The  service  uses the output name
                                      modifier to create unique names for  the
                                      individual variant manifests.

                            ClientCache -> (string)
                               Disable this setting only  when  your  workflow
                               requires  the #EXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:no tag. Other-

                               Destination accepts format identifiers. If  you
                               do  not  specify  the base filename in the URI,
                               the service will use the filename of the  input
                               file. If your job has multiple inputs, the ser-
                               vice uses the filename of the first input file.

                            DestinationSettings -> (structure)

                                          Specify  how you want your data keys
                                          managed.  AWS  uses  data  keys   to
                                          encrypt   your   content.  AWS  also
                                          encrypts the data  keys  themselves,
                                          using  a  customer master key (CMK),
                                          and then stores the  encrypted  data
                                          keys  alongside  your encrypted con-
                                          tent. Use this  setting  to  specify
                                          which  AWS  service manages the CMK.
                                          For simplest set up,  choose  Amazon
                                          S3  (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_S3).  If
                                          you want your master key to be  man-
                                          aged  by  AWS Key Management Service
                                          (KMS),      choose      AWS      KMS
                                          (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).     By
                                          default, when you  choose  AWS  KMS,
                                          KMS  uses  the  AWS managed customer
                                          master  key  (CMK)  associated  with
                                          Amazon S3 to encrypt your data keys.
                                          You can optionally choose to specify
                                          a  different,  customer managed CMK.
                                          Do  so  by  specifying  the   Amazon
                                          Resource  Name  (ARN) of the key for
                                          the setting KMS ARN (kmsKeyArn).

                                      KmsEncryptionContext -> (string)
                                          Optionally, specify  the  encryption
                                          context  that you want to use along-
                                          side your KMS key. AWS KMS uses this
                                          encryption   context  as  additional
                                          authenticated data (AAD) to  support
                                          authenticated encryption. This value
                                          must  be  a   base64-encoded   UTF-8
                                          string holding JSON which represents
                                          a string-string  map.  To  use  this
                                          setting,    you    must   also   set
                                          Server-side  encryption   (S3Server-
                                          SideEncryptionType)   to   AWS   KMS
                                          (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).    For

                                      KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                                          Optionally,  specify  the   customer
                                          master  key  (CMK)  that you want to
                                          use to encrypt the data key that AWS
                                          uses to encrypt your output content.
                                          Enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                                          of the CMK. To use this setting, you
                                          must also set Server-side encryption
                                          (S3ServerSideEncryptionType)  to AWS
                                          KMS (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS). If
                                          you  set  Server-side  encryption to
                                          AWS KMS  but  don't  specify  a  CMK
                                          here,  AWS  uses the AWS managed CMK
                                          associated with Amazon S3.

                            DirectoryStructure -> (string)
                               Indicates whether segments should be placed  in
                               subdirectories.

                               ConstantInitializationVector -> (string)
                                   This is a 128-bit, 16-byte hex value repre-
                                   sented by a 32-character  text  string.  If
                                   this parameter is not set then the Initial-
                                   ization Vector will follow the segment num-
                                   ber by default.

                               EncryptionMethod -> (string)
                                   Encrypts   the   segments  with  the  given
                                   encryption scheme. Leave blank to  disable.
                                   Selecting  'Disabled'  in the web interface
                                   also disables encryption.

                               InitializationVectorInManifest -> (string)
                                   The Initialization Vector is a 128-bit num-
                                   ber  used  in  conjunction with the key for
                                   encrypting blocks. If set to INCLUDE,  Ini-
                                   tialization  Vector  is listed in the mani-
                                   fest. Otherwise  Initialization  Vector  is
                                   not in the manifest.

                               OfflineEncrypted -> (string)
                                   Enable   this   setting   to   insert   the
                                   EXT-X-SESSION-KEY element into  the  master
                                   playlist. This allows for offline Apple HLS
                                   FairPlay content protection.

                               SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)
                                   If your output group type is HLS, DASH,  or
                                   Microsoft  Smooth,  use these settings when
                                   doing DRM encryption with a SPEKE-compliant
                                   key  provider. If your output group type is

                                   IDR  frame  in the output (matching the GOP
                                   cadence). If set to  FOLLOW_CUSTOM,  Media-
                                   Convert  generates  thumbnails according to
                                   the interval you specify in thumbnailInter-
                                   val.

                               ThumbnailHeight -> (integer)
                                   Height  of  each thumbnail within each tile
                                   image, in pixels. Leave blank  to  maintain
                                   aspect  ratio with thumbnail width. If fol-
                                   lowing the aspect ratio  would  lead  to  a
                                   total  tile  height greater than 4096, then
                                   the job will be rejected. Must be divisible
                                   by 2.

                               ThumbnailInterval -> (double)
                                   Enter the interval, in seconds, that Media-
                                   Convert uses to generate thumbnails. If the
                                   interval  you  enter doesn't align with the
                                   output frame rate,  MediaConvert  automati-
                                   cally rounds the interval to align with the
                                   output frame rate. For example, if the out-
                                   put  frame  rate is 29.97 frames per second
                                   and you enter 5, MediaConvert  uses  a  150
                                   frame interval to generate thumbnails.

                               ThumbnailWidth -> (integer)
                                   Width  of  each  thumbnail within each tile
                                   image, in pixels. Default is 312.  Must  be
                                   divisible by 8.

                               TileHeight -> (integer)
                                   Number  of  thumbnails  in each column of a
                                   tile image. Set a value between 2 and 2048.
                                   Must be divisible by 2.

                               TileWidth -> (integer)
                                   Number  of thumbnails in each row of a tile
                                   image. Set a value between 1 and 512.

                            ManifestCompression -> (string)

                            ManifestDurationFormat -> (string)
                               Indicates whether the  output  manifest  should
                               use floating point values for segment duration.

                            MinFinalSegmentLength -> (double)
                               Keep this setting at the default  value  of  0,
                               unless  you  are troubleshooting a problem with
                               how devices play back the  end  of  your  video
                               asset.  If  you  know  that  player devices are
                               hanging on the  final  segment  of  your  video
                               because the length of your final segment is too
                               short, use this setting to  specify  a  minimum
                               final  segment  length,  in  seconds.  Choose a
                               value that is greater than or equal  to  1  and
                               less than your segment length. When you specify
                               a value for this setting, the encoder will com-
                               bine any final segment that is shorter than the
                               length that you specify with the previous  seg-
                               ment.  For  example,  your  segment length is 3
                               seconds and your final segment  is  .5  seconds
                               without  a  minimum  final segment length; when
                               you set the minimum final segment length to  1,
                               your final segment is 3.5 seconds.

                            MinSegmentLength -> (integer)
                               When  set,  Minimum Segment Size is enforced by
                               looking ahead and  back  within  the  specified
                               range for a nearby avail and extending the seg-
                               ment size if needed.

                            OutputSelection -> (string)
                               Indicates  whether  the  .m3u8  manifest   file
                               should  be generated for this HLS output group.

                            ProgramDateTime -> (string)
                               Includes  or  excludes  EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME
                               tag  in .m3u8 manifest files. The value is cal-
                               culated as follows: either the program date and
                               time  are  initialized using the input timecode
                               source, or the time is  initialized  using  the
                               input  timecode source and the date is initial-
                               ized using the timestamp_offset.

                            ProgramDateTimePeriod -> (integer)
                               Period of insertion of  EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME
                               entry, in seconds.

                            SegmentControl -> (string)
                               When  set  to  SINGLE_FILE,  emits program as a
                               single  media   resource   (.ts)   file,   uses
                               #EXT-X-BYTERANGE  tags  to  index  segment  for
                               playback.

                            SegmentLength -> (integer)
                               Specify the length, in whole seconds,  of  each
                               segment. When you don't specify a value, Media-
                               Convert defaults to 10. Related  settings:  Use
                               Segment  length  control (SegmentLengthControl)
                               to specify whether the  encoder  enforces  this
                               value  strictly.  Use  Segment control (HlsSeg-
                               mentControl) to  specify  whether  MediaConvert
                               creates  separate  segment files or one content
                               file that has  metadata  to  mark  the  segment

                            SegmentLengthControl -> (string)
                               Specify  how you want MediaConvert to determine
                               the segment length.  Choose  Exact  (EXACT)  to
                               have  the encoder use the exact length that you
                               specify with the setting Segment  length  (Seg-
                               mentLength).   This   might   result  in  extra
                               I-frames. Choose Multiple of GOP (GOP_MULTIPLE)
                               to  have  the  encoder  round  up  the  segment
                               lengths to match the next GOP boundary.

                            SegmentsPerSubdirectory -> (integer)
                               Number of segments to write to  a  subdirectory

                            StreamInfResolution -> (string)
                               Include  or  exclude  RESOLUTION  attribute for
                               video in EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag of variant  mani-
                               fest.

                            TargetDurationCompatibilityMode -> (string)
                               When set to LEGACY, the segment target duration
                               is always rounded up  to  the  nearest  integer
                               value  above its current value in seconds. When
                               set  to  SPEC\_COMPLIANT,  the  segment  target
                               duration  is  rounded up to the nearest integer
                               value if fraction seconds are greater  than  or
                               equal  to 0.5 (>= 0.5) and rounded down if less
                               than 0.5 (<0.5). You may need to use LEGACY  if
                               your  client  needs  to  ensure that the target
                               duration is always longer than the actual dura-
                               tion  of  the  segment.  Some older players may
                               experience interrupted playback when the actual
                               duration of a track in a segment is longer than
                               the target duration.

                            TimedMetadataId3Frame -> (string)
                               Indicates ID3 frame that has the timecode.

                            TimedMetadataId3Period -> (integer)
                               Timed Metadata interval in seconds.

                            TimestampDeltaMilliseconds -> (integer)
                               Provides an extra millisecond delta  offset  to
                               fine tune the timestamps.

                        MsSmoothGroupSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings  related to your Microsoft Smooth Stream-

                            AdditionalManifests -> (list)
                               By   default,  the  service  creates  one  .ism
                               Microsoft Smooth Streaming  manifest  for  each
                               Microsoft Smooth Streaming output group in your
                               job. This  default  manifest  references  every
                               output  in  the  output  group. To create addi-
                               tional manifests that reference a subset of the
                               outputs  in the output group, specify a list of
                               them here.

                               (structure)
                                   Specify the  details  for  each  additional
                                   Microsoft  Smooth  Streaming  manifest that
                                   you want the service to generate  for  this
                                   output group. Each manifest can reference a
                                   different subset of outputs in the group.

                                   ManifestNameModifier -> (string)
                                      Specify a name modifier that the service
                                      adds  to  the  name  of this manifest to
                                      make it different from the file names of
                                      the  other  main manifests in the output
                                      group. For example, say that the default
                                      main  manifest for your Microsoft Smooth
                                      group is film-name.ismv.  If  you  enter
                                      "-no-premium" for this setting, then the
                                      file name the service generates for this
                                      top-level  manifest is film-name-no-pre-
                                      mium.ismv.

                                   SelectedOutputs -> (list)
                                      Specify the outputs that you  want  this
                                      additional  top-level manifest to refer-

                            AudioDeduplication -> (string)
                               COMBINE_DUPLICATE_STREAMS  combines   identical
                               audio  encoding  settings  across  a  Microsoft
                               Smooth output group into a single audio stream.

                            Destination -> (string)
                               Use Destination (Destination) to specify the S3
                               output location and the output  filename  base.
                               Destination  accepts format identifiers. If you
                               do not specify the base filename  in  the  URI,
                               the  service will use the filename of the input
                               file. If your job has multiple inputs, the ser-
                               vice uses the filename of the first input file.

                            DestinationSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings associated with the destination.  Will
                               vary based on the type of destination

                               S3Settings -> (structure)
                                   Settings associated with S3 destination

                                   AccessControl -> (structure)
                                      Optional.  Have  MediaConvert  automati-

                                      the  outputs  in this output group. When
                                      you don't use this setting, S3 automati-
                                      cally applies the default access control

                                      CannedAcl -> (string)
                                          Choose an Amazon S3 canned  ACL  for
                                          MediaConvert  to  apply to this out-

                                   Encryption -> (structure)
                                      Settings for how your  job  outputs  are
                                      encrypted as they are uploaded to Amazon

                                      EncryptionType -> (string)
                                          Specify how you want your data  keys
                                          managed.   AWS  uses  data  keys  to
                                          encrypt  your  content.   AWS   also
                                          encrypts  the  data keys themselves,
                                          using a customer master  key  (CMK),
                                          and  then  stores the encrypted data
                                          keys alongside your  encrypted  con-
                                          tent.  Use  this  setting to specify
                                          which AWS service manages  the  CMK.
                                          For  simplest  set up, choose Amazon
                                          S3  (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_S3).  If
                                          you  want your master key to be man-
                                          aged by AWS Key  Management  Service
                                          (KMS),      choose      AWS      KMS
                                          (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).     By
                                          default,  when  you  choose AWS KMS,
                                          KMS uses the  AWS  managed  customer
                                          master  key  (CMK)  associated  with
                                          Amazon S3 to encrypt your data keys.
                                          You can optionally choose to specify
                                          a different, customer  managed  CMK.
                                          Do   so  by  specifying  the  Amazon
                                          Resource Name (ARN) of the  key  for
                                          the setting KMS ARN (kmsKeyArn).

                                      KmsEncryptionContext -> (string)
                                          Optionally,  specify  the encryption
                                          context that you want to use  along-
                                          side your KMS key. AWS KMS uses this
                                          encryption  context  as   additional
                                          authenticated  data (AAD) to support
                                          authenticated encryption. This value
                                          must   be   a  base64-encoded  UTF-8
                                          string holding JSON which represents
                                          a  string-string  map.  To  use this
                                          setting,   you   must    also    set
                                          Server-side   encryption  (S3Server-
                                          SideEncryptionType)   to   AWS   KMS
                                          (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).    For
                                          more  information  about  encryption
                                          context,                        see:

                                      KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                                          Optionally,   specify  the  customer
                                          master key (CMK) that  you  want  to
                                          use to encrypt the data key that AWS
                                          uses to encrypt your output content.
                                          Enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                                          of the CMK. To use this setting, you
                                          must also set Server-side encryption
                                          (S3ServerSideEncryptionType) to  AWS
                                          KMS (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS). If
                                          you set  Server-side  encryption  to
                                          AWS  KMS  but  don't  specify  a CMK
                                          here, AWS uses the AWS  managed  CMK
                                          associated with Amazon S3.

                            Encryption -> (structure)
                               If  you  are  using  DRM,  set DRM System (MsS-
                               moothEncryptionSettings) to specify  the  value
                               SpekeKeyProvider.

                               SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)
                                   If  your output group type is HLS, DASH, or
                                   Microsoft Smooth, use these  settings  when
                                   doing DRM encryption with a SPEKE-compliant
                                   key provider. If your output group type  is
                                   CMAF, use the SpekeKeyProviderCmaf settings
                                   instead.

                                   CertificateArn -> (string)
                                      If you want your key provider to encrypt
                                      the  content  keys  that  it provides to
                                      MediaConvert, set up a certificate  with
                                      a  master key using AWS Certificate Man-
                                      ager. Specify the  certificate's  Amazon

                        (structure)
                            Each output in your job is a  collection  of  set-
                            tings  that describes how you want MediaConvert to
                            encode a single output file or  stream.  For  more
                            information,                                   see

                            AudioDescriptions -> (list)
                               (AudioDescriptions)  contains  groups  of audio
                               encoding settings  organized  by  audio  codec.
                               Include one instance of (AudioDescriptions) per
                               output. (AudioDescriptions) can contain  multi-
                               ple groups of encoding settings.

                               (structure)
                                   Settings  related  to  one audio tab on the
                                   MediaConvert console. In your job JSON,  an
                                   instance  of AudioDescription is equivalent
                                   to one audio tab in the  console.  Usually,
                                   one  audio  tab  corresponds  to one output
                                   audio track. Depending on how  you  set  up
                                   your  input audio selectors and whether you
                                   use audio selector groups,  one  audio  tab
                                   can  correspond  to a group of output audio
                                   tracks.

                                   AudioChannelTaggingSettings -> (structure)
                                      When you  mimic  a  multi-channel  audio
                                      layout    with   multiple   mono-channel
                                      tracks, you can tag each channel  layout
                                      manually. For example, you would tag the
                                      tracks that contain  your  left,  right,
                                      and  center  audio  with Left (L), Right
                                      (R), and Center (C), respectively.  When
                                      you  don't specify a value, MediaConvert
                                      labels  your  track  as  Center  (C)  by
                                      default.  To  use  audio layout tagging,
                                      your  output  must  be  in  a  QuickTime
                                      (.mov)  container; your audio codec must
                                      be AAC, WAV, or AIFF; and you  must  set
                                      up  your  audio  track  to have only one
                                      channel.

                                      ChannelTag -> (string)
                                          You  can  add   a   tag   for   this
                                          mono-channel  audio  track  to mimic
                                          its  placement  in  a  multi-channel
                                          layout.  For  example, if this track
                                          is the left surround channel, choose
                                          Left surround (LS).

                                   AudioNormalizationSettings -> (structure)
                                      Advanced  audio  normalization settings.
                                      Ignore these settings unless you need to
                                      comply with a loudness standard.

                                   CodecSettings -> (structure)
                                      Settings  related to audio encoding. The
                                      settings in this group vary depending on
                                      the value that you choose for your audio
                                      codec.

                                      AacSettings -> (structure)
                                          Required when you set (Codec)  under

                                          to  the  value  AAC.   The   service
                                          accepts  one  of two mutually exclu-
                                          sive groups of AAC settings--VBR and
                                          CBR.  To  select one of these modes,
                                          set the  value  of  Bitrate  control
                                          mode  (rateControlMode)  to "VBR" or
                                          "CBR". In VBR mode, you control  the

                                          quality (vbrQuality). In  CBR  mode,
                                          you    use   the   setting   Bitrate
                                          (bitrate). Defaults and valid values
                                          depend on the rate control mode.

                                             must contain pre-mixed audio; the

                                             In this case,  the  encoder  will
                                             use  any  values  you provide for

                                      figured  (USE_CONFIGURED).  The  service
                                      also uses your specified custom language
                                      code when you set Language code  control
                                      (AudioLanguageCodeControl)   to   Follow
                                      input  (FOLLOW_INPUT),  but  your  input
                                      file  doesn't  specify  a language code.
                                      For all outputs,  you  can  use  an  ISO
                                      639-2  or  ISO 639-3 code. For streaming
                                      outputs, you can also use any other code
                                      in   the  full  RFC-5646  specification.
                                      Streaming outputs are those that are  in
                                      one  of  the  following  output  groups:
                                      CMAF, DASH ISO, Apple HLS, or  Microsoft

                                      present.  If  there's no languge code on
                                      the input track, the  service  uses  the
                                      code  that  you  specify  in the setting

                                   These settings relate to the fragmented MP4

                                   AudioDuration -> (string)
                                      Specify this setting only when your out-
                                      put will be  consumed  by  a  downstream
                                      repackaging  workflow  that is sensitive
                                      to  very  small   duration   differences
                                      between video and audio. For this situa-
                                      tion,  choose   Match   video   duration
                                      (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION).   In  all  other
                                      cases, keep the default  value,  Default
                                      codec duration (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION).
                                      When you choose  Match  video  duration,
                                      MediaConvert   pads   the  output  audio
                                      streams with silence or  trims  them  to
                                      ensure  that  the total duration of each
                                      audio stream is at least as long as  the
                                      total  duration  of  the  video  stream.
                                      After padding  or  trimming,  the  audio
                                      stream  duration  is  no  more  than one
                                      frame  longer  than  the  video  stream.
                                      MediaConvert  applies  audio  padding or
                                      trimming only to the  end  of  the  last
                                      segment  of  the output. For unsegmented
                                      outputs, MediaConvert adds padding  only
                                      to  the  end  of the file. When you keep
                                      the default value, any minor  discrepan-
                                      cies  between  audio  and video duration
                                      will depend on your output audio  codec.

                                   AudioGroupId -> (string)
                                      Specify  the  audio  rendition group for
                                      this audio rendition. Specify up to  one
                                      value for each audio output in your out-
                                      put group. This value  appears  in  your

                                      tag of TYPE=AUDIO, as the value for  the
                                      GROUP-ID  attribute. For example, if you
                                      specify "audio_aac_1"  for  Audio  group
                                      ID,  it  appears  in  your manifest like
                                      this:

                                   AudioRenditionSets -> (string)
                                      List the audio rendition groups that you
                                      want included with this video rendition.
                                      Use a comma-separated list. For example,
                                      say you want to include the audio rendi-
                                      tion  groups  that  have the audio group
                                      IDs  "audio_aac_1"  and   "audio_dolby".
                                      Then   you  would  specify  this  value:
                                      "audio_aac_1,audio_dolby". Related  set-

                                      and associates it with every video vari-
                                      ant. Each value in your list appears  in
                                      your   HLS   parent   manifest   in  the
                                      EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag as  the  value  for
                                      the  AUDIO  attribute.  To  continue the
                                      previous example, say that the file name

                                      rendition   is   "amazing_video_1.m3u8".
                                      Then,  in  your  parent  manifest,  each
                                      value will  appear  on  separate  lines,
                                      like                               this:

                                   AudioTrackType -> (string)
                                      Use  this  setting to control the values
                                      that MediaConvert puts in your HLS  par-

                                      determine the values  that  MediaConvert
                                      writes  for  the  DEFAULT and AUTOSELECT
                                      attributes of the EXT-X-MEDIA entry  for

                                   Container for this output. Some  containers
                                   require a container settings object. If not
                                   specified, the default object will be  cre-
                                   ated.

                               F4vSettings -> (structure)

                                   MoovPlacement -> (string)
                                      If set to PROGRESSIVE_DOWNLOAD, the MOOV
                                      atom is relocated to  the  beginning  of
                                      the  archive as required for progressive
                                      downloading. Otherwise it is placed nor-

                               M2tsSettings -> (structure)
                                   MPEG-2  TS  container settings. These apply
                                   to outputs in a File output group when  the
                                   output's   container   (ContainerType)   is
                                   MPEG-2 Transport Stream  (M2TS).  In  these
                                   assets,  data  is  organized by the program
                                   map table (PMT). Each transport stream pro-
                                   gram  contains  subsets  of data, including
                                   audio, video, and metadata. Each  of  these
                                   subsets  of  data  has  a  numerical  label
                                   called  a  packet  identifier  (PID).  Each
                                   transport stream program corresponds to one
                                   MediaConvert  output.  The  PMT  lists  the
                                   types of data in a program along with their
                                   PID. Downstream systems and players use the
                                   program  map  table  to look up the PID for
                                   each type of data it accesses and then uses
                                   the PIDs to locate specific data within the
                                   asset.

                                   AudioBufferModel -> (string)
                                      Selects between the DVB and ATSC  buffer
                                      models for Dolby Digital audio.

                                   AudioDuration -> (string)
                                      Specify this setting only when your out-
                                      put will be  consumed  by  a  downstream
                                      repackaging  workflow  that is sensitive
                                      to  very  small   duration   differences
                                      between video and audio. For this situa-
                                      tion,  choose   Match   video   duration
                                      (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION).   In  all  other
                                      cases, keep the default  value,  Default
                                      codec duration (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION).
                                      When you choose  Match  video  duration,
                                      MediaConvert   pads   the  output  audio
                                      streams with silence or  trims  them  to
                                      ensure  that  the total duration of each
                                      audio stream is at least as long as  the
                                      total  duration  of  the  video  stream.
                                      After padding  or  trimming,  the  audio
                                      stream  duration  is  no  more  than one
                                      frame  longer  than  the  video  stream.
                                      MediaConvert  applies  audio  padding or
                                      trimming only to the  end  of  the  last
                                      segment  of  the output. For unsegmented
                                      outputs, MediaConvert adds padding  only
                                      to  the  end  of the file. When you keep
                                      the default value, any minor  discrepan-
                                      cies  between  audio  and video duration
                                      will depend on your output audio  codec.

                                   AudioFramesPerPes -> (integer)
                                      The number of audio frames to insert for
                                      each PES packet.

                                   AudioPids -> (list)
                                      Specify the  packet  identifiers  (PIDs)
                                      for  any  elementary  audio  streams you
                                      include in this output. Specify multiple
                                      PIDs  as  a  JSON  array. Default is the
                                      range 482-492.

                                      (integer)

                                   Bitrate -> (integer)
                                      Specify the output bitrate of the trans-
                                      port  stream in bits per second. Setting
                                      to 0 lets the muxer automatically deter-
                                      mine the appropriate bitrate. Other com-
                                      mon values  are  3750000,  7500000,  and
                                      15000000.

                                   BufferModel -> (string)
                                      Controls  what  buffer  model to use for
                                      accurate interleaving. If set to  MULTI-
                                      PLEX, use multiplex buffer model. If set
                                      to NONE, this can lead to lower latency,
                                      but  low-memory  devices may not be able
                                      to play back the stream  without  inter-
                                      ruptions.

                                      with Presentation Timestamp (PTS) values
                                      greater than or equal to the first video
                                      packet  PTS (MediaConvert drops captions
                                      and data packets with  lesser  PTS  val-
                                      ues).  Keep  the default value (AUTO) to
                                      allow all PTS values.

                                      M2tsSettings.

                                      TdtInterval -> (integer)
                                          The  number  of milliseconds between
                                          instances of this table in the  out-
                                          put transport stream.

                                   DvbTeletextPid -> (integer)
                                      Specify  the packet identifier (PID) for
                                      DVB teletext data you  include  in  this
                                      output. Default is 499.

                                   EbpAudioInterval -> (string)
                                      When  set  to VIDEO_AND_FIXED_INTERVALS,
                                      audio EBP markers will be added to  par-
                                      titions  3  and  4. The interval between
                                      these additional markers will be  fixed,
                                      and  will  be  slightly shorter than the
                                      video EBP marker interval. When  set  to
                                      VIDEO_INTERVAL, these additional markers
                                      will not be  inserted.  Only  applicable
                                      when  EBP  segmentation  markers  are is
                                      selected (segmentationMarkers is EBP  or
                                      EBP_LEGACY).

                                   EbpPlacement -> (string)
                                      Selects  which PIDs to place EBP markers
                                      on. They can either be  placed  only  on
                                      the  video PID, or on both the video PID
                                      and all audio PIDs. Only applicable when
                                      EBP segmentation markers are is selected
                                      (segmentationMarkers    is    EBP     or
                                      EBP_LEGACY).

                                   EsRateInPes -> (string)
                                      Controls  whether to include the ES Rate
                                      field in the PES header.

                                   ForceTsVideoEbpOrder -> (string)
                                      Keep the default value (DEFAULT)  unless
                                      you know that your audio EBP markers are
                                      incorrectly appearing before your  video
                                      EBP  markers.  To  correct this problem,
                                      set this value to Force (FORCE).

                                   FragmentTime -> (double)
                                      The length, in seconds,  of  each  frag-
                                      ment. Only used with EBP markers.

                                   MaxPcrInterval -> (integer)
                                      Specify  the  maximum time, in millisec-
                                      onds, between Program  Clock  References
                                      (PCRs)   inserted   into  the  transport
                                      stream.

                                   MinEbpInterval -> (integer)
                                      When set, enforces that Encoder Boundary
                                      Points  do not come within the specified
                                      time interval of each other  by  looking
                                      ahead  at input video. If another EBP is
                                      going to come in  within  the  specified
                                      time  interval,  the  current EBP is not
                                      emitted, and the segment is  "stretched"
                                      to  the next marker. The lookahead value
                                      does not add latency to the system.  The
                                      Live  Event must be configured elsewhere
                                      to create sufficient latency to make the
                                      lookahead accurate.

                                   NielsenId3 -> (string)
                                      If  INSERT,  Nielsen inaudible tones for
                                      media tracking will be detected  in  the
                                      input  audio  and  an equivalent ID3 tag
                                      will be inserted in the output.

                                   NullPacketBitrate -> (double)
                                      Value in bits per second of  extra  null
                                      packets  to  insert  into  the transport
                                      stream. This can be used if a downstream
                                      encryption system requires periodic null
                                      packets.

                                   PatInterval -> (integer)
                                      The  number  of   milliseconds   between

                                      transport stream.

                                   PcrControl -> (string)
                                      When set to PCR_EVERY_PES_PACKET, a Pro-
                                      gram  Clock  Reference value is inserted
                                      for every Packetized  Elementary  Stream
                                      (PES)  header.  This  is  effective only
                                      when the PCR PID  is  the  same  as  the
                                      video or audio elementary stream.

                                   PcrPid -> (integer)
                                      Specify  the packet identifier (PID) for
                                      the program  clock  reference  (PCR)  in
                                      this  output.  If  you  do not specify a
                                      value, the service will  use  the  value
                                      for Video PID (VideoPid).

                                   PmtInterval -> (integer)
                                      Specify   the   number  of  milliseconds
                                      between instances of the program map ta-
                                      ble   (PMT)   in  the  output  transport
                                      stream.

                                   PmtPid -> (integer)
                                      Specify the packet identifier (PID)  for
                                      the  program  map  table  (PMT)  itself.
                                      Default is 480.

                                   PrivateMetadataPid -> (integer)
                                      Specify the packet identifier  (PID)  of
                                      the  private metadata stream. Default is
                                      503.

                                   ProgramNumber -> (integer)
                                      Use Program  number  (programNumber)  to
                                      specify  the  program number used in the
                                      program map table (PMT) for this output.
                                      Default  is  1. Program numbers and pro-
                                      gram map  tables  are  parts  of  MPEG-2
                                      transport  stream  containers,  used for
                                      organizing data.

                                   RateMode -> (string)
                                      When set to CBR,  inserts  null  packets
                                      into  transport stream to fill specified
                                      bitrate. When set to  VBR,  the  bitrate
                                      setting acts as the maximum bitrate, but
                                      the output will not be padded up to that
                                      bitrate.

                                   SegmentationMarkers -> (string)
                                      Inserts  segmentation  markers  at  each
                                      segmentation_time  period.  rai_segstart
                                      sets  the Random Access Indicator bit in
                                      the adaptation field. rai_adapt sets the
                                      RAI bit and adds the current timecode in
                                      the  private  data  bytes.  psi_segstart
                                      inserts  PAT and PMT tables at the start
                                      of segments. ebp adds  Encoder  Boundary

                                   SegmentationStyle -> (string)
                                      The segmentation  style  parameter  con-
                                      trols   how   segmentation  markers  are
                                      inserted into the transport stream. With
                                      avails, it is possible that segments may
                                      be truncated, which can influence  where
                                      future    segmentation    markers    are
                                      inserted. When a segmentation  style  of

                                      ment is truncated due to  an  avail,  we
                                      will  reset  the  segmentation  cadence.
                                      This means the subsequent  segment  will
                                      have a duration of of $segmentation_time
                                      seconds. When a  segmentation  style  of

                                      will not reset the segmentation cadence.
                                      This means the subsequent  segment  will
                                      likely  be  truncated  as well. However,
                                      all segments  after  that  will  have  a

                                   SegmentationTime -> (double)
                                      Specify  the length, in seconds, of each
                                      segment. Required unless markers is  set
                                      to _none_.

                                   TimedMetadataPid -> (integer)
                                      Specify  the packet identifier (PID) for
                                      timed metadata in this  output.  Default

                                      itself in the program map table for this
                                      output. Transport stream IDs and program
                                      map tables are parts of MPEG-2 transport
                                      stream  containers,  used for organizing
                                      data.

                                   VideoPid -> (integer)
                                      Specify the packet identifier  (PID)  of
                                      the   elementary  video  stream  in  the
                                      transport stream.

                               M3u8Settings -> (structure)
                                   These settings relate to the MPEG-2  trans-
                                   port  stream  (MPEG2-TS)  container for the
                                   MPEG2-TS segments in your HLS outputs.

                                   AudioDuration -> (string)
                                      Specify this setting only when your out-
                                      put  will  be  consumed  by a downstream
                                      repackaging workflow that  is  sensitive
                                      to   very   small  duration  differences
                                      between video and audio. For this situa-
                                      tion,   choose   Match   video  duration
                                      (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION).  In  all   other
                                      cases,  keep  the default value, Default
                                      codec duration (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION).
                                      When  you  choose  Match video duration,
                                      MediaConvert  pads  the   output   audio
                                      streams  with  silence  or trims them to
                                      ensure that the total duration  of  each
                                      audio  stream is at least as long as the
                                      total  duration  of  the  video  stream.
                                      After  padding  or  trimming,  the audio
                                      stream duration  is  no  more  than  one
                                      frame  longer  than  the  video  stream.
                                      MediaConvert applies  audio  padding  or
                                      trimming  only  to  the  end of the last
                                      segment of the output.  For  unsegmented
                                      outputs,  MediaConvert adds padding only
                                      to the end of the file.  When  you  keep
                                      the  default value, any minor discrepan-
                                      cies between audio  and  video  duration
                                      will  depend on your output audio codec.

                                      stream.  Multiple  values  are accepted,
                                      and can be entered in ranges  and/or  by
                                      comma separation.

                                      (PES)  header.  This parameter is effec-
                                      tive only when the PCR PID is  the  same
                                      as the video or audio elementary stream.

                                      est) box will be  included  per  14496-1
                                      amendment 1. This improves compatibility
                                      with Apple players and tools.

                                   Mpeg2FourCCControl -> (string)
                                      When set to XDCAM,  writes  MPEG2  video
                                      streams  into  the  QuickTime file using
                                      XDCAM fourcc codes. This increases  com-
                                      patibility  with Apple editors and play-
                                      ers, but may decrease compatibility with
                                      other  players. Only applicable when the
                                      video codec is MPEG2.

                                   PaddingControl -> (string)
                                      To  make  this  output  compatible  with
                                      Omenon,  keep the default value, OMNEON.
                                      Unless you  need  Omneon  compatibility,
                                      set  this  value  to NONE. When you keep
                                      the default value, OMNEON,  MediaConvert
                                      increases  the  length  of the edit list
                                      atom. This might cause  file  rejections
                                      when  a  recipient  of  the  output file
                                      doesn't expct this extra padding.

                                   Reference -> (string)
                                      Always keep the default value (SELF_CON-
                                      TAINED) for this setting.

                               Mp4Settings -> (structure)
                                   These  settings  relate  to your MP4 output

                                   AudioDuration -> (string)
                                      Specify this setting only when your out-
                                      put  will  be  consumed  by a downstream
                                      repackaging workflow that  is  sensitive
                                      to   very   small  duration  differences
                                      between video and audio. For this situa-
                                      tion,   choose   Match   video  duration
                                      (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION).  In  all   other
                                      cases,  keep  the default value, Default
                                      codec duration (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION).
                                      When  you  choose  Match video duration,
                                      MediaConvert  pads  the   output   audio
                                      streams  with  silence  or trims them to
                                      ensure that the total duration  of  each
                                      audio  stream is at least as long as the
                                      total  duration  of  the  video  stream.
                                      After  padding  or  trimming,  the audio
                                      stream duration  is  no  more  than  one
                                      frame  longer  than  the  video  stream.
                                      MediaConvert applies  audio  padding  or
                                      trimming  only  to  the  end of the last
                                      segment of the output.  For  unsegmented
                                      outputs,  MediaConvert adds padding only
                                      to the end of the file.  When  you  keep
                                      the  default value, any minor discrepan-
                                      cies between audio  and  video  duration
                                      will  depend on your output audio codec.

                                      will start at zero, composition times in
                                      the 'ctts' (composition time to  sample)
                                      box for B-frames will be negative, and a

                                      est)  box  will  be included per 14496-1
                                      amendment 1. This improves compatibility
                                      with Apple players and tools.

                                   CttsVersion -> (integer)
                                      Ignore this setting unless compliance to
                                      the CTTS box version specification  mat-
                                      ters  in  your workflow. Specify a value
                                      of 1 to set your CTTS box version  to  1
                                      and  make your output compliant with the
                                      specification. When you specify a  value
                                      of  1, you must also set CSLG atom (csl-
                                      gAtom) to the value  INCLUDE.  Keep  the
                                      default  value  0  to  set your CTTS box
                                      version to 0. This can provide  backward
                                      compatibility for some players and pack-
                                      agers.

                                      required, but some video players require
                                      it to discover  and  play  embedded  608
                                      captions.   Keep   the   default  value,

                                      When you choose  Match  video  duration,
                                      MediaConvert   pads   the  output  audio

                                          1492 bytes per frame. This should be
                                          sufficient   to   prevent   overflow
                                          unless you have  multiple  pages  of
                                          teletext  captions data. If you have

                            NameModifier -> (string)
                               Use  Name  modifier  (NameModifier) to have the
                               service add a string to the end of each  output
                               filename. You specify the base filename as part
                               of your destination URI. When you create multi-
                               ple outputs in the same output group, Name mod-
                               ifier (NameModifier) is required. Name modifier
                               also  accepts  format identifiers. For DASH ISO
                               outputs, if  you  use  the  format  identifiers
                               $Number$  or $Time$ in one output, you must use

                                      value Exclude (EXCLUDE).

                                   SegmentModifier -> (string)
                                      Use this setting to add  an  identifying
                                      string  to the filename of each segment.
                                      The service adds this string between the
                                      name  modifier and segment index number.
                                      You can use format  identifiers  in  the
                                      string.   For   more   information,  see
                                      https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/using-variables-in-your-job-settings.html

                            Preset -> (string)
                               Use  Preset  (Preset)  to  specify a preset for
                               your transcoding settings. Provide  the  system
                               or  custom  preset name. You can specify either
                               Preset (Preset) or Container settings (Contain-
                               erSettings), but not both.

                            VideoDescription -> (structure)
                               VideoDescription  contains  a  group  of  video
                               encoding settings. The specific video  settings
                               depend  on  the video codec that you choose for
                               the property codec.  Include  one  instance  of
                               VideoDescription per output.

                               AfdSignaling -> (string)
                                   This  setting only applies to H.264, H.265,
                                   and MPEG2 outputs. Use Insert AFD signaling
                                   (AfdSignaling)  to specify whether the ser-
                                   vice includes  AFD  values  in  the  output
                                   video  data  and  what  those values are. *
                                   Choose None to remove all AFD  values  from
                                   this output. * Choose Fixed to ignore input
                                   AFD values and  instead  encode  the  value
                                   specified in the job. * Choose Auto to cal-
                                   culate output AFD values based on the input
                                   AFD scaler data.

                               AntiAlias -> (string)
                                   The   anti-alias  filter  is  automatically
                                   applied to  all  outputs.  The  service  no
                                   longer   accepts  the  value  DISABLED  for
                                   AntiAlias. If you specify that in your job,
                                   the service will ignore the setting.

                               CodecSettings -> (structure)
                                   Video codec settings, (CodecSettings) under
                                   (VideoDescription), contains the  group  of
                                   settings  related  to  video  encoding. The
                                   settings in this group  vary  depending  on
                                   the  value  that you choose for Video codec
                                   (Codec).  For  each  codec  enum  that  you
                                   choose,  define  the corresponding settings
                                   object. The following lists the codec enum,
                                   settings object pairs. * AV1, Av1Settings *
                                   AVC_INTRA,  AvcIntraSettings  *  FRAME_CAP-

                                   VC3, Vc3Settings * VP8, Vp8Settings *  VP9,
                                   Vp9Settings * XAVC, XavcSettings

                                   Av1Settings -> (structure)
                                      Required   when  you  set  Codec,  under
                                      VideoDescription>CodecSettings  to   the
                                      value AV1.

                                      AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                                          Specify the strength of any adaptive
                                          quantization   filters   that    you
                                          enable.  The  value  that you choose
                                          here  applies  to  Spatial  adaptive
                                          quantization (spatialAdaptiveQuanti-
                                          zation).

                                      BitDepth -> (string)
                                          Specify the Bit depth (Av1BitDepth).
                                          You  can  choose  8-bit  (BIT_8)  or
                                          10-bit (BIT_10).

                                      FramerateControl -> (string)
                                          If you are using  the  console,  use
                                          the Framerate setting to specify the
                                          frame rate for this output.  If  you
                                          want  to keep the same frame rate as
                                          the  input  video,   choose   Follow
                                          source. If you want to do frame rate
                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the  dropdown list or choose Custom.
                                          The framerates shown in the dropdown
                                          list  are  decimal approximations of
                                          fractions.  If  you  choose  Custom,
                                          specify  your  frame rate as a frac-
                                          tion.  If  you  are  creating   your
                                          transcoding  job  specification as a
                                          JSON file without the  console,  use
                                          FramerateControl  to  specify  which
                                          value the service uses for the frame
                                          rate  for  this  output. Choose INI-
                                          TIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE if you want  the
                                          service  to  use the frame rate from
                                          the input. Choose SPECIFIED  if  you
                                          want  the  service  to use the frame
                                          rate you  specify  in  the  settings
                                          FramerateNumerator  and FramerateDe-
                                          nominator.

                                      FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                          Choose  the  method  that  you  want
                                          MediaConvert to use when  increasing
                                          or  decreasing  the  frame  rate. We
                                          recommend   using   drop   duplicate
                                          (DUPLICATE_DROP)   for   numerically
                                          simple conversions, such as  60  fps
                                          to  30  fps. For numerically complex
                                          conversions, you can use interpolate
                                          (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This
                                          results in  a  smooth  picture,  but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts. For  complex  frame  rate
                                          conversions,   especially   if  your
                                          source video has already  been  con-
                                          verted  from  its  original cadence,
                                          use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to  do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion  method  frame  by  frame. Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding  time  and incurs a sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to  specify  the denominator of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use  1001
                                          for  the value of FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor. When you use  the  console  for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps.  Use  FramerateNumerator
                                          to  specify  the  numerator  of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When  you  use   the   console   for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      GopSize -> (double)
                                          Specify  the  GOP  length  (keyframe
                                          interval) in frames. With AV1, Medi-
                                          aConvert doesn't support GOP  length
                                          in   seconds.  This  value  must  be
                                          greater  than  zero  and  preferably
                                          equal  to 1 + ((numberBFrames + 1) *
                                          x), where x is an integer value.

                                      MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                          Maximum bitrate in bits/second.  For
                                          example,  enter  five  megabits  per

                                          codec. Use these settings only  when
                                          you  set  QVBR for Rate control mode
                                          (RateControlMode).

                                          QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                                             Use this setting  only  when  you
                                             set  Rate  control mode (RateCon-

                                             output.  MediaConvert  determines
                                             the  right  number of bits to use
                                             for each part  of  the  video  to
                                             maintain  the  video quality that
                                             you specify. When  you  keep  the
                                             default value, AUTO, MediaConvert
                                             picks a quality  level  for  you,
                                             based  on characteristics of your
                                             input video.  If  you  prefer  to
                                             specify  a quality level, specify
                                             a number from 1 through  10.  Use
                                             higher  numbers for greater qual-
                                             ity. Level 10 results  in  nearly
                                             lossless compression. The quality
                                             level for most  broadcast-quality
                                             transcodes  is  between  6 and 9.

                                             example, if you  want  your  QVBR
                                             quality  level  to  be  7.33, set

                                             that  is  between  whole numbers.
                                             For example,  if  you  want  your
                                             QVBR  quality  level  to be 7.33,
                                             set qvbrQualityLevel to 7 and set
                                             qvbrQualityLevelFineTune  to .33.
                                             MediaConvert  rounds  your   QVBR

                                             qvbrQualityLevelFineTune  to .25,
                                             your actual QVBR quality level is
                                             7.33.

                                          When you enable  this  feature,  the
                                          encoder  uses  fewer  bits  on areas
                                          that  can  sustain  more  distortion
                                          with  no  noticeable visual degrada-
                                          tion and uses  more  bits  on  areas
                                          where  any  small distortion will be
                                          noticeable.  For  example,   complex
                                          textured  blocks  are  encoded  with
                                          fewer  bits  and   smooth   textured
                                          blocks  are  encoded with more bits.
                                          Enabling this  feature  will  almost
                                          always  improve  your video quality.
                                          Note,  though,  that  this   feature
                                          doesn't  take into account where the

                                      FramerateControl -> (string)
                                          If  you  are  using the console, use
                                          the Framerate setting to specify the
                                          frame  rate  for this output. If you
                                          want to keep the same frame rate  as
                                          the   input   video,  choose  Follow
                                          source. If you want to do frame rate
                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the dropdown list or choose  Custom.
                                          The framerates shown in the dropdown
                                          list are decimal  approximations  of
                                          fractions.  If  you  choose  Custom,
                                          specify your frame rate as  a  frac-
                                          tion.   If  you  are  creating  your
                                          transcoding job specification  as  a
                                          JSON  file  without the console, use
                                          FramerateControl  to  specify  which
                                          value the service uses for the frame
                                          rate for this  output.  Choose  INI-
                                          TIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE  if you want the
                                          service to use the frame  rate  from
                                          the  input.  Choose SPECIFIED if you
                                          want the service to  use  the  frame
                                          rate  you  specify  in  the settings
                                          FramerateNumerator and  FramerateDe-

                                      FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                          Choose  the  method  that  you  want
                                          MediaConvert  to use when increasing
                                          or decreasing  the  frame  rate.  We
                                          recommend   using   drop   duplicate
                                          (DUPLICATE_DROP)   for   numerically
                                          simple  conversions,  such as 60 fps
                                          to 30 fps. For  numerically  complex
                                          conversions, you can use interpolate
                                          (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This
                                          results  in  a  smooth  picture, but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts.  For  complex  frame rate
                                          conversions,  especially   if   your
                                          source  video  has already been con-
                                          verted from  its  original  cadence,
                                          use  FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion method  frame  by  frame.  Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to specify the denominator  of  this
                                          fraction.  In this example, use 1001
                                          for the value of  FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor.  When  you  use the console for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976  fps.  Use FramerateNumerator
                                          to specify  the  numerator  of  this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When   you   use   the  console  for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                          Choose  the  scan  line type for the
                                          output. Keep the default value, Pro-
                                          gressive  (PROGRESSIVE)  to create a
                                          progressive  output,  regardless  of
                                          the scan type of your input. Use Top
                                          field first  (TOP_FIELD)  or  Bottom
                                          field first (BOTTOM_FIELD) to create
                                          an output that's interlaced with the
                                          same  field polarity throughout. Use
                                          Follow,    default     top     (FOL-
                                          LOW_TOP_FIELD)  or  Follow,  default
                                          bottom (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to pro-
                                          duce  outputs  with  the  same field
                                          polarity as  the  source.  For  jobs
                                          that  have multiple inputs, the out-
                                          put field polarity might change over
                                          the  course  of  the  output. Follow
                                          behavior depends on the  input  scan
                                          type.  If  the source is interlaced,
                                          the output will be  interlaced  with
                                          the  same polarity as the source. If
                                          the source is progressive, the  out-
                                          put  will  be  interlaced  with  top
                                          field bottom field first,  depending
                                          on  which  of the Follow options you
                                          choose.

                                          Use this setting for interlaced out-
                                          puts, when your output frame rate is
                                          half of your input  frame  rate.  In
                                          this   situation,  choose  Optimized

                                      FlickerAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)

                                          other  than  AUTO, the default value
                                          for  H264FlickerAdaptiveQuantization
                                          is  Disabled (DISABLED). Change this
                                          value to Enabled (ENABLED) to reduce
                                          I-frame  pop. I-frame pop appears as
                                          a visual flicker that can arise when
                                          the  encoder  saves  bits by copying
                                          some  macroblocks  many  times  from
                                          frame  to  frame, and then refreshes
                                          them at the I-frame. When you enable
                                          this  setting,  the  encoder updates
                                          these  macroblocks   slightly   more
                                          often  to smooth out the flicker. To

                                          the Framerate setting to specify the
                                          frame rate for this output.  If  you
                                          want  to keep the same frame rate as
                                          the  input  video,   choose   Follow
                                          source. If you want to do frame rate
                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the  dropdown list or choose Custom.
                                          The framerates shown in the dropdown
                                          list  are  decimal approximations of
                                          fractions.  If  you  choose  Custom,
                                          specify  your  frame rate as a frac-
                                          tion.  If  you  are  creating   your
                                          transcoding  job  specification as a
                                          JSON file without the  console,  use
                                          FramerateControl  to  specify  which
                                          value the service uses for the frame
                                          rate  for  this  output. Choose INI-
                                          TIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE if you want  the
                                          service  to  use the frame rate from
                                          the input. Choose SPECIFIED  if  you
                                          want  the  service  to use the frame
                                          rate you  specify  in  the  settings
                                          FramerateNumerator  and FramerateDe-
                                          nominator.

                                      FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                          Choose  the  method  that  you  want
                                          MediaConvert to use when  increasing
                                          or  decreasing  the  frame  rate. We
                                          recommend   using   drop   duplicate
                                          (DUPLICATE_DROP)   for   numerically
                                          simple conversions, such as  60  fps
                                          to  30  fps. For numerically complex
                                          conversions, you can use interpolate
                                          (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This
                                          results in  a  smooth  picture,  but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts. For  complex  frame  rate
                                          conversions,   especially   if  your
                                          source video has already  been  con-
                                          verted  from  its  original cadence,
                                          use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to  do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion  method  frame  by  frame. Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding  time  and incurs a sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to  specify  the denominator of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use  1001
                                          for  the value of FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor. When you use  the  console  for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps.  Use  FramerateNumerator
                                          to  specify  the  numerator  of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When  you  use   the   console   for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      GopBReference -> (string)
                                          If enable, use  reference  B  frames
                                          for   GOP  structures  that  have  B
                                          frames > 1.

                                      GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                                          Specify the  relative  frequency  of
                                          open  to closed GOPs in this output.
                                          For example, if you  want  to  allow
                                          four  open  GOPs  and then require a
                                          closed GOP, set this value to 5.  We
                                          recommend    that   you   have   the
                                          transcoder automatically choose this
                                          value  for you based on characteris-
                                          tics of your input video. To  enable
                                          this  automatic  behavior,  keep the
                                          default value by leaving  this  set-
                                          ting out of your JSON job specifica-
                                          tion. In the  console,  do  this  by
                                          keeping  the default empty value. If
                                          you do explicitly specify  a  value,
                                          for  segmented  outputs,  don't  set
                                          this value to 0.

                                      GopSize -> (double)
                                          Use this setting only when  you  set
                                          GOP  mode  control (GopSizeUnits) to
                                          Specified, frames (FRAMES) or Speci-
                                          fied, seconds (SECONDS). Specify the
                                          GOP length using a whole  number  of
                                          frames  or  a  decimal value of sec-
                                          onds.  MediaConvert  will  interpret
                                          this  value  as  frames  or  seconds
                                          depending on the  value  you  choose
                                          for GOP mode control (GopSizeUnits).
                                          If you want to allow MediaConvert to
                                          automatically  determine  GOP  size,
                                          leave GOP size  blank  and  set  GOP
                                          mode control to Auto (AUTO). If your
                                          output group specifies HLS, DASH, or
                                          CMAF,  leave  GOP size blank and set
                                          GOP mode control  to  Auto  in  each
                                          output in your output group.

                                      GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                                          Specify  how  the  transcoder deter-
                                          mines GOP size for this  output.  We
                                          recommend    that   you   have   the
                                          transcoder automatically choose this
                                          value  for you based on characteris-
                                          tics of your input video. To  enable
                                          this automatic behavior, choose Auto
                                          (AUTO) and and leave GOP size  (Gop-
                                          Size)  blank.  By  default,  if  you
                                          don't specify GOP mode control (Gop-
                                          SizeUnits),  MediaConvert  will  use
                                          automatic behavior. If  your  output
                                          group  specifies HLS, DASH, or CMAF,
                                          set GOP mode  control  to  Auto  and
                                          leave  GOP size blank in each output
                                          in your output group. To  explicitly
                                          specify the GOP length, choose Spec-
                                          ified, frames (FRAMES) or Specified,
                                          seconds  (SECONDS)  and then provide
                                          the GOP length in the  related  set-
                                          ting GOP size (GopSize).

                                      HrdBufferInitialFillPercentage -> (inte-
                                      ger)
                                          Percentage of the buffer that should
                                          initially   be  filled  (HRD  buffer

                                      HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                                          Size of buffer (HRD buffer model) in
                                          bits.   For   example,   enter  five

                                          field first (BOTTOM_FIELD) to create
                                          an output that's interlaced with the
                                          same field polarity throughout.  Use
                                          Follow,     default     top    (FOL-
                                          LOW_TOP_FIELD)  or  Follow,  default

                                          that have multiple inputs, the  out-
                                          put field polarity might change over
                                          the course  of  the  output.  Follow
                                          behavior  depends  on the input scan
                                          type. If the source  is  interlaced,
                                          the  output  will be interlaced with
                                          the same polarity as the source.  If
                                          the  source is progressive, the out-
                                          put  will  be  interlaced  with  top

                                          on which of the Follow  options  you
                                          choose.

                                      MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                          Maximum  bitrate in bits/second. For
                                          example,  enter  five  megabits  per
                                          second  as  5000000.  Required  when
                                          Rate control mode is QVBR.

                                      MinIInterval -> (integer)
                                          Use this setting only when you  also
                                          enable    Scene   change   detection
                                          (SceneChangeDetect).  This   setting
                                          determines  how  the encoder manages
                                          the spacing between I-frames that it
                                          inserts   as  part  of  the  I-frame
                                          cadence and  the  I-frames  that  it
                                          inserts  for Scene change detection.
                                          We  recommend  that  you  have   the
                                          transcoder automatically choose this
                                          value for you based on  characteris-
                                          tics  of your input video. To enable
                                          this automatic  behavior,  keep  the
                                          default  value  by leaving this set-
                                          ting out of your JSON job specifica-
                                          tion.  In  the  console,  do this by
                                          keeping  the  default  empty  value.
                                          When  you explicitly specify a value
                                          for this setting, the encoder deter-
                                          mines     whether    to    skip    a
                                          cadence-driven I-frame by the  value
                                          you set. For example, if you set Min
                                          I interval (minIInterval) to 5 and a
                                          cadence-driven  I-frame  would  fall
                                          within 5 frames  of  a  scene-change
                                          I-frame,  then the encoder skips the
                                          cadence-driven I-frame. In this way,
                                          one  GOP  is shrunk slightly and one
                                          GOP is stretched slightly. When  the
                                          cadence-driven  I-frames are farther
                                          from the scene-change  I-frame  than
                                          the  value you set, then the encoder
                                          leaves all I-frames in place and the
                                          GOPs  surrounding  the  scene change
                                          are smaller than the  usual  cadence
                                          GOPs.

                                      (integer)
                                          This setting to determines the  num-
                                          ber  of  B-frames  that MediaConvert
                                          puts  between  reference  frames  in
                                          this  output.  We recommend that you
                                          use automatic behavior to allow  the
                                          transcoder  to choose the best value
                                          based  on  characteristics  of  your
                                          input  video. In the console, choose
                                          AUTO to select this automatic behav-
                                          ior.  When  you  manually  edit your
                                          JSON job specification,  leave  this
                                          setting   out  to  choose  automatic
                                          behavior. When you want  to  specify
                                          this  number  explicitly,  choose  a
                                          whole number from 0 through 7.

                                      NumberReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                                          Number of reference frames  to  use.
                                          The   encoder   may  use  more  than
                                          requested if using  B-frames  and/or
                                          interlaced encoding.

                                      ParControl -> (string)
                                          Optional.  Specify  how  the service
                                          determines the  pixel  aspect  ratio
                                          (PAR)  for  this output. The default
                                          behavior,  Follow  source  (INITIAL-
                                          IZE_FROM_SOURCE),  uses the PAR from
                                          your input video for your output. To
                                          specify  a different PAR in the con-
                                          sole, choose any  value  other  than
                                          Follow  source. To specify a differ-
                                          ent PAR  by  editing  the  JSON  job
                                          specification,   choose   SPECIFIED.
                                          When you choose SPECIFIED  for  this
                                          setting,  you must also specify val-
                                          ues for the parNumerator and  parDe-
                                          nominator settings.

                                      ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                          Required  when  you set Pixel aspect
                                          ratio (parControl) to SPECIFIED.  On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you  specify  an output pixel aspect
                                          ratio (PAR) that is  different  from
                                          your  input  video PAR, provide your
                                          output PAR as a ratio. For  example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the  ratio  40:33.  In  this
                                          example,  the value for parDenomina-
                                          tor is 33.

                                      ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                          Required when you set  Pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (parControl) to SPECIFIED. On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you specify an output  pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (PAR)  that is different from
                                          your input video PAR,  provide  your
                                          output  PAR as a ratio. For example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify  the  ratio  40:33.  In this
                                          example, the value for  parNumerator
                                          is 40.

                                      QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                          Optional.  Use  Quality tuning level
                                          (qualityTuningLevel) to  choose  how
                                          you want to trade off encoding speed
                                          for  output   video   quality.   The
                                          default  behavior  is  faster, lower
                                          quality, single-pass encoding.

                                      QvbrSettings -> (structure)

                                          you  set  QVBR for Rate control mode
                                          (RateControlMode).

                                          QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                                             Use  this  setting  only when you
                                             set Rate control  mode  (RateCon-
                                             trolMode)  to  QVBR.  Specify the
                                             target  quality  level  for  this
                                             output.  MediaConvert  determines
                                             the right number of bits  to  use
                                             for  each  part  of  the video to
                                             maintain the video  quality  that
                                             you  specify.  When  you keep the
                                             default value, AUTO, MediaConvert
                                             picks  a  quality  level for you,
                                             based on characteristics of  your
                                             input  video.  If  you  prefer to
                                             specify a quality level,  specify
                                             a  number  from 1 through 10. Use
                                             higher numbers for greater  qual-
                                             ity.  Level  10 results in nearly
                                             lossless compression. The quality
                                             level  for most broadcast-quality
                                             transcodes is between  6  and  9.
                                             Optionally,  to  specify  a value
                                             between whole numbers, also  pro-

                                             qvbrQualityLevelFineTune.     For
                                             example,  if  you  want your QVBR
                                             quality level  to  be  7.33,  set
                                             qvbrQualityLevel  to  7  and  set
                                             qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to  .33.

                                          QvbrQualityLevelFineTune -> (double)
                                             Optional. Specify a value here to
                                             set  the  QVBR quality to a level
                                             that is  between  whole  numbers.
                                             For  example,  if  you  want your
                                             QVBR quality level  to  be  7.33,
                                             set qvbrQualityLevel to 7 and set
                                             qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to  .33.
                                             MediaConvert   rounds  your  QVBR
                                             quality  level  to  the   nearest
                                             third  of  a  whole  number.  For
                                             example,  if  you  set  qvbrQual-
                                             ityLevel   to   7   and  you  set
                                             qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to  .25,
                                             your actual QVBR quality level is
                                             7.33.

                                      RateControlMode -> (string)
                                          Use this setting to specify  whether
                                          this  output  has a variable bitrate
                                          (VBR),  constant  bitrate  (CBR)  or

                                      ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                                          Use this setting for interlaced out-
                                          puts, when your output frame rate is
                                          half  of  your  input frame rate. In
                                          this  situation,  choose   Optimized
                                          interlacing (INTERLACED_OPTIMIZE) to
                                          create a better  quality  interlaced
                                          output.  In this case, each progres-

                                          all other output frame  rates.  With
                                          basic interlacing, MediaConvert per-
                                          forms  any  frame  rate   conversion
                                          first   and   then   interlaces  the
                                          frames. When  you  choose  Optimized
                                          interlacing  and you set your output
                                          frame rate to  a  value  that  isn't
                                          suitable  for optimized interlacing,

                                      SlowPal -> (string)
                                          Ignore   this  setting  unless  your
                                          input frame rate  is  23.976  or  24
                                          frames per second (fps). Enable slow
                                          PAL to create a 25 fps output.  When
                                          you  enable  slow  PAL, MediaConvert
                                          relabels the video frames to 25  fps
                                          and  resamples your audio to keep it

                                          that   enabling  this  setting  will
                                          slightly reduce the duration of your
                                          video.  Required  settings: You must
                                          also set Framerate to  25.  In  your
                                          JSON job specification, set (framer-

                                      Softness -> (integer)
                                          Ignore this setting unless you  need
                                          to  comply with a specification that
                                          requires a specific  value.  If  you
                                          don't  have a specification require-
                                          ment, we recommend that  you  adjust
                                          the softness of your output by using
                                          a lower value for the setting Sharp-
                                          ness  (sharpness)  or  by enabling a
                                          noise reducer filter  (noiseReducer-
                                          Filter).   The  Softness  (softness)
                                          setting specifies  the  quantization
                                          matrices that the encoder uses. Keep
                                          the default value, 0, for flat quan-
                                          tization.  Choose  the value 1 or 16
                                          to use  the  default  JVT  softening
                                          quantization   matricies   from  the
                                          H.264 specification. Choose a  value
                                          from  17 to 128 to use planar inter-
                                          polation. Increasing values from  17
                                          to  128  result in increasing reduc-
                                          tion  of  high-frequency  data.  The
                                          value  128  results  in  the softest
                                          video.

                                          tion to a value other than AUTO, the

                                          (ENABLED). Keep this  default  value
                                          to  adjust  quantization within each
                                          frame based on spatial variation  of
                                          content  complexity. When you enable
                                          this feature, the encoder uses fewer
                                          bits  on areas that can sustain more
                                          distortion with no noticeable visual
                                          degradation  and  uses  more bits on
                                          areas  where  any  small  distortion
                                          will  be  noticeable.  For  example,
                                          complex textured blocks are  encoded
                                          with  fewer bits and smooth textured
                                          blocks are encoded with  more  bits.
                                          Enabling  this  feature  will almost
                                          always improve your  video  quality.
                                          Note,   though,  that  this  feature
                                          doesn't take into account where  the

                                          When  you  enable  this feature, the

                                          uses more bits  on  complex  objects
                                          with  sharp  edges  that move a lot.
                                          For example, this  feature  improves
                                          the  readability  of text tickers on

                                          to  use  fewer B-frames (which infer
                                          information based on  other  frames)
                                          for   high-motion  portions  of  the

                                      FlickerAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                                          Enable  this  setting  to  have  the
                                          encoder  reduce I-frame pop. I-frame
                                          pop appears as a visual flicker that
                                          can  arise  when  the  encoder saves
                                          bits  by  copying  some  macroblocks
                                          many  times from frame to frame, and
                                          then refreshes them at the  I-frame.
                                          When  you  enable  this setting, the
                                          encoder  updates  these  macroblocks
                                          slightly  more  often  to smooth out
                                          the flicker. This  setting  is  dis-

                                      FramerateControl -> (string)
                                          If  you  are  using the console, use
                                          the Framerate setting to specify the
                                          frame  rate  for this output. If you
                                          want to keep the same frame rate  as
                                          the   input   video,  choose  Follow
                                          source. If you want to do frame rate
                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the dropdown list or choose  Custom.
                                          The framerates shown in the dropdown
                                          list are decimal  approximations  of
                                          fractions.  If  you  choose  Custom,
                                          specify your frame rate as  a  frac-
                                          tion.   If  you  are  creating  your
                                          transcoding job specification  as  a
                                          JSON  file  without the console, use
                                          FramerateControl  to  specify  which
                                          value the service uses for the frame
                                          rate for this  output.  Choose  INI-
                                          TIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE  if you want the
                                          service to use the frame  rate  from
                                          the  input.  Choose SPECIFIED if you
                                          want the service to  use  the  frame
                                          rate  you  specify  in  the settings
                                          FramerateNumerator and  FramerateDe-

                                      FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                          Choose  the  method  that  you  want
                                          MediaConvert  to use when increasing
                                          or decreasing  the  frame  rate.  We
                                          recommend   using   drop   duplicate
                                          (DUPLICATE_DROP)   for   numerically
                                          simple  conversions,  such as 60 fps
                                          to 30 fps. For  numerically  complex
                                          conversions, you can use interpolate
                                          (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This
                                          results  in  a  smooth  picture, but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts.  For  complex  frame rate
                                          conversions,  especially   if   your
                                          source  video  has already been con-
                                          verted from  its  original  cadence,
                                          use  FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion method  frame  by  frame.  Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to specify the denominator  of  this
                                          fraction.  In this example, use 1001
                                          for the value of  FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor.  When  you  use the console for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976  fps.  Use FramerateNumerator
                                          to specify  the  numerator  of  this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When   you   use   the  console  for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      GopBReference -> (string)
                                          If  enable,  use  reference B frames
                                          for  GOP  structures  that  have   B
                                          frames > 1.

                                      GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                                          Specify  the  relative  frequency of
                                          open to closed GOPs in this  output.
                                          For  example,  if  you want to allow
                                          four open GOPs and  then  require  a
                                          closed  GOP, set this value to 5. We
                                          recommend   that   you   have    the
                                          transcoder automatically choose this
                                          value for you based on  characteris-
                                          tics  of your input video. To enable
                                          this automatic  behavior,  keep  the
                                          default  value  by leaving this set-
                                          ting out of your JSON job specifica-
                                          tion.  In  the  console,  do this by
                                          keeping the default empty value.  If
                                          you  do  explicitly specify a value,
                                          for  segmented  outputs,  don't  set
                                          this value to 0.

                                      GopSize -> (double)
                                          Use  this  setting only when you set
                                          GOP mode control  (GopSizeUnits)  to
                                          Specified, frames (FRAMES) or Speci-
                                          fied, seconds (SECONDS). Specify the
                                          GOP  length  using a whole number of
                                          frames or a decimal  value  of  sec-
                                          onds.  MediaConvert  will  interpret
                                          this  value  as  frames  or  seconds
                                          depending  on  the  value you choose
                                          for GOP mode control (GopSizeUnits).
                                          If you want to allow MediaConvert to
                                          automatically  determine  GOP  size,
                                          leave  GOP  size  blank  and set GOP
                                          mode control to Auto (AUTO). If your
                                          output group specifies HLS, DASH, or
                                          CMAF, leave GOP size blank  and  set
                                          GOP  mode  control  to  Auto in each
                                          output in your output group.

                                      GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                                          Specify how  the  transcoder  deter-
                                          mines  GOP  size for this output. We
                                          recommend   that   you   have    the
                                          transcoder automatically choose this
                                          value for you based on  characteris-
                                          tics  of your input video. To enable
                                          this automatic behavior, choose Auto
                                          (AUTO)  and and leave GOP size (Gop-
                                          Size)  blank.  By  default,  if  you
                                          don't specify GOP mode control (Gop-
                                          SizeUnits),  MediaConvert  will  use
                                          automatic  behavior.  If your output
                                          group specifies HLS, DASH, or  CMAF,
                                          set  GOP  mode  control  to Auto and
                                          leave GOP size blank in each  output
                                          in  your output group. To explicitly
                                          specify the GOP length, choose Spec-
                                          ified, frames (FRAMES) or Specified,
                                          seconds (SECONDS) and  then  provide
                                          the  GOP  length in the related set-

                                      HrdBufferInitialFillPercentage -> (inte-
                                      ger)
                                          Percentage of the buffer that should
                                          initially  be  filled  (HRD   buffer
                                          model).

                                      HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                                          Size of buffer (HRD buffer model) in
                                          bits.  For   example,   enter   five
                                          megabits as 5000000.

                                      InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                          Choose  the  scan  line type for the
                                          output. Keep the default value, Pro-
                                          gressive  (PROGRESSIVE)  to create a
                                          progressive  output,  regardless  of
                                          the scan type of your input. Use Top
                                          field first  (TOP_FIELD)  or  Bottom
                                          field first (BOTTOM_FIELD) to create
                                          an output that's interlaced with the
                                          same  field polarity throughout. Use
                                          Follow,    default     top     (FOL-
                                          LOW_TOP_FIELD)  or  Follow,  default
                                          bottom (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to pro-
                                          duce  outputs  with  the  same field
                                          polarity as  the  source.  For  jobs
                                          that  have multiple inputs, the out-
                                          put field polarity might change over
                                          the  course  of  the  output. Follow
                                          behavior depends on the  input  scan
                                          type.  If  the source is interlaced,
                                          the output will be  interlaced  with
                                          the  same polarity as the source. If
                                          the source is progressive, the  out-
                                          put  will  be  interlaced  with  top
                                          field bottom field first,  depending
                                          on  which  of the Follow options you
                                          choose.

                                      MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                          Maximum bitrate in bits/second.  For
                                          example,  enter  five  megabits  per
                                          second  as  5000000.  Required  when
                                          Rate control mode is QVBR.

                                      MinIInterval -> (integer)
                                          Use  this setting only when you also
                                          enable   Scene   change    detection
                                          (SceneChangeDetect).   This  setting
                                          determines how the  encoder  manages
                                          the spacing between I-frames that it
                                          inserts  as  part  of  the   I-frame
                                          cadence  and  the  I-frames  that it
                                          inserts for Scene change  detection.
                                          We   recommend  that  you  have  the
                                          transcoder automatically choose this
                                          value  for you based on characteris-
                                          tics of your input video. To  enable
                                          this  automatic  behavior,  keep the
                                          default value by leaving  this  set-
                                          ting out of your JSON job specifica-
                                          tion. In the  console,  do  this  by
                                          keeping  the  default  empty  value.
                                          When you explicitly specify a  value
                                          for this setting, the encoder deter-
                                          mines    whether    to    skip     a
                                          cadence-driven  I-frame by the value
                                          you set. For example, if you set Min
                                          I interval (minIInterval) to 5 and a
                                          cadence-driven  I-frame  would  fall
                                          within  5  frames  of a scene-change
                                          I-frame, then the encoder skips  the
                                          cadence-driven I-frame. In this way,
                                          one GOP is shrunk slightly  and  one
                                          GOP  is stretched slightly. When the
                                          cadence-driven I-frames are  farther
                                          from  the  scene-change I-frame than
                                          the value you set, then the  encoder
                                          leaves all I-frames in place and the
                                          GOPs surrounding  the  scene  change
                                          are  smaller  than the usual cadence
                                          GOPs.

                                      NumberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames   ->
                                      (integer)
                                          Specify  the number of B-frames that
                                          MediaConvert puts between  reference
                                          frames  in this output. Valid values
                                          are whole numbers from 0 through  7.
                                          When  you  don't  specify  a  value,
                                          MediaConvert defaults to 2.

                                      NumberReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                                          Number of reference frames  to  use.
                                          The   encoder   may  use  more  than
                                          requested if using  B-frames  and/or
                                          interlaced encoding.

                                      ParControl -> (string)
                                          Optional.  Specify  how  the service
                                          determines the  pixel  aspect  ratio
                                          (PAR)  for  this output. The default
                                          behavior,  Follow  source  (INITIAL-
                                          IZE_FROM_SOURCE),  uses the PAR from
                                          your input video for your output. To
                                          specify  a different PAR in the con-
                                          sole, choose any  value  other  than
                                          Follow  source. To specify a differ-
                                          ent PAR  by  editing  the  JSON  job
                                          specification,   choose   SPECIFIED.
                                          When you choose SPECIFIED  for  this
                                          setting,  you must also specify val-
                                          ues for the parNumerator and  parDe-
                                          nominator settings.

                                      ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                          Required  when  you set Pixel aspect
                                          ratio (parControl) to SPECIFIED.  On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you  specify  an output pixel aspect
                                          ratio (PAR) that is  different  from
                                          your  input  video PAR, provide your
                                          output PAR as a ratio. For  example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the  ratio  40:33.  In  this
                                          example,  the value for parDenomina-
                                          tor is 33.

                                      ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                          Required when you set  Pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (parControl) to SPECIFIED. On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you specify an output  pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (PAR)  that is different from
                                          your input video PAR,  provide  your
                                          output  PAR as a ratio. For example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify  the  ratio  40:33.  In this
                                          example, the value for  parNumerator
                                          is 40.

                                          QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                                             Use  this  setting  only when you
                                             set Rate control  mode  (RateCon-

                                             output.  MediaConvert  determines
                                             the right number of bits  to  use
                                             for  each  part  of  the video to
                                             maintain the video  quality  that
                                             you  specify.  When  you keep the
                                             default value, AUTO, MediaConvert
                                             picks  a  quality  level for you,
                                             based on characteristics of  your
                                             input  video.  If  you  prefer to
                                             specify a quality level,  specify
                                             a  number  from 1 through 10. Use
                                             higher numbers for greater  qual-
                                             ity.  Level  10 results in nearly
                                             lossless compression. The quality
                                             level  for most broadcast-quality
                                             transcodes is between  6  and  9.

                                             example,  if  you  want your QVBR
                                             quality level  to  be  7.33,  set

                                             that is  between  whole  numbers.
                                             For  example,  if  you  want your
                                             QVBR quality level  to  be  7.33,
                                             set qvbrQualityLevel to 7 and set
                                             qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to  .33.
                                             MediaConvert   rounds  your  QVBR

                                          When  you  enable  this feature, the
                                          encoder uses  fewer  bits  on  areas
                                          that  can  sustain  more  distortion
                                          with no noticeable  visual  degrada-
                                          tion  and  uses  more  bits on areas
                                          where any small distortion  will  be
                                          noticeable.   For  example,  complex
                                          textured  blocks  are  encoded  with
                                          fewer   bits   and  smooth  textured
                                          blocks are encoded with  more  bits.
                                          Enabling  this  feature  will almost
                                          always improve your  video  quality.
                                          Note,   though,  that  this  feature
                                          doesn't take into account where  the
                                          viewer's  attention is likely to be.
                                          If viewers are likely to be focusing

                                          uses more bits  on  complex  objects
                                          with  sharp  edges  that move a lot.
                                          For example, this  feature  improves

                                          to  use  fewer B-frames (which infer
                                          information based on  other  frames)
                                          for   high-motion  portions  of  the

                                          If you are using  the  console,  use
                                          the Framerate setting to specify the
                                          frame rate for this output.  If  you
                                          want  to keep the same frame rate as
                                          the  input  video,   choose   Follow
                                          source. If you want to do frame rate
                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the  dropdown list or choose Custom.
                                          The framerates shown in the dropdown
                                          list  are  decimal approximations of
                                          fractions.  If  you  choose  Custom,
                                          specify  your  frame rate as a frac-

                                          Choose  the  method  that  you  want
                                          MediaConvert to use when  increasing
                                          or  decreasing  the  frame  rate. We
                                          recommend   using   drop   duplicate
                                          (DUPLICATE_DROP)   for   numerically
                                          simple conversions, such as  60  fps
                                          to  30  fps. For numerically complex
                                          conversions, you can use interpolate
                                          (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This
                                          results in  a  smooth  picture,  but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts. For  complex  frame  rate
                                          conversions,   especially   if  your
                                          source video has already  been  con-
                                          verted  from  its  original cadence,
                                          use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to  do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion  method  frame  by  frame. Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding  time  and incurs a sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to  specify  the denominator of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use  1001
                                          for  the value of FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor. When you use  the  console  for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps.  Use  FramerateNumerator
                                          to  specify  the  numerator  of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When  you  use   the   console   for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                                          Specify the  relative  frequency  of
                                          open  to closed GOPs in this output.
                                          For example, if you  want  to  allow
                                          four  open  GOPs  and then require a
                                          closed GOP, set  this  value  to  5.
                                          When  you create a streaming output,
                                          we  recommend  that  you  keep   the
                                          default  value,  1,  so that players
                                          starting mid-stream receive  an  IDR
                                          frame  as quickly as possible. Don't
                                          set this  value  to  0;  that  would
                                          break output segmenting.

                                      GopSize -> (double)
                                          Specify    the    interval   between
                                          keyframes, in seconds or frames, for

                                          here,  by  default  the encoder mea-

                                          the source is progressive, the  out-
                                          put  will  be  interlaced  with  top
                                          field bottom field first,  depending
                                          on  which  of the Follow options you
                                          choose.

                                      IntraDcPrecision -> (string)
                                          Use Intra DC precision (Mpeg2IntraD-
                                          cPrecision) to set quantization pre-
                                          cision for  intra-block  DC  coeffi-
                                          cients.  If  you  choose  the  value
                                          auto, the service will automatically
                                          select  the  precision  based on the
                                          per-frame compression ratio.

                                      MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                          Maximum bitrate in bits/second.  For
                                          example,  enter  five  megabits  per
                                          second as 5000000.

                                      MinIInterval -> (integer)
                                          Use this setting only when you  also
                                          enable    Scene   change   detection
                                          (SceneChangeDetect).  This   setting
                                          determines  how  the encoder manages
                                          the spacing between I-frames that it
                                          inserts   as  part  of  the  I-frame
                                          cadence and  the  I-frames  that  it
                                          inserts  for Scene change detection.
                                          When you specify a  value  for  this
                                          setting,   the   encoder  determines
                                          whether  to  skip  a  cadence-driven
                                          I-frame  by  the  value you set. For
                                          example, if you set Min  I  interval
                                          (minIInterval)    to    5    and   a
                                          cadence-driven  I-frame  would  fall
                                          within  5  frames  of a scene-change
                                          I-frame, then the encoder skips  the
                                          cadence-driven I-frame. In this way,
                                          one GOP is shrunk slightly  and  one
                                          GOP  is stretched slightly. When the
                                          cadence-driven I-frames are  farther
                                          from  the  scene-change I-frame than
                                          the value you set, then the  encoder
                                          leaves all I-frames in place and the
                                          GOPs surrounding  the  scene  change
                                          are  smaller  than the usual cadence
                                          GOPs.

                                      NumberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames   ->
                                      (integer)
                                          Specify  the number of B-frames that
                                          MediaConvert puts between  reference
                                          frames  in this output. Valid values
                                          are whole numbers from 0 through  7.
                                          When  you  don't  specify  a  value,
                                          MediaConvert defaults to 2.

                                      ParControl -> (string)
                                          Optional. Specify  how  the  service
                                          determines  the  pixel  aspect ratio
                                          (PAR) for this output.  The  default
                                          behavior,  Follow  source  (INITIAL-
                                          IZE_FROM_SOURCE), uses the PAR  from
                                          your input video for your output. To
                                          specify a different PAR in the  con-
                                          sole,  choose  any  value other than
                                          Follow source. To specify a  differ-
                                          ent  PAR  by  editing  the  JSON job
                                          specification,   choose   SPECIFIED.
                                          When  you  choose SPECIFIED for this
                                          setting, you must also specify  val-
                                          ues  for the parNumerator and parDe-
                                          nominator settings.

                                      ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                          Required when you set  Pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (parControl) to SPECIFIED. On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you specify an output  pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (PAR)  that is different from
                                          your input video PAR,  provide  your
                                          output  PAR as a ratio. For example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify  the  ratio  40:33.  In this
                                          example, the value for  parDenomina-
                                          tor is 33.

                                      ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                          Required  when  you set Pixel aspect
                                          ratio (parControl) to SPECIFIED.  On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you  specify  an output pixel aspect
                                          ratio (PAR) that is  different  from
                                          your  input  video PAR, provide your
                                          output PAR as a ratio. For  example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the  ratio  40:33.  In  this
                                          example,  the value for parNumerator
                                          is 40.

                                      QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                          Optional. Use Quality  tuning  level
                                          (qualityTuningLevel)  to  choose how
                                          you want to trade off encoding speed
                                          for   output   video   quality.  The
                                          default behavior  is  faster,  lower
                                          quality, single-pass encoding.

                                      RateControlMode -> (string)
                                          Use Rate control mode (Mpeg2RateCon-
                                          trolMode)  to  specify  whether  the
                                          bitrate  is  variable  (vbr) or con-
                                          stant (cbr).

                                      ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                                          Use this setting for interlaced out-
                                          puts, when your output frame rate is
                                          half of your input  frame  rate.  In
                                          this   situation,  choose  Optimized
                                          interlacing (INTERLACED_OPTIMIZE) to
                                          create  a  better quality interlaced
                                          output. In this case, each  progres-
                                          sive  frame  from  the  input corre-
                                          sponds to an interlaced field in the

                                          Basic interlacing (INTERLACED),  for
                                          all  other  output frame rates. With
                                          basic interlacing, MediaConvert per-
                                          forms   any  frame  rate  conversion
                                          first  and   then   interlaces   the
                                          frames.  When  you  choose Optimized
                                          interlacing and you set your  output

                                          suitable for optimized  interlacing,
                                          MediaConvert   automatically   falls

                                      SceneChangeDetect -> (string)
                                          Enable   this   setting   to  insert
                                          I-frames at scene changes  that  the
                                          service  automatically detects. This
                                          improves  video   quality   and   is
                                          enabled by default.

                                      SlowPal -> (string)
                                          Ignore   this  setting  unless  your
                                          input frame rate  is  23.976  or  24
                                          frames per second (fps). Enable slow
                                          PAL to create a 25 fps output.  When
                                          you  enable  slow  PAL, MediaConvert
                                          relabels the video frames to 25  fps
                                          and  resamples your audio to keep it
                                          synchronized with  the  video.  Note

                                      Softness -> (integer)
                                          Ignore this setting unless you  need
                                          to  comply with a specification that
                                          requires a specific  value.  If  you

                                          ment, we recommend that  you  adjust
                                          the softness of your output by using
                                          a lower value for the setting Sharp-
                                          ness  (sharpness)  or  by enabling a
                                          noise reducer filter  (noiseReducer-
                                          Filter).   The  Softness  (softness)
                                          setting specifies  the  quantization
                                          matrices that the encoder uses. Keep
                                          the default value, 0, to use the AWS
                                          Elemental default matrices. Choose a
                                          value from 17 to 128 to  use  planar
                                          interpolation.   Increasing   values
                                          from 17 to 128 result in  increasing
                                          reduction  of  high-frequency  data.
                                          The value 128 results in the softest
                                          video.

                                          When  you  enable  this feature, the
                                          encoder uses  fewer  bits  on  areas
                                          that  can  sustain  more  distortion
                                          with no noticeable  visual  degrada-
                                          tion  and  uses  more  bits on areas
                                          where any small distortion  will  be
                                          noticeable.   For  example,  complex
                                          textured  blocks  are  encoded  with
                                          fewer   bits   and  smooth  textured
                                          blocks are encoded with  more  bits.
                                          Enabling  this  feature  will almost
                                          always improve your  video  quality.
                                          Note,   though,  that  this  feature
                                          doesn't take into account where  the

                                          codec to use for this output.

                                      FramerateControl -> (string)
                                          If  you  are  using the console, use
                                          the Framerate setting to specify the
                                          frame  rate  for this output. If you
                                          want to keep the same frame rate  as
                                          the   input   video,  choose  Follow
                                          source. If you want to do frame rate
                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the dropdown list or choose  Custom.
                                          The framerates shown in the dropdown
                                          list are decimal  approximations  of
                                          fractions.  If  you  choose  Custom,
                                          specify your frame rate as  a  frac-
                                          tion.   If  you  are  creating  your
                                          transcoding job specification  as  a
                                          JSON  file  without the console, use
                                          FramerateControl  to  specify  which
                                          value the service uses for the frame
                                          rate for this  output.  Choose  INI-
                                          TIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE  if you want the
                                          service to use the frame  rate  from
                                          the  input.  Choose SPECIFIED if you
                                          want the service to  use  the  frame
                                          rate  you  specify  in  the settings
                                          FramerateNumerator and  FramerateDe-
                                          nominator.

                                      FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                          Choose  the  method  that  you  want
                                          MediaConvert  to use when increasing
                                          or decreasing  the  frame  rate.  We
                                          recommend   using   drop   duplicate
                                          (DUPLICATE_DROP)   for   numerically
                                          simple  conversions,  such as 60 fps
                                          to 30 fps. For  numerically  complex
                                          conversions, you can use interpolate
                                          (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This
                                          results  in  a  smooth  picture, but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts.  For  complex  frame rate
                                          conversions,  especially   if   your
                                          source  video  has already been con-
                                          verted from  its  original  cadence,
                                          use  FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion method  frame  by  frame.  Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to specify the denominator  of  this
                                          fraction.  In this example, use 1001
                                          for the value of  FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor.  When  you  use the console for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976  fps.  Use FramerateNumerator
                                          to specify  the  numerator  of  this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When   you   use   the  console  for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                          Choose  the  scan  line type for the
                                          output. Keep the default value, Pro-
                                          gressive  (PROGRESSIVE)  to create a
                                          progressive  output,  regardless  of
                                          the scan type of your input. Use Top
                                          field first  (TOP_FIELD)  or  Bottom
                                          field first (BOTTOM_FIELD) to create
                                          an output that's interlaced with the
                                          same  field polarity throughout. Use
                                          Follow,    default     top     (FOL-
                                          LOW_TOP_FIELD)  or  Follow,  default
                                          bottom (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to pro-
                                          duce  outputs  with  the  same field
                                          polarity as  the  source.  For  jobs
                                          that  have multiple inputs, the out-
                                          put field polarity might change over
                                          the  course  of  the  output. Follow
                                          behavior depends on the  input  scan
                                          type.  If  the source is interlaced,
                                          the output will be  interlaced  with
                                          the  same polarity as the source. If
                                          the source is progressive, the  out-
                                          put  will  be  interlaced  with  top
                                          field bottom field first,  depending
                                          on  which  of the Follow options you
                                          choose.

                                      ParControl -> (string)
                                          Optional. Specify  how  the  service
                                          determines  the  pixel  aspect ratio
                                          (PAR) for this output.  The  default
                                          behavior,  Follow  source  (INITIAL-
                                          IZE_FROM_SOURCE), uses the PAR  from
                                          your input video for your output. To
                                          specify a different PAR in the  con-
                                          sole,  choose  any  value other than
                                          Follow source. To specify a  differ-
                                          ent  PAR  by  editing  the  JSON job
                                          specification,   choose   SPECIFIED.
                                          When  you  choose SPECIFIED for this
                                          setting, you must also specify  val-
                                          ues  for the parNumerator and parDe-
                                          nominator settings.

                                      ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                          Required when you set  Pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (parControl) to SPECIFIED. On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you specify an output  pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (PAR)  that is different from
                                          your input video PAR,  provide  your
                                          output  PAR as a ratio. For example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify  the  ratio  40:33.  In this
                                          example, the value for  parDenomina-
                                          tor is 33.

                                      ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                          Required  when  you set Pixel aspect
                                          ratio (parControl) to SPECIFIED.  On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you  specify  an output pixel aspect
                                          ratio (PAR) that is  different  from
                                          your  input  video PAR, provide your
                                          output PAR as a ratio. For  example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the  ratio  40:33.  In  this
                                          example,  the value for parNumerator
                                          is 40.

                                      ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                                          Use this setting for interlaced out-
                                          puts, when your output frame rate is
                                          half of your input  frame  rate.  In
                                          this   situation,  choose  Optimized

                                          the Framerate setting to specify the
                                          frame rate for this output.  If  you

                                          the  input  video,   choose   Follow
                                          source. If you want to do frame rate
                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the  dropdown list or choose Custom.
                                          The framerates shown in the dropdown

                                          Choose  the  method  that  you  want
                                          MediaConvert to use when  increasing
                                          or  decreasing  the  frame  rate. We
                                          recommend   using   drop   duplicate
                                          (DUPLICATE_DROP)   for   numerically
                                          simple conversions, such as  60  fps
                                          to  30  fps. For numerically complex
                                          conversions, you can use interpolate
                                          (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This
                                          results in  a  smooth  picture,  but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts. For  complex  frame  rate
                                          conversions,   especially   if  your
                                          source video has already  been  con-
                                          verted  from  its  original cadence,
                                          use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to  do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion  method  frame  by  frame. Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding  time  and incurs a sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to  specify  the denominator of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use  1001
                                          for  the value of FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor. When you use  the  console  for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps.  Use  FramerateNumerator
                                          to  specify  the  numerator  of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When  you  use   the   console   for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                          is 29.97. Then Class 145 (CLASS_145)
                                          gives  you  an output with a bitrate
                                          of approximately 145 Mbps and  Class
                                          220 (CLASS_220) gives you and output

                                      FramerateControl -> (string)
                                          If you are using  the  console,  use
                                          the Framerate setting to specify the
                                          frame rate for this output.  If  you
                                          want  to keep the same frame rate as
                                          the  input  video,   choose   Follow
                                          source. If you want to do frame rate
                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the  dropdown list or choose Custom.
                                          The framerates shown in the dropdown
                                          list  are  decimal approximations of

                                          specify  your  frame rate as a frac-
                                          tion.  If  you  are  creating   your

                                          value the service uses for the frame
                                          rate  for  this  output. Choose INI-
                                          TIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE if you want  the
                                          service  to  use the frame rate from
                                          the input. Choose SPECIFIED  if  you
                                          want  the  service  to use the frame

                                      FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                          Choose  the  method  that  you  want
                                          MediaConvert to use when  increasing
                                          or  decreasing  the  frame  rate. We
                                          recommend   using   drop   duplicate
                                          (DUPLICATE_DROP)   for   numerically
                                          simple conversions, such as  60  fps
                                          to  30  fps. For numerically complex
                                          conversions, you can use interpolate
                                          (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This
                                          results in  a  smooth  picture,  but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts. For  complex  frame  rate
                                          conversions,   especially   if  your
                                          source video has already  been  con-
                                          verted  from  its  original cadence,
                                          use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to  do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion  method  frame  by  frame. Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding  time  and incurs a sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to  specify  the denominator of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use  1001
                                          for  the value of FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor. When you use  the  console  for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps.  Use  FramerateNumerator
                                          to  specify  the  numerator  of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When  you  use   the   console   for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                          model) in bits. For  example,  enter
                                          five megabits as 5000000.

                                      MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                          Ignore  this  setting unless you set
                                          qualityTuningLevel  to   MULTI_PASS.
                                          Optional.    Specify   the   maximum
                                          bitrate in bits/second. For example,
                                          enter  five  megabits  per second as
                                          5000000. The default  behavior  uses
                                          twice the target bitrate as the max-
                                          imum bitrate.

                                      ParControl -> (string)
                                          Optional. Specify  how  the  service
                                          determines  the  pixel  aspect ratio
                                          (PAR) for this output.  The  default
                                          behavior,  Follow  source  (INITIAL-
                                          IZE_FROM_SOURCE), uses the PAR  from
                                          your input video for your output. To
                                          specify a different PAR in the  con-
                                          sole,  choose  any  value other than
                                          Follow source. To specify a  differ-
                                          ent  PAR  by  editing  the  JSON job
                                          specification,   choose   SPECIFIED.
                                          When  you  choose SPECIFIED for this
                                          setting, you must also specify  val-
                                          ues  for the parNumerator and parDe-
                                          nominator settings.

                                      ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                          Required when you set  Pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (parControl) to SPECIFIED. On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you specify an output  pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (PAR)  that is different from
                                          your input video PAR,  provide  your
                                          output  PAR as a ratio. For example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify  the  ratio  40:33.  In this
                                          example, the value for  parDenomina-
                                          tor is 33.

                                      ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                          Required  when  you set Pixel aspect
                                          ratio (parControl) to SPECIFIED.  On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you  specify  an output pixel aspect
                                          ratio (PAR) that is  different  from
                                          your  input  video PAR, provide your
                                          output PAR as a ratio. For  example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the  ratio  40:33.  In  this
                                          example,  the value for parNumerator
                                          is 40.

                                      QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                          Optional. Use Quality  tuning  level
                                          (qualityTuningLevel)  to  choose how
                                          you want to trade off encoding speed
                                          for   output   video   quality.  The
                                          default behavior  is  faster,  lower
                                          quality, multi-pass encoding.

                                      RateControlMode -> (string)
                                          With the VP8 codec, you can use only
                                          the variable bitrate (VBR) rate con-
                                          trol mode.

                                   Vp9Settings -> (structure)
                                      Required  when  you  set  (Codec)  under
                                      (VideoDescription)>(CodecSettings)    to
                                      the value VP9.

                                      Bitrate -> (integer)
                                          Target  bitrate  in bits/second. For
                                          example,  enter  five  megabits  per
                                          second as 5000000.

                                      FramerateControl -> (string)
                                          If  you  are  using the console, use
                                          the Framerate setting to specify the
                                          frame  rate  for this output. If you
                                          want to keep the same frame rate  as
                                          the   input   video,  choose  Follow
                                          source. If you want to do frame rate
                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the dropdown list or choose  Custom.
                                          The framerates shown in the dropdown
                                          list are decimal  approximations  of
                                          fractions.  If  you  choose  Custom,
                                          specify your frame rate as  a  frac-
                                          tion.   If  you  are  creating  your
                                          transcoding job specification  as  a
                                          JSON  file  without the console, use
                                          FramerateControl  to  specify  which
                                          value the service uses for the frame
                                          rate for this  output.  Choose  INI-
                                          TIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE  if you want the
                                          service to use the frame  rate  from
                                          the  input.  Choose SPECIFIED if you
                                          want the service to  use  the  frame
                                          rate  you  specify  in  the settings
                                          FramerateNumerator and  FramerateDe-
                                          nominator.

                                      FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                          Choose  the  method  that  you  want
                                          MediaConvert  to use when increasing
                                          or decreasing  the  frame  rate.  We
                                          recommend   using   drop   duplicate
                                          (DUPLICATE_DROP)   for   numerically
                                          simple  conversions,  such as 60 fps
                                          to 30 fps. For  numerically  complex
                                          conversions, you can use interpolate
                                          (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This
                                          results  in  a  smooth  picture, but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts.  For  complex  frame rate
                                          conversions,  especially   if   your
                                          source  video  has already been con-
                                          verted from  its  original  cadence,
                                          use  FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion method  frame  by  frame.  Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to specify the denominator  of  this
                                          fraction.  In this example, use 1001
                                          for the value of  FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor.  When  you  use the console for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976  fps.  Use FramerateNumerator
                                          to specify  the  numerator  of  this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When   you   use   the  console  for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      GopSize -> (double)
                                          GOP  Length  (keyframe  interval) in
                                          frames. Must be greater than zero.

                                      HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                                          Size of buffer (HRD buffer model) in
                                          bits.   For   example,   enter  five
                                          megabits as 5000000.

                                      MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                          Ignore this setting unless  you  set
                                          qualityTuningLevel   to  MULTI_PASS.
                                          Optional.   Specify   the    maximum
                                          bitrate in bits/second. For example,
                                          enter five megabits  per  second  as
                                          5000000.  The  default behavior uses
                                          twice the target bitrate as the max-
                                          imum bitrate.

                                      ParControl -> (string)
                                          Optional.  Specify  how  the service
                                          determines the  pixel  aspect  ratio
                                          for  this output. The default behav-
                                          ior is to use the same pixel  aspect
                                          ratio as your input video.

                                      ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                          Required  when  you set Pixel aspect
                                          ratio (parControl) to SPECIFIED.  On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you  specify  an output pixel aspect
                                          ratio (PAR) that is  different  from
                                          your  input  video PAR, provide your
                                          output PAR as a ratio. For  example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the  ratio  40:33.  In  this
                                          example,  the value for parDenomina-
                                          tor is 33.

                                      ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                          Required when you set  Pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (parControl) to SPECIFIED. On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you specify an output  pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (PAR)  that is different from
                                          your input video PAR,  provide  your
                                          output  PAR as a ratio. For example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify  the  ratio  40:33.  In this
                                          example, the value for  parNumerator
                                          is 40.

                                      QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                          Optional.  Use  Quality tuning level
                                          (qualityTuningLevel) to  choose  how
                                          you want to trade off encoding speed
                                          for  output   video   quality.   The
                                          default  behavior  is  faster, lower
                                          quality, multi-pass encoding.

                                      RateControlMode -> (string)
                                          With the VP9 codec, you can use only
                                          the variable bitrate (VBR) rate con-
                                          trol mode.

                                   XavcSettings -> (structure)
                                      Required  when  you  set  (Codec)  under
                                      (VideoDescription)>(CodecSettings)    to
                                      the value XAVC.

                                      AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                                          Keep the default value, Auto (AUTO),
                                          for  this  setting to have MediaCon-
                                          vert automatically  apply  the  best

                                          content. When you want to apply your
                                          quantization  settings manually, you
                                          must   set   Adaptive   quantization
                                          (adaptiveQuantization)  to  a  value
                                          other than  Auto  (AUTO).  Use  this
                                          setting  to  specify the strength of
                                          any  adaptive  quantization  filters
                                          that  you  enable. If you don't want
                                          MediaConvert  to  do  any   adaptive
                                          quantization  in this transcode, set
                                          Adaptive quantization to Off  (OFF).

                                          Optional. Choose a specific  entropy
                                          encoding  mode only when you want to
                                          override  XAVC  recommendations.  If

                                      FramerateControl -> (string)
                                          If you are using  the  console,  use
                                          the  Frame  rate  setting to specify
                                          the frame rate for this  output.  If
                                          you want to keep the same frame rate
                                          as the input  video,  choose  Follow
                                          source. If you want to do frame rate
                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the  dropdown  list.  The framerates
                                          shown in the dropdown list are deci-

                                          service uses for the frame rate  for
                                          this    output.    Choose   INITIAL-
                                          IZE_FROM_SOURCE if you want the ser-
                                          vice  to use the frame rate from the

                                      FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                          Choose  the  method  that  you  want
                                          MediaConvert to use when  increasing
                                          or  decreasing  the  frame  rate. We
                                          recommend   using   drop   duplicate
                                          (DUPLICATE_DROP)   for   numerically
                                          simple conversions, such as  60  fps
                                          to  30  fps. For numerically complex
                                          conversions, you can use interpolate
                                          (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This
                                          results in  a  smooth  picture,  but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts. For  complex  frame  rate
                                          conversions,   especially   if  your
                                          source video has already  been  con-
                                          verted  from  its  original cadence,
                                          use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to  do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion  method  frame  by  frame. Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding  time  and incurs a sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to  specify  the denominator of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use  1001
                                          for  the value of FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor. When you use  the  console  for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Frame rate. In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =

                                          H.264 specification. Choose a  value
                                          from  17 to 128 to use planar inter-
                                          polation. Increasing values from  17
                                          to  128  result in increasing reduc-
                                          tion  of  high-frequency  data.  The
                                          value  128  results  in  the softest

                                          adjust   quantization   within  each
                                          frame based on spatial variation  of
                                          content  complexity. When you enable
                                          this feature, the encoder uses fewer
                                          bits  on areas that can sustain more
                                          distortion with no noticeable visual
                                          degradation  and  uses  more bits on
                                          areas  where  any  small  distortion
                                          will  be  noticeable.  For  example,
                                          complex textured blocks are  encoded
                                          with  fewer bits and smooth textured
                                          blocks are encoded with  more  bits.
                                          Enabling  this  feature  will almost
                                          always improve your  video  quality.

                                             when you  choose  to  change  the

                                             have  the  encoder reduce I-frame
                                             pop. I-frame  pop  appears  as  a
                                             visual  flicker  that  can  arise
                                             when the encoder  saves  bits  by
                                             copying   some  macroblocks  many
                                             times from frame  to  frame,  and
                                             then   refreshes   them   at  the
                                             I-frame.  When  you  enable  this
                                             setting,   the   encoder  updates
                                             these macroblocks  slightly  more
                                             often  to smooth out the flicker.

                                             so a decoder  joining  mid-stream
                                             will  receive  an  IDR  frame  as

                                             Specify  this  value in bits; for
                                             example, enter five  megabits  as
                                             5000000.  When you don't set this

                                             output. Keep the  default  value,
                                             Progressive (PROGRESSIVE) to cre-
                                             ate a progressive output, regard-
                                             less  of  the  scan  type of your
                                             input.  Use   Top   field   first
                                             (TOP_FIELD) or Bottom field first
                                             (BOTTOM_FIELD) to create an  out-
                                             put  that's  interlaced  with the
                                             same field  polarity  throughout.
                                             Use  Follow,  default  top  (FOL-
                                             LOW_TOP_FIELD) or Follow, default
                                             bottom  (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD)  to
                                             produce  outputs  with  the  same
                                             field polarity as the source. For
                                             jobs that have  multiple  inputs,
                                             the  output  field polarity might
                                             change over  the  course  of  the
                                             output.  Follow  behavior depends
                                             on the input scan  type.  If  the
                                             source  is interlaced, the output
                                             will be interlaced with the  same
                                             polarity  as  the  source. If the
                                             source is progressive, the output
                                             will be interlaced with top field
                                             bottom field first, depending  on
                                             which  of  the Follow options you
                                             choose.

                                          depends  on  the output's bit depth:
                                          8-bit outputs  contain  only  values

                                          through  940.  With this conversion,
                                          MediaConvert also changes the output
                                          metadata  to note the limited range.

                                             OTT Streaming, create  two  adap-
                                             tive  bitrate  (ABR)  stacks  for
                                             each asset. Do this by setting up
                                             two output groups. For one output
                                             group, set the value  of  Payload
                                             ID  (payload)  to 0 in every out-
                                             put. For the other output  group,
                                             set  Payload ID (payload) to 1 in
                                             every output.

                                          Preset -> (string)
                                             Enter  one  of  the  watermarking
                                             preset  strings  that  Nagra pro-
                                             vides  you.  Required  when   you
                                             include   Nagra   NexGuard   File
                                             Marker watermarking  (NexGuardWa-
                                             termarkingSettings)  in your job.

                                          Strength -> (string)
                                             Optional.  Ignore  this   setting
                                             unless  Nagra support directs you
                                             to  specify  a  value.  When  you
                                             don't  specify  a value here, the
                                             Nagra NexGuard library  uses  its
                                             default value.

                                   TimecodeBurnin -> (structure)
                                      Settings for burning the output timecode
                                      and specified prefix into the output.

                                      FontSize -> (integer)
                                          Use Font Size (FontSize) to set  the
                                          font size of any burned-in timecode.
                                          Valid values are 10, 16, 32, 48.

                                      Position -> (string)
                                          Use Position (Position) under  under
                                          Timecode burn-in (TimecodeBurnIn) to
                                          specify the location  the  burned-in
                                          timecode on output video.

                                      Prefix -> (string)
                                          Use  Prefix  (Prefix) to place ASCII
                                          characters  before   any   burned-in
                                          timecode.  For  example, a prefix of
                                          "EZ-" will result  in  the  timecode
                                          "EZ-00:00:00:00". Provide either the
                                          characters themselves or  the  ASCII
                                          code   equivalents.   The  supported
                                          range of characters is 0x20  through
                                          0x7e.  This  includes  letters, num-
                                          bers,  and  all  special  characters
                                          represented  on  a  standard English
                                          keyboard.

                               Width -> (integer)
                                   Use Width (Width) to define the video reso-
                                   lution  width,  in pixels, for this output.
                                   If you don't provide a value here, the ser-
                                   vice will use the input width.

              TimecodeConfig -> (structure)
                 These  settings  control  how  the  service handles timecodes
                 throughout the job. These settings don't affect  input  clip-
                 ping.

                 Anchor -> (string)
                     If  you  use an editing platform that relies on an anchor
                     timecode, use Anchor Timecode (Anchor) to specify a time-
                     code  that will match the input video frame to the output
                     video  frame.  Use  24-hour  format  with  frame  number,
                     (HH:MM:SS:FF)  or  (HH:MM:SS;FF).  This  setting  ignores
                     frame rate conversion. System behavior for  Anchor  Time-
                     code  varies  depending on your setting for Source (Time-
                     codeSource). * If Source (TimecodeSource) is set to Spec-
                     ified  Start  (SPECIFIEDSTART),  the first input frame is
                     the specified value in  Start  Timecode  (Start).  Anchor
                     Timecode  (Anchor)  and  Start  Timecode (Start) are used
                     calculate output timecode. * If  Source  (TimecodeSource)
                     is  set  to  Start  at  0  (ZEROBASED) the first frame is
                     00:00:00:00. *  If  Source  (TimecodeSource)  is  set  to
                     Embedded  (EMBEDDED),  the  first  frame  is the timecode
                     value on the first input frame of the input.

                 Source -> (string)
                     Use Source (TimecodeSource) to set how timecodes are han-
                     dled  within  this  job.  To  make  sure that your video,
                     audio, captions, and markers are  synchronized  and  that
                     time-based  features,  such  as image inserter, work cor-
                     rectly, choose the Timecode source  option  that  matches
                     your  assets.  All timecodes are in a 24-hour format with
                     frame number (HH:MM:SS:FF). * Embedded (EMBEDDED)  -  Use
                     the  timecode  that is in the input video. If no embedded
                     timecode is in the source, the service will use Start  at
                     0 (ZEROBASED) instead. * Start at 0 (ZEROBASED) - Set the
                     timecode of the initial frame to 00:00:00:00. * Specified
                     Start  (SPECIFIEDSTART) - Set the timecode of the initial
                     frame to a value other than zero. You use Start  timecode
                     (Start) to provide this value.

                 Start -> (string)
                     Only  use  when you set Source (TimecodeSource) to Speci-
                     fied start (SPECIFIEDSTART). Use Start  timecode  (Start)
                     to  specify  the  timecode  for  the  initial  frame. Use
                     24-hour  format  with  frame  number,  (HH:MM:SS:FF)   or
                     (HH:MM:SS;FF).

                 TimestampOffset -> (string)
                     Only  applies  to  outputs that support program-date-time
                     stamp. Use Timestamp offset  (TimestampOffset)  to  over-
                     write  the  timecode  date without affecting the time and
                     frame number. Provide the new date as  a  string  in  the
                     format  "yyyy-mm-dd".  To use Time stamp offset, you must
                     also enable Insert program-date-time  (InsertProgramDate-
                     Time)  in  the  output settings. For example, if the date
                     part of your timecodes  is  2002-1-25  and  you  want  to
                     change it to one year later, set Timestamp offset (Times-
                     tampOffset) to 2003-1-25.

              TimedMetadataInsertion -> (structure)
                 Enable Timed metadata insertion  (TimedMetadataInsertion)  to
                 include  ID3  tags in any HLS outputs. To include timed meta-
                 data, you must enable it here, enable it in each output  con-
                 tainer,  and  specify  tags  and  timecodes  in ID3 insertion
                 (Id3Insertion) objects.

                 Id3Insertions -> (list)
                     Id3Insertions  contains   the   array   of   Id3Insertion
                     instances.

                     (structure)
                        To insert ID3 tags in your output, specify two values.
                        Use ID3 tag (Id3)  to  specify  the  base  64  encoded
                        string and use Timecode (TimeCode) to specify the time
                        when the tag should be inserted.  To  insert  multiple
                        ID3  tags in your output, create multiple instances of
                        ID3 insertion (Id3Insertion).

                        Id3 -> (string)
                            Use ID3 tag  (Id3)  to  provide  a  tag  value  in
                            base64-encode format.

                        Timecode -> (string)
                            Provide  a  Timecode  (TimeCode) in HH:MM:SS:FF or
                            HH:MM:SS;FF format.

          StatusUpdateInterval -> (string)
              Specify how often MediaConvert  sends  STATUS_UPDATE  events  to
              Amazon  CloudWatch Events. Set the interval, in seconds, between
              status updates. MediaConvert sends an update  at  this  interval
              from the time the service begins processing your job to the time
              it completes the transcode or encounters an error.

          Type -> (string)
              A job template can be of two types: system or custom. System  or
              built-in job templates can't be modified or deleted by the user.
