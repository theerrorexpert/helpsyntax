LIST-JOB-TEMPLATES()                                      LIST-JOB-TEMPLATES()



NAME
       list-job-templates -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieve  a JSON array of up to twenty of your job templates. This will
       return the templates themselves, not just a list of them.  To  retrieve
       the  next  twenty templates, use the nextToken string returned with the
       array

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-job-templates is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: JobTemplates

SYNOPSIS
            list-job-templates
          [--category <value>]
          [--list-by <value>]
          [--order <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --category  (string)  Optionally,  specify  a  job template category to
       limit responses to only job templates from that category.

       --list-by (string) Optional. When you request a list of job  templates,
       you  can  choose to list them alphabetically by NAME or chronologically
       by CREATION_DATE. If you don't specify, the service will list  them  by
       name.
          Possible values:

          o NAME

          o CREATION_DATE

          o SYSTEM

       --order (string) Optional. When you request lists of resources, you can
       specify whether they are  sorted  in  ASCENDING  or  DESCENDING  order.
       Default varies by resource.
          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       JobTemplates -> (list)
          List of Job templates.

          (structure)
              A job template is a pre-made set of encoding  instructions  that
              you can use to quickly create a job.

              AccelerationSettings -> (structure)
                 Accelerated  transcoding can significantly speed up jobs with
                 long, visually complex content.

                 Mode -> (string)
                     Specify the conditions when the service will run your job
                     with accelerated transcoding.

              Arn -> (string)
                 An  identifier for this resource that is unique within all of
                 AWS.

              Category -> (string)
                 An optional category you create to  organize  your  job  tem-
                 plates.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp in epoch seconds for Job template creation.

              Description -> (string)
                 An optional description you create for each job template.

              HopDestinations -> (list)
                 Optional list of hop destinations.

                 (structure)
                     Optional.  Configuration for a destination queue to which
                     the job can hop once a customer-defined minimum wait time
                     has passed.

                     Priority -> (integer)
                        Optional.  When you set up a job to use queue hopping,
                        you can specify a different relative priority for  the
                        job  in  the  destination queue. If you don't specify,
                        the relative priority will remain the same as  in  the
                        previous queue.

                     Queue -> (string)
                        Optional  unless  the  job is submitted on the default
                        queue. When you set up a job to use queue hopping, you
                        can  specify a destination queue. This queue cannot be
                        the original queue to which the job is  submitted.  If
                        the  original  queue  isn't  the default queue and you
                        don't specify the destination queue, the job will move
                        to the default queue.

                     WaitMinutes -> (integer)
                        Required  for  setting  up a job to use queue hopping.
                        Minimum wait time in minutes until the job can hop  to
                        the  destination  queue. Valid range is 1 to 1440 min-
                        utes, inclusive.

              LastUpdated -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp in epoch seconds when the Job template was last
                 updated.

              Name -> (string)
                 A  name  you  create for each job template. Each name must be
                 unique within your account.

              Priority -> (integer)
                 Relative priority on the job.

              Queue -> (string)
                 Optional. The queue that jobs created from this template  are
                 assigned  to.  If you don't specify this, jobs will go to the
                 default queue.

              Settings -> (structure)
                 JobTemplateSettings contains all the transcode settings saved
                 in the template that will be applied to jobs created from it.

                 AdAvailOffset -> (integer)
                     When specified, this offset (in milliseconds) is added to
                     the input Ad Avail PTS time.

                 AvailBlanking -> (structure)
                     Settings  for  ad avail blanking. Video can be blanked or
                     overlaid with an image, and audio  muted  during  SCTE-35
                     triggered ad avails.

                     AvailBlankingImage -> (string)
                        Blanking  image  to  be  used.  Leave  empty for solid
                        black. Only bmp and png images are supported.

                 Esam -> (structure)
                     Settings for Event Signaling And Messaging (ESAM). If you
                     don't do ad insertion, you can ignore these settings.

                     ManifestConfirmConditionNotification -> (structure)
                        Specifies an ESAM ManifestConfirmConditionNotification
                        XML as per OC-SP-ESAM-API-I03-131025.  The  transcoder
                        uses  the  manifest conditioning instructions that you
                        provide in the setting MCC XML (mccXml).

                        MccXml -> (string)
                            Provide your ESAM  ManifestConfirmConditionNotifi-
                            cation XML document inside your JSON job settings.
                            Form     the     XML     document      as      per
                            OC-SP-ESAM-API-I03-131025. The transcoder will use
                            the Manifest Conditioning instructions in the mes-
                            sage that you supply.

                     ResponseSignalPreroll -> (integer)
                        Specifies   the   stream  distance,  in  milliseconds,
                        between the  SCTE  35  messages  that  the  transcoder
                        places  and  the  splice points that they refer to. If
                        the time between  the  start  of  the  asset  and  the
                        SCTE-35  message  is  less  than  this value, then the
                        transcoder places the SCTE-35 marker at the  beginning
                        of the stream.

                     SignalProcessingNotification -> (structure)
                        Specifies  an ESAM SignalProcessingNotification XML as
                        per OC-SP-ESAM-API-I03-131025. The transcoder uses the
                        signal processing instructions that you provide in the
                        setting SCC XML (sccXml).

                        SccXml -> (string)
                            Provide your ESAM SignalProcessingNotification XML
                            document  inside  your JSON job settings. Form the
                            XML document as per OC-SP-ESAM-API-I03-131025. The
                            transcoder will use the signal processing instruc-
                            tions in the message that you supply. Provide your
                            ESAM   SignalProcessingNotification  XML  document
                            inside your JSON job settings. For  your  MPEG2-TS
                            file  outputs,  if  you  want the service to place
                            SCTE-35 markers at the insertion points you  spec-
                            ify  in  the  XML  document,  you must also enable
                            SCTE-35  ESAM  (scte35Esam).  Note  that  you  can
                            either  specify  an  ESAM  XML  document or enable
                            SCTE-35 passthrough. You can't do both.

                 ExtendedDataServices -> (structure)
                     If your source content has EIA-608 Line 21 Data Services,
                     enable  this  feature  to  specify what MediaConvert does
                     with the Extended Data Services (XDS)  packets.  You  can
                     choose  to  pass through XDS packets, or remove them from
                     the output. For more information about XDS,  see  EIA-608
                     Line Data Services, section 9.5.1.5 05h Content Advisory.

                     CopyProtectionAction -> (string)
                        The action to take on copy and redistribution  control
                        XDS  packets.  If you select PASSTHROUGH, packets will
                        not be changed. If you select STRIP, any packets  will
                        be removed in output captions.

                     VchipAction -> (string)
                        The action to take on content advisory XDS packets. If
                        you select PASSTHROUGH, packets will not  be  changed.
                        If  you  select  STRIP, any packets will be removed in
                        output captions.

                 Inputs -> (list)
                     Use Inputs (inputs) to define the source file used in the
                     transcode  job. There can only be one input in a job tem-
                     plate. Using the API, you  can  include  multiple  inputs
                     when referencing a job template.

                     (structure)
                        Specified video input in a template.

                        AudioSelectorGroups -> (map)
                            Use  audio  selector  groups  to  combine multiple
                            sidecar audio inputs so that you can  assign  them
                            to  a  single output audio tab (AudioDescription).
                            Note that, if you're working with embedded  audio,
                            it's  simpler to assign multiple input tracks into
                            a single audio selector rather than use  an  audio
                            selector group.

                            key -> (string)

                            value -> (structure)
                               Use  audio  selector groups to combine multiple
                               sidecar audio inputs so  that  you  can  assign
                               them  to  a  single  output audio tab (AudioDe-
                               scription). Note that, if you're  working  with
                               embedded audio, it's simpler to assign multiple
                               input  tracks  into  a  single  audio  selector
                               rather than use an audio selector group.

                               AudioSelectorNames -> (list)
                                   Name  of  an Audio Selector within the same
                                   input to include in the group. Audio selec-
                                   tor  names are standardized, based on their
                                   order within the input (e.g., "Audio Selec-
                                   tor  1"). The audio selector name parameter
                                   can be repeated to add any number of  audio
                                   selectors to the group.

                                   (string)

                        AudioSelectors -> (map)
                            Use  Audio selectors (AudioSelectors) to specify a
                            track or set of tracks from  the  input  that  you
                            will  use  in  your  outputs. You can use multiple
                            Audio selectors per input.

                            key -> (string)

                            value -> (structure)
                               Use Audio selectors (AudioSelectors) to specify
                               a  track  or  set of tracks from the input that
                               you will use in your outputs. You can use  mul-
                               tiple Audio selectors per input.

                               CustomLanguageCode -> (string)
                                   Selects   a  specific  language  code  from
                                   within an audio source, using the ISO 639-2
                                   or ISO 639-3 three-letter language code

                               DefaultSelection -> (string)
                                   Enable  this  setting on one audio selector
                                   to set it as the default for the  job.  The
                                   service uses this default for outputs where
                                   it can't find the specified input audio. If
                                   you don't set a default, those outputs have
                                   no audio.

                               ExternalAudioFileInput -> (string)
                                   Specifies audio data from an external  file
                                   source.

                               HlsRenditionGroupSettings -> (structure)
                                   Settings  specific  to  audio sources in an
                                   HLS alternate rendition group. Specify  the
                                   properties (renditionGroupId, renditionName
                                   or renditionLanguageCode) to  identify  the
                                   unique  audio  track  among the alternative
                                   rendition groups present in the  HLS  mani-
                                   fest.  If no unique track is found, or mul-
                                   tiple tracks match the properties provided,
                                   the  job fails. If no properties in hlsRen-
                                   ditionGroupSettings  are   specified,   the
                                   default  audio  track within the video seg-
                                   ment is chosen. If there is no audio within
                                   video  segment,  the alternative audio with
                                   DEFAULT=YES is chosen instead.

                                   RenditionGroupId -> (string)
                                      Optional. Specify alternative group ID

                                   RenditionLanguageCode -> (string)
                                      Optional. Specify ISO 639-2 or ISO 639-3
                                      code in the language property

                                   RenditionName -> (string)
                                      Optional. Specify media name

                               LanguageCode -> (string)
                                   Selects   a  specific  language  code  from
                                   within an audio source.

                               Offset -> (integer)
                                   Specifies a time delta in  milliseconds  to
                                   offset the audio from the input video.

                               Pids -> (list)
                                   Selects a specific PID from within an audio
                                   source (e.g. 257 selects PID 0x101).

                                   (integer)

                               ProgramSelection -> (integer)
                                   Use this setting  for  input  streams  that
                                   contain   Dolby  E,  to  have  the  service
                                   extract  specific  program  data  from  the
                                   track.  To select multiple programs, create
                                   multiple selectors with the same Track  and
                                   different  Program numbers. In the console,
                                   this setting is visible when you set Selec-
                                   tor  type to Track. Choose the program num-
                                   ber from the  dropdown  list.  If  you  are
                                   sending  a  JSON  file, provide the program
                                   ID, which is part of the audio metadata. If
                                   your input file has incorrect metadata, you
                                   can choose All channels instead of  a  pro-
                                   gram  number to have the service ignore the
                                   program IDs and include all the programs in
                                   the track.

                               RemixSettings -> (structure)
                                   Use  these  settings  to  reorder the audio
                                   channels of one input  to  match  those  of
                                   another  input.  This allows you to combine
                                   the two files into  a  single  output,  one
                                   after the other.

                                   ChannelMapping -> (structure)
                                      Channel  mapping  (ChannelMapping)  con-
                                      tains the group of fields that hold  the
                                      remixing  value for each channel, in dB.
                                      Specify remix  values  to  indicate  how
                                      much  of  the  content  from  your input
                                      audio channel you want  in  your  output
                                      audio  channels.  Each  instance  of the
                                      InputChannels  or  InputChannelsFineTune
                                      array  specifies  these  values  for one
                                      output channel. Use one instance of this
                                      array  for  each  output channel. In the
                                      console, each  array  corresponds  to  a
                                      column in the graphical depiction of the
                                      mapping matrix. The rows of the  graphi-
                                      cal matrix correspond to input channels.
                                      Valid values are within the  range  from
                                      -60  (mute)  through  6.  A setting of 0
                                      passes the input  channel  unchanged  to
                                      the  output  channel  (no attenuation or
                                      amplification).  Use  InputChannels   or
                                      InputChannelsFineTune  to  specify  your
                                      remix values. Don't use both.

                                      OutputChannels -> (list)
                                          In  your  JSON  job   specification,
                                          include  one child of OutputChannels

                                      input  caption source file. If your cap-
                                      tion source is IMSC in an  IMF  package,
                                      use TrackSourceSettings instead of File-
                                      SoureSettings.

                                      Convert608To708 -> (string)
                                          Specify whether this  set  of  input
                                          captions  appears in your outputs in
                                          both 608  and  708  format.  If  you
                                          choose Upconvert (UPCONVERT), Media-
                                          Convert includes the  captions  data
                                          in  two ways: it passes the 608 data
                                          through using the 608  compatibility
                                          bytes fields of the 708 wrapper, and
                                          it also translates the 608 data into
                                          708.

                                      Framerate -> (structure)
                                          Ignore   this  setting  unless  your
                                          input captions  format  is  SCC.  To

                                          input   captions  and  input  video,
                                          specify the frame rate of  the  cap-
                                          tions  file. Specify this value as a
                                          fraction. When you work directly  in
                                          your JSON job specification, use the
                                          settings   framerateNumerator    and
                                          framerateDenominator.  For  example,
                                          you might specify 24 / 1 for 24 fps,
                                          25  / 1 for 25 fps, 24000 / 1001 for
                                          23.976 fps,  or  30000  /  1001  for
                                          29.97 fps.

                                          FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                             Specify  the  denominator  of the
                                             fraction  that   represents   the
                                             frame  rate  for the setting Cap-

                                          FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                             Specify  the  numerator  of   the
                                             fraction   that   represents  the

                                      SourceFile -> (string)
                                          External caption file used for load-
                                          ing captions. Accepted  file  exten-

                                      TimeDelta -> (integer)
                                          Optional.  Use this setting when you
                                          need to adjust the sync between your
                                          sidecar captions and your video. For
                                          more        information,         see
                                          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/time-delta-use-cases.html.
                                          Enter a positive or negative  number
                                          to  modify the times in the captions
                                          file. For example, type 15 to add 15
                                          seconds to all the times in the cap-
                                          tions file. Type -5  to  subtract  5
                                          seconds  from  the times in the cap-
                                          tions file. You can optionally spec-
                                          ify  your time delta in milliseconds
                                          instead of seconds. When you do  so,
                                          set  the related setting, Time delta
                                          units (TimeDeltaUnits) to  Millisec-
                                          onds (MILLISECONDS). Note that, when
                                          you specify a time delta  for  time-
                                          code-based  caption sources, such as
                                          SCC and STL,  and  your  time  delta
                                          isn't  a multiple of the input frame
                                          rate, MediaConvert  snaps  the  cap-
                                          tions  to  the  nearest  frame.  For
                                          example, when your input video frame
                                          rate  is  25  fps  and  you  specify
                                          1010ms for time delta,  MediaConvert
                                          delays your captions by 1000 ms.

                                      TimeDeltaUnits -> (string)
                                          When  you use the setting Time delta
                                          (TimeDelta)  to  adjust   the   sync
                                          between  your  sidecar  captions and
                                          your  video,  use  this  setting  to
                                          specify the units for the delta that
                                          you specify. When you don't  specify
                                          a   value   for   Time  delta  units
                                          (TimeDeltaUnits), MediaConvert  uses
                                          seconds by default.

                                   SourceType -> (string)
                                      Use  Source (SourceType) to identify the
                                      format of your input captions. The  ser-
                                      vice  cannot auto-detect caption format.

                                   TeletextSourceSettings -> (structure)
                                      Settings specific  to  Teletext  caption
                                      sources, including Page number.

                                      PageNumber -> (string)
                                          Use   Page  Number  (PageNumber)  to
                                          specify the three-digit  hexadecimal
                                          page  number  that  will be used for
                                          Teletext captions. Do not  use  this
                                          setting  if  you are passing through
                                          teletext from the  input  source  to
                                          output.

                                   TrackSourceSettings -> (structure)
                                      Settings  specific  to  caption  sources
                                      that are specified by track number. Cur-
                                      rently, this is only IMSC captions in an
                                      IMF package. If your caption  source  is
                                      IMSC  1.1  in  a  separate xml file, use
                                      FileSourceSettings  instead  of   Track-
                                      SourceSettings.

                                      TrackNumber -> (integer)
                                          Use  this setting to select a single
                                          captions track from a source.  Track
                                          numbers  correspond  to the order in
                                          the captions source  file.  For  IMF
                                          sources, track numbering is based on
                                          the order that the  captions  appear
                                          in  the  CPL.  For example, use 1 to
                                          select the captions  asset  that  is
                                          listed  first in the CPL. To include
                                          more than one captions track in your
                                          job  outputs,  create multiple input
                                          captions  selectors.   Specify   one
                                          track per selector.

                                   WebvttHlsSourceSettings -> (structure)
                                      Settings  specific  to WebVTT sources in
                                      HLS alternative rendition group. Specify
                                      the properties (renditionGroupId, rendi-
                                      tionName  or  renditionLanguageCode)  to
                                      identify the unique subtitle track among
                                      the alternative rendition groups present
                                      in  the HLS manifest. If no unique track
                                      is found, or multiple tracks  match  the
                                      specified  properties, the job fails. If
                                      there is only one subtitle track in  the
                                      rendition  group,  the  settings  can be
                                      left  empty  and  the  default  subtitle
                                      track  will  be  chosen. If your caption
                                      source is  a  sidecar  file,  use  File-
                                      SourceSettings     instead    of    Web-
                                      vttHlsSourceSettings.

                            area  that  the service will include in the output
                            video frame. If you specify a value here, it  will
                            override  any value that you specify in the output
                            setting Cropping selection (crop).

                            Height -> (integer)
                               Height of rectangle  in  pixels.  Specify  only
                               even numbers.

                            Width -> (integer)
                               Width of rectangle in pixels. Specify only even
                               numbers.

                            X -> (integer)
                               The distance, in pixels, between the  rectangle
                               and  the  left edge of the video frame. Specify
                               only even numbers.

                            Y -> (integer)
                               The distance, in pixels, between the  rectangle
                               and  the  top  edge of the video frame. Specify
                               only even numbers.

                        DeblockFilter -> (string)
                            Enable  Deblock  (InputDeblockFilter)  to  produce
                            smoother  motion  in  the  output. Default is dis-
                            abled. Only manually controllable  for  MPEG2  and
                            uncompressed video inputs.

                        DenoiseFilter -> (string)
                            Enable   Denoise  (InputDenoiseFilter)  to  filter
                            noise from the input. Default  is  disabled.  Only
                            applicable  to  MPEG2,  H.264,  H.265,  and uncom-
                            pressed video inputs.

                        DolbyVisionMetadataXml -> (string)
                            Use this setting only when your video  source  has
                            Dolby  Vision  studio  mastering  metadata that is
                            carried in a separate XML file. Specify the Amazon
                            S3  location  for the metadata XML file. MediaCon-
                            vert  uses  this  file  to  provide   global   and
                            frame-level  metadata for Dolby Vision preprocess-
                            ing. When you specify a file here and  your  input
                            also  has interleaved global and frame level meta-
                            data, MediaConvert ignores the  interleaved  meta-
                            data  and  uses  only  the  the metadata from this
                            external XML file. Note that your IAM service role
                            must  grant  MediaConvert read permissions to this
                            file.     For      more      information,      see
                            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/iam-role.html.

                        FilterEnable -> (string)
                            Specify how the transcoding  service  applies  the
                            denoise  and deblock filters. You must also enable
                            the filters  separately,  with  Denoise  (InputDe-
                            noiseFilter)  and  Deblock (InputDeblockFilter). *
                            Auto - The transcoding service determines  whether
                            to  apply  filtering,  depending on input type and
                            quality. * Disable - The input  is  not  filtered.
                            This  is  true  even  if you use the API to enable
                            them in (InputDeblockFilter) and (InputDeblockFil-
                            ter).  *  Force - The input is filtered regardless
                            of input type.

                        FilterStrength -> (integer)
                            Use Filter strength (FilterStrength) to adjust the
                            magnitude  the  input filter settings (Deblock and
                            Denoise). The range is -5 to 5. Default is 0.

                        ImageInserter -> (structure)
                            Enable the image inserter  feature  to  include  a
                            graphic  overlay  on your video. Enable or disable
                            this feature for  each  input  individually.  This
                            setting is disabled by default.

                            InsertableImages -> (list)
                               Specify  the images that you want to overlay on
                               your video. The  images  must  be  PNG  or  TGA
                               files.

                               (structure)
                                   These  settings apply to a specific graphic
                                   overlay. You can include multiple  overlays
                                   in your job.

                                   Duration -> (integer)
                                      Specify  the  time, in milliseconds, for
                                      the image to remain on the output video.
                                      This  duration includes fade-in time but
                                      not fade-out time.

                                   FadeIn -> (integer)
                                      Specify the length of time, in millisec-
                                      onds,  between  the  Start time that you
                                      specify for the image insertion and  the
                                      time  that  the  image  appears  at full
                                      opacity. Full opacity is the level  that
                                      you  specify for the opacity setting. If
                                      you don't specify a value  for  Fade-in,
                                      the  image  will  appear abruptly at the
                                      overlay start time.

                                   FadeOut -> (integer)
                                      Specify the length of time, in millisec-
                                      onds,  between  the end of the time that
                                      you have specified for the image overlay
                                      Duration and when the overlaid image has
                                      faded  to  total  transparency.  If  you
                                      don't  specify a value for Fade-out, the
                                      image will disappear abruptly at the end
                                      of the inserted image duration.

                                   Height -> (integer)
                                      Specify the height of the inserted image
                                      in pixels. If you specify a value that's
                                      larger than the video resolution height,
                                      the  service  will  crop  your  overlaid
                                      image  to  fit. To use the native height
                                      of the image, keep this setting blank.

                                   ImageInserterInput -> (string)
                                      Specify the HTTP, HTTPS,  or  Amazon  S3
                                      location  of  the image that you want to
                                      overlay on the video. Use a PNG  or  TGA
                                      file.

                                   ImageX -> (integer)
                                      Specify the distance, in pixels, between
                                      the inserted image and the left edge  of
                                      the  video frame. Required for any image
                                      overlay that you specify.

                                   ImageY -> (integer)
                                      Specify the distance, in pixels, between
                                      the  overlaid  image and the top edge of
                                      the video frame. Required for any  image
                                      overlay that you specify.

                                   Layer -> (integer)
                                      Specify  how overlapping inserted images
                                      appear. Images with  higher  values  for
                                      Layer appear on top of images with lower
                                      values for Layer.

                                   Opacity -> (integer)
                                      Use Opacity  (Opacity)  to  specify  how
                                      much   of  the  underlying  video  shows
                                      through the inserted image. 0 is  trans-
                                      parent  and 100 is fully opaque. Default
                                      is 50.

                                   StartTime -> (string)
                                      Specify the timecode of the  frame  that
                                      you want the overlay to first appear on.
                                      This must be in timecode (HH:MM:SS:FF or
                                      HH:MM:SS;FF)  format.  Remember  to take
                                      into account your timecode  source  set-
                                      tings.

                                   Width -> (integer)
                                      Specify  the width of the inserted image
                                      in pixels. If you specify a value that's
                                      larger  than the video resolution width,
                                      the  service  will  crop  your  overlaid
                                      image to fit. To use the native width of
                                      the image, keep this setting blank.

                        InputClippings -> (list)
                            (InputClippings) contains sets of  start  and  end
                            times that together specify a portion of the input
                            to be used in the outputs. If you provide  only  a
                            start time, the clip will be the entire input from
                            that point to the end. If you provide only an  end
                            time,  it  will  be  the  entire  input up to that
                            point. When you specify more than one input  clip,
                            the transcoding service creates the job outputs by
                            stringing the clips  together  in  the  order  you
                            specify them.

                            (structure)
                               To  transcode  only  portions  of  your  input,
                               include one input clip for each  part  of  your
                               input  that  you want in your output. All input
                               clips that you  specify  will  be  included  in
                               every  output of the job. For more information,
                               see
                               https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/assembling-multiple-inputs-and-input-clips.html.

                               EndTimecode -> (string)
                                   Set End timecode (EndTimecode) to  the  end
                                   of  the  portion of the input you are clip-
                                   ping. The frame corresponding  to  the  End
                                   timecode  value  is  included  in the clip.
                                   Start timecode or End timecode may be  left
                                   blank,   but   not  both.  Use  the  format
                                   HH:MM:SS:FF or HH:MM:SS;FF, where HH is the
                                   hour,  MM  is the minute, SS is the second,
                                   and FF is the frame number.  When  choosing
                                   this  value, take into account your setting
                                   for timecode source  under  input  settings
                                   (InputTimecodeSource).  For example, if you
                                   have  embedded  timecodes  that  start   at
                                   01:00:00:00  and  you want your clip to end
                                   six   minutes   into   the    video,    use
                                   01:06:00:00.

                               StartTimecode -> (string)
                                   Set  Start  timecode (StartTimecode) to the
                                   beginning of the portion of the  input  you
                                   are  clipping.  The  frame corresponding to
                                   the Start timecode value is included in the
                                   clip. Start timecode or End timecode may be
                                   left blank, but not both.  Use  the  format
                                   HH:MM:SS:FF or HH:MM:SS;FF, where HH is the
                                   hour, MM is the minute, SS is  the  second,
                                   and  FF  is the frame number. When choosing
                                   this value, take into account your  setting
                                   for  Input timecode source. For example, if
                                   you have embedded timecodes that  start  at
                                   01:00:00:00 and you want your clip to begin
                                   five   minutes   into   the   video,    use
                                   01:05:00:00.

                        InputScanType -> (string)
                            When  you have a progressive segmented frame (PsF)
                            input, use this setting to flag the input as  PsF.
                            MediaConvert  doesn't  automatically  detect  PsF.
                            Therefore, flagging your input as PsF  results  in
                            better  preservation  of video quality when you do
                            deinterlacing and frame rate  conversion.  If  you
                            don't  specify,  the default value is Auto (AUTO).
                            Auto is the correct setting for  all  inputs  that
                            are not PsF. Don't set this value to PsF when your
                            input is interlaced. Doing so  creates  horizontal
                            interlacing artifacts.

                        Position -> (structure)
                            Use  Selection  placement (position) to define the
                            video area in your output frame. The area  outside
                            of  the  rectangle that you specify here is black.
                            If you specify a value here, it will override  any
                            value  that  you  specify  in  the  output setting
                            Selection placement (position). If you  specify  a
                            value  here,  this will override any AFD values in
                            your  input,  even  if  you  set  Respond  to  AFD
                            (RespondToAfd)  to Respond (RESPOND). If you spec-
                            ify a value here, this will ignore  anything  that
                            you  specify  for  the  setting  Scaling  Behavior
                            (scalingBehavior).

                            Height -> (integer)
                               Height of rectangle  in  pixels.  Specify  only
                               even numbers.

                            Width -> (integer)
                               Width of rectangle in pixels. Specify only even
                               numbers.

                            X -> (integer)
                               The distance, in pixels, between the  rectangle
                               and  the  left edge of the video frame. Specify
                               only even numbers.

                            Y -> (integer)
                               The distance, in pixels, between the  rectangle
                               and  the  top  edge of the video frame. Specify
                               only even numbers.

                        ProgramNumber -> (integer)
                            Use Program (programNumber) to select  a  specific
                            program  from  within  a  multi-program  transport
                            stream. Note that Quad 4K is  not  currently  sup-
                            ported.  Default  is  the first program within the
                            transport  stream.  If  the  program  you  specify
                            doesn't  exist,  the  transcoding service will use
                            this default.

                        PsiControl -> (string)
                            Set PSI control  (InputPsiControl)  for  transport
                            stream  inputs  to  specify  which  data the demux
                            process to scans. * Ignore PSI - Scan all PIDs for
                            audio and video. * Use PSI - Scan only PSI data.

                        TimecodeSource -> (string)
                            Use  this  Timecode  source setting, located under
                            the input settings (InputTimecodeSource), to spec-
                            ify  how  the  service  counts input video frames.
                            This input frame count affects only  the  behavior
                            of  features  that  apply  to  a single input at a
                            time, such as  input  clipping  and  synchronizing
                            some  captions formats. Choose Embedded (EMBEDDED)
                            to use the timecodes in your input  video.  Choose
                            Start at zero (ZEROBASED) to start the first frame
                            at zero. Choose Specified  start  (SPECIFIEDSTART)
                            to  start the first frame at the timecode that you
                            specify  in  the  setting  Start  timecode  (time-
                            codeStart). If you don't specify a value for Time-
                            code source, the  service  will  use  Embedded  by
                            default. For more information about timecodes, see
                            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/mediaconvert/timecode.

                        TimecodeStart -> (string)
                            Specify  the timecode that you want the service to
                            use for this input's initial frame.  To  use  this
                            setting, you must set the Timecode source setting,
                            located under the input settings  (InputTimecodeS-
                            ource),  to  Specified start (SPECIFIEDSTART). For
                            more    information    about    timecodes,     see

                        VideoSelector -> (structure)
                            Input video selectors contain the  video  settings
                            for  the input. Each of your inputs can have up to
                            one video selector.

                            AlphaBehavior -> (string)
                               Ignore this setting  unless  this  input  is  a
                               QuickTime  animation with an alpha channel. Use
                               this setting to create separate  Key  and  Fill
                               outputs.  In each output, specify which part of
                               the input MediaConvert uses. Leave this setting
                               at  the  default  value  DISCARD  to delete the
                               alpha channel and preserve the video. Set it to
                               REMAP_TO_LUMA  to  delete the video and map the
                               alpha channel to the luma channel of your  out-
                               puts.

                            ColorSpace -> (string)
                               If  your  input  video has accurate color space
                               metadata, or if  you  don't  know  about  color
                               space, leave this set to the default value Fol-
                               low (FOLLOW). The  service  will  automatically
                               detect  your  input  color space. If your input
                               video has metadata indicating the  wrong  color
                               space,  specify  the accurate color space here.
                               If your input video is HDR 10 and the SMPTE  ST

                               choose Force  HDR  10  (FORCE_HDR10)  here  and
                               specify  correct  values  in  the  input HDR 10
                               metadata  (Hdr10Metadata)  settings.  For  more

                            ColorSpaceUsage -> (string)
                               There  are  two sources for color metadata, the
                               input file and the  job  input  settings  Color
                               space   (ColorSpace)  and  HDR  master  display
                               information settings(Hdr10Metadata). The  Color
                               space  usage  setting  determines  which  takes
                               precedence. Choose Force (FORCE) to  use  color
                               metadata  from  the  input job settings. If you
                               don't specify values for  those  settings,  the
                               service  defaults  to  using metadata from your
                               input. FALLBACK - Choose Fallback (FALLBACK) to
                               use  color  metadata from the source when it is
                               present. If there's no color metadata  in  your
                               input  file, the service defaults to using val-
                               ues you specify in the input settings.

                            Hdr10Metadata -> (structure)
                               Use these settings to provide HDR  10  metadata
                               that  is  missing  or  inaccurate in your input
                               video. Appropriate values vary depending on the
                               input  video  and  must  be provided by a color
                               grader. The color grader generates these values
                               during  the HDR 10 mastering process. The valid
                               range for  each  of  these  settings  is  0  to
                               50,000.  Each  increment  represents 0.00002 in
                               CIE1931 color coordinate.  Related  settings  -
                               When  you  specify  these values, you must also
                               set Color space (ColorSpace) to HDR 10 (HDR10).

                            Pid -> (integer)
                               Use  PID  (Pid)  to  select specific video data
                               from an input file. Specify this  value  as  an
                               integer;  the  system automatically converts it
                               to the  hexidecimal  value.  For  example,  257
                               selects PID 0x101. A PID, or packet identifier,
                               is an identifier for a set of data in an MPEG-2
                               transport stream container.

                            ProgramNumber -> (integer)
                               Selects   a  specific  program  from  within  a
                               multi-program transport stream. Note that  Quad
                               4K is not currently supported.

                            Rotate -> (string)
                               Use  Rotate  (InputRotate)  to  specify how the
                               service rotates  your  video.  You  can  choose
                               automatic  rotation  or specify a rotation. You
                               can specify a clockwise rotation of 0, 90, 180,
                               or  270  degrees. If your input video container
                               is .mov or .mp4 and  your  input  has  rotation
                               metadata,  you can choose Automatic to have the
                               service rotate  your  video  according  to  the
                               rotation  specified  in the metadata. The rota-
                               tion must be within one degree of 90,  180,  or
                               270 degrees. If the rotation metadata specifies
                               any other rotation, the service will default to
                               no  rotation.  By  default, the service does no
                               rotation, even if your input video has rotation
                               metadata.  The  service  doesn't  pass  through
                               rotation metadata.

                            SampleRange -> (string)
                               If the sample  range  metadata  in  your  input
                               video  is  accurate, or if you don't know about
                               sample range, keep the  default  value,  Follow
                               (FOLLOW),  for  this  setting. When you do, the
                               service automatically detects your input sample
                               range.  If  your input video has metadata indi-
                               cating the  wrong  sample  range,  specify  the
                               accurate sample range here. When you do, Media-
                               Convert ignores any sample range information in
                               the input metadata. Regardless of whether Medi-
                               aConvert uses the input  sample  range  or  the
                               sample  range  that  you  specify, MediaConvert
                               uses the sample range for transcoding and  also
                               writes it to the output metadata.

                 KantarWatermark -> (structure)
                     Use these settings only when you use Kantar watermarking.
                     Specify the values that MediaConvert uses to generate and
                     place  Kantar watermarks in your output audio. These set-
                     tings apply to every output in your job. In  addition  to
                     specifying these values, you also need to store your Kan-
                     tar credentials in AWS Secrets Manager. For more informa-
                     tion,                                                 see

                     ChannelName -> (string)
                        Provide  an  audio channel name from your Kantar audio
                        license.

                     ContentReference -> (string)
                        Specify a unique identifier for Kantar to use for this
                        piece of content.

                     CredentialsSecretName -> (string)
                        Provide  the  name  of  the AWS Secrets Manager secret
                        where your Kantar credentials are  stored.  Note  that
                        your  MediaConvert service role must provide access to
                        this    secret.    For    more    information,     see

                     FileOffset -> (double)
                        Optional. Specify an offset, in  whole  seconds,  from
                        the  start  of  your  output  and the beginning of the
                        watermarking. When you don't specify an offset, Kantar
                        defaults to zero.

                     KantarLicenseId -> (integer)
                        Provide  your Kantar license ID number. You should get
                        this number from Kantar.

                     KantarServerUrl -> (string)
                        Provide the HTTPS endpoint to the Kantar  server.  You
                        should get this endpoint from Kantar.

                     LogDestination -> (string)
                        Optional.  Specify the Amazon S3 bucket where you want
                        MediaConvert to store your Kantar watermark XML  logs.
                        When  you don't specify a bucket, MediaConvert doesn't
                        save these logs. Note that your  MediaConvert  service
                        role  must  provide  access to this location. For more
                        information,                                       see

                     Metadata3 -> (string)
                        You can optionally use this field to specify the first
                        timestamp that Kantar embeds during watermarking. Kan-
                        tar suggests that you be very cautious when using this
                        Kantar  feature,  and that you use it only on channels
                        that are managed specifically for use with  this  fea-
                        ture  by  your Audience Measurement Operator. For more
                        information about this feature, contact Kantar techni-
                        cal support.

                     Metadata4 -> (string)
                        Additional metadata that MediaConvert sends to Kantar.
                        Maximum length is 50 characters.

                     Metadata5 -> (string)
                        Additional metadata that MediaConvert sends to Kantar.
                        Maximum length is 50 characters.

                     Metadata6 -> (string)
                        Additional metadata that MediaConvert sends to Kantar.
                        Maximum length is 50 characters.

                     Metadata7 -> (string)
                        Additional metadata that MediaConvert sends to Kantar.
                        Maximum length is 50 characters.

                     Metadata8 -> (string)
                        Additional metadata that MediaConvert sends to Kantar.
                        Maximum length is 50 characters.

                 MotionImageInserter -> (structure)
                     Overlay motion graphics on top of your video. The  motion
                     graphics  that  you specify here appear on all outputs in
                     all   output   groups.   For   more   information,    see
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/motion-graphic-overlay.html.

                     Framerate -> (structure)
                        If your motion graphic asset is a .mov file, keep this
                        setting unspecified. If your motion graphic asset is a
                        series of .png files, specify the frame  rate  of  the
                        overlay in frames per second, as a fraction. For exam-
                        ple, specify 24 fps as 24/1. Make sure that the number
                        of  images  in  your series matches the frame rate and
                        your intended overlay duration. For  example,  if  you
                        want  a  30-second  overlay at 30 fps, you should have
                        900 .png images. This overlay frame rate doesn't  need
                        to match the frame rate of the underlying video.

                        FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                            The  bottom  of  the  fraction that expresses your
                            overlay frame rate. For  example,  if  your  frame
                            rate is 24 fps, set this value to 1.

                        FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                            The  top of the fraction that expresses your over-
                            lay frame rate. For example, if your frame rate is
                            24 fps, set this value to 24.

                     Input -> (string)
                        Specify the .mov file or series of .png files that you
                        want to overlay on your video. For .png files, provide
                        the  file  name  of the first file in the series. Make
                        sure that the names of the .png files end with sequen-
                        tial  numbers  that  specify  the  order that they are
                        played  in.  For   example,   overlay_000.png,   over-
                        lay_001.png,  overlay_002.png, and so on. The sequence
                        must start at zero, and each image file name must have
                        the same number of digits. Pad your initial file names
                        with enough zeros to complete the sequence. For  exam-
                        ple, if the first image is overlay_0.png, there can be
                        only 10 images in the sequence, with  the  last  image
                        being  overlay_9.png.  But if the first image is over-
                        lay_00.png, there can be 100 images in the sequence.

                     InsertionMode -> (string)
                        Choose the type of motion graphic asset that  you  are
                        providing  for  your  overlay. You can choose either a
                        .mov file or a series of .png files.

                     Offset -> (structure)
                        Use Offset to specify the  placement  of  your  motion
                        graphic overlay on the video frame. Specify in pixels,
                        from the upper-left corner of the frame. If you  don't
                        specify  an offset, the service scales your overlay to
                        the full size of the  frame.  Otherwise,  the  service
                        inserts  the  overlay  at  its  native  resolution and
                        scales the size up or down with any video scaling.

                        ImageX -> (integer)
                            Set the distance, in pixels, between  the  overlay
                            and the left edge of the video frame.

                        ImageY -> (integer)
                            Set  the  distance, in pixels, between the overlay
                            and the top edge of the video frame.

                     Playback -> (string)
                        Specify whether your motion graphic overlay repeats on
                        a loop or plays only once.

                     StartTime -> (string)
                        Specify  when  the motion overlay begins. Use timecode
                        format (HH:MM:SS:FF or HH:MM:SS;FF).  Make  sure  that
                        the  timecode  you provide here takes into account how
                        you have set up your timecode configuration under both
                        job  settings  and input settings. The simplest way to
                        do that is to set both to start at 0. If you  need  to
                        set  up  your job to follow timecodes embedded in your
                        source that don't start at zero, make  sure  that  you
                        specify  a start time that is after the first embedded
                        timecode.     For      more      information,      see

                 NielsenConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Settings  for your Nielsen configuration. If you don't do
                     Nielsen measurement and analytics, ignore these settings.
                     When  you enable Nielsen configuration (nielsenConfigura-
                     tion), MediaConvert enables PCM to ID3  tagging  for  all
                     outputs  in the job. To enable Nielsen configuration pro-
                     grammatically, include an instance  of  nielsenConfigura-
                     tion  in  your  JSON job specification. Even if you don't
                     include any children of nielsenConfiguration,  you  still
                     enable the setting.

                     BreakoutCode -> (integer)
                        Nielsen  has  discontinued  the  use  of breakout code
                        functionality. If you must include this property,  set
                        the value to zero.

                     DistributorId -> (string)
                        Use Distributor ID (DistributorID) to specify the dis-
                        tributor ID that is assigned to your  organization  by
                        Neilsen.

                 NielsenNonLinearWatermark -> (structure)
                     Ignore  these  settings  unless  you  are  using  Nielsen
                     non-linear watermarking. Specify the values  that  Media-
                     Convert  uses to generate and place Nielsen watermarks in
                     your output audio. In addition to specifying  these  val-
                     ues, you also need to set up your cloud TIC server. These
                     settings apply to every output in your job. The MediaCon-
                     vert  implementation  is  currently  with  the  following
                     Nielsen versions: Nielsen  Watermark  SDK  Version  5.2.1
                     Nielsen NLM Watermark Engine Version 1.2.7 Nielsen Water-
                     mark Authenticator [SID_TIC] Version [5.0.0]

                     ActiveWatermarkProcess -> (string)
                        Choose the type of Nielsen watermarks that you want in
                        your   outputs.   When   you  choose  NAES  2  and  NW
                        (NAES2_AND_NW), you must provide a value for the  set-
                        ting  SID (sourceId). When you choose CBET (CBET), you
                        must provide a value for the setting  CSID  (cbetSour-
                        ceId).   When   you   choose  NAES  2,  NW,  and  CBET
                        (NAES2_AND_NW_AND_CBET), you must provide  values  for
                        both of these settings.

                     AdiFilename -> (string)
                        Optional.  Use  this setting when you want the service
                        to include an ADI file in the  Nielsen  metadata  .zip
                        file.  To  provide  an ADI file, store it in Amazon S3
                        and provide a URL to it here. The URL should be in the
                        following  format: S3://bucket/path/ADI-file. For more
                        information about the metadata .zip file, see the set-
                        ting Metadata destination (metadataDestination).

                     AssetId -> (string)
                        Use  the  asset  ID  that  you  provide  to Nielsen to
                        uniquely identify this asset. Required for all Nielsen
                        non-linear watermarking.

                     AssetName -> (string)
                        Use  the  asset  name  that you provide to Nielsen for
                        this asset. Required for all Nielsen non-linear water-
                        marking.

                     CbetSourceId -> (string)
                        Use  the  CSID that Nielsen provides to you. This CBET
                        source ID should be unique to your Nielsen account but
                        common  to  all  of  your output assets that have CBET
                        watermarking. Required when you choose a value for the
                        setting  Watermark types (ActiveWatermarkProcess) that
                        includes CBET.

                     EpisodeId -> (string)
                        Optional. If  this  asset  uses  an  episode  ID  with
                        Nielsen, provide it here.

                     MetadataDestination -> (string)
                        Specify  the  Amazon S3 location where you want Media-
                        Convert to save your Nielsen non-linear metadata  .zip
                        file. This Amazon S3 bucket must be in the same Region
                        as the one where you do your MediaConvert transcoding.
                        If  you want to include an ADI file in this .zip file,
                        use the setting ADI file (adiFilename) to specify  it.
                        MediaConvert  delivers the Nielsen metadata .zip files
                        only to your metadata destination Amazon S3 bucket. It
                        doesn't  deliver  the  .zip  files to Nielsen. You are
                        responsible for delivering the metadata .zip files  to
                        Nielsen.

                     SourceId -> (integer)
                        Use  the SID that Nielsen provides to you. This source
                        ID should be unique to your Nielsen account but common
                        to all of your output assets. Required for all Nielsen
                        non-linear watermarking. This ID should be  unique  to
                        your  Nielsen account but common to all of your output
                        assets. Required for all Nielsen non-linear watermark-
                        ing.

                     SourceWatermarkStatus -> (string)
                        Required.  Specify whether your source content already
                        contains Nielsen non-linear watermarks. When  you  set
                        this  value  to Watermarked (WATERMARKED), the service
                        fails the job. Nielsen requires that you add  non-lin-
                        ear  watermarking  to  only clean content that doesn't
                        already have non-linear Nielsen watermarks.

                     TicServerUrl -> (string)
                        Specify the endpoint for the TIC server that you  have
                        deployed and configured in the AWS Cloud. Required for
                        all  Nielsen  non-linear  watermarking.   MediaConvert
                        can't  connect  directly to a TIC server. Instead, you
                        must use API Gateway to provide  a  RESTful  interface
                        between  MediaConvert and a TIC server that you deploy
                        in your AWS account. For more information on deploying
                        a  TIC server in your AWS account and the required API
                        Gateway, contact Nielsen support.

                     UniqueTicPerAudioTrack -> (string)
                        To create assets that have the same TIC values in each
                        audio   track,  keep  the  default  value  Share  TICs
                        (SAME_TICS_PER_TRACK).  To  create  assets  that  have
                        unique  TIC  values  for  each audio track, choose Use
                        unique TICs (RESERVE_UNIQUE_TICS_PER_TRACK).

                 OutputGroups -> (list)
                     (OutputGroups) contains one group of  settings  for  each
                     set  of  outputs  that  share  a common package type. All
                     unpackaged files (MPEG-4, MPEG-2 TS, Quicktime, MXF,  and
                     no  container)  are  grouped  in a single output group as
                     well. Required in (OutputGroups) is a group  of  settings
                     that  apply  to  the  whole  group.  This required object
                     depends on the value you set for  (Type)  under  (Output-
                     Groups)>(OutputGroupSettings).   Type,   settings  object
                     pairs  are  as  follows.  *  FILE_GROUP_SETTINGS,   File-
                     GroupSettings  *  HLS_GROUP_SETTINGS,  HlsGroupSettings *
                     DASH_ISO_GROUP_SETTINGS,      DashIsoGroupSettings      *
                     MS_SMOOTH_GROUP_SETTINGS,     MsSmoothGroupSettings     *
                     CMAF_GROUP_SETTINGS, CmafGroupSettings

                     (structure)
                        Group of outputs

                        AutomatedEncodingSettings -> (structure)
                            Use automated encoding to have MediaConvert choose
                            your  encoding  settings for you, based on charac-
                            teristics of your input video.

                            AbrSettings -> (structure)
                               Use automated ABR to have MediaConvert  set  up
                               the  renditions  in  your  ABR  package for you
                               automatically, based on characteristics of your
                               input video. This feature optimizes video qual-
                               ity while minimizing the overall size  of  your
                               ABR package.

                               MaxAbrBitrate -> (integer)
                                   Optional.  The maximum target bit rate used
                                   in your automated ABR stack. Use this value
                                   to set an upper limit on the bandwidth con-
                                   sumed  by  the  highest-quality  rendition.
                                   This  is the rendition that is delivered to
                                   viewers with the fastest  internet  connec-
                                   tions. If you don't specify a value, Media-
                                   Convert uses 8,000,000 (8 mb/s) by default.

                               MaxRenditions -> (integer)
                                   Optional.  The maximum number of renditions
                                   that MediaConvert will create in your auto-
                                   mated  ABR  stack. The number of renditions
                                   is determined automatically, based on anal-
                                   ysis  of  each  job,  but will never exceed
                                   this limit. When you set this  to  Auto  in
                                   the console, which is equivalent to exclud-
                                   ing it from your  JSON  job  specification,
                                   MediaConvert defaults to a limit of 15.

                               MinAbrBitrate -> (integer)
                                   Optional.  The  minimum target bitrate used
                                   in your automated ABR stack. Use this value
                                   to  set  a  lower  limit  on the bitrate of
                                   video delivered to viewers with slow inter-
                                   net  connections.  If  you  don't specify a
                                   value, MediaConvert uses 600,000 (600 kb/s)
                                   by default.

                        CustomName -> (string)
                            Use  Custom  Group  Name (CustomName) to specify a
                            name for the output group. This value is displayed
                            on the console and can make your job settings JSON
                            more human-readable. It does not affect your  out-
                            puts.  Use up to twelve characters that are either
                            letters, numbers, spaces, or underscores.

                        Name -> (string)
                            Name of the output group

                        OutputGroupSettings -> (structure)
                            Output Group settings, including type

                            CmafGroupSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings related to your CMAF  output  package.

                               AdditionalManifests -> (list)
                                   By  default,  the   service   creates   one
                                   top-level  .m3u8  HLS  manifest and one top
                                   -level .mpd DASH  manifest  for  each  CMAF
                                   output  group  in  your  job. These default
                                   manifests reference  every  output  in  the
                                   output    group.   To   create   additional
                                   top-level manifests that reference a subset
                                   of the outputs in the output group, specify
                                   a list of them here.  For  each  additional
                                   manifest that you specify, the service cre-
                                   ates one HLS manifest and  one  DASH  mani-
                                   fest.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specify the details for each pair of HLS
                                      and DASH additional manifests  that  you
                                      want  the  service  to generate for this
                                      CMAF output group. Each  pair  of  mani-
                                      fests  can  reference a different subset
                                      of outputs in the group.

                                      ManifestNameModifier -> (string)
                                          Specify a  name  modifier  that  the
                                          service  adds  to  the  name of this
                                          manifest to make it  different  from
                                          the  file  names  of  the other main
                                          manifests in the output  group.  For
                                          example,  say  that the default main
                                          manifest  for  your  HLS  group   is
                                          film-name.m3u8.    If    you   enter
                                          "-no-premium" for this setting, then
                                          the  file name the service generates
                                          for  this  top-level   manifest   is
                                          film-name-no-premium.m3u8.  For  HLS
                                          output groups, specify  a  manifest-
                                          NameModifier  that is different from
                                          the nameModifier of the output.  The
                                          service  uses  the output name modi-
                                          fier to create unique names for  the
                                          individual variant manifests.

                                      SelectedOutputs -> (list)
                                          Specify  the  outputs  that you want
                                          this additional  top-level  manifest
                                          to reference.

                               BaseUrl -> (string)
                                   A  partial  URI  prefix that will be put in
                                   the manifest file at the top level  BaseURL
                                   element.  Can be used if streams are deliv-

                               ClientCache -> (string)
                                   Disable  this  setting only when your work-
                                   flow  requires  the   #EXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:no

                                   Enabled (ENABLED) and  control  caching  in
                                   your  video  distribution set up. For exam-
                                   ple, use the Cache-Control http header.

                               CodecSpecification -> (string)
                                   Specification  to  use  (RFC-6381  or   the
                                   default RFC-4281) during m3u8 playlist gen-

                               Destination -> (string)
                                   Use Destination  (Destination)  to  specify
                                   the S3 output location and the output file-
                                   name base. Destination accepts format iden-
                                   tifiers.  If  you  do  not specify the base
                                   filename in the URI, the service  will  use
                                   the filename of the input file. If your job
                                   has multiple inputs, the service  uses  the
                                   filename of the first input file.

                               DestinationSettings -> (structure)
                                   Settings  associated  with the destination.
                                   Will vary based on the type of destination

                                          EncryptionType -> (string)
                                             Specify how you  want  your  data
                                             keys  managed. AWS uses data keys
                                             to encrypt your content. AWS also
                                             encrypts   the  data  keys  them-
                                             selves, using a  customer  master
                                             key  (CMK),  and  then stores the

                                             your  encrypted content. Use this
                                             setting to specify which AWS ser-

                                             you want your master  key  to  be
                                             managed  by  AWS  Key  Management
                                             Service  (KMS),  choose  AWS  KMS
                                             (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).  By
                                             default, when you choose AWS KMS,
                                             KMS uses the AWS managed customer
                                             master key (CMK) associated  with
                                             Amazon  S3  to  encrypt your data

                                             managed CMK. Do so by  specifying
                                             the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
                                             the key for the setting  KMS  ARN

                                             alongside  your  KMS key. AWS KMS
                                             uses this encryption  context  as
                                             additional   authenticated   data

                                      want  the service to use when encrypting
                                      your CMAF segments. Choose AES-CBC  sub-
                                      sample     (SAMPLE-AES)    or    AES_CTR
                                      (AES-CTR).

                                   InitializationVectorInManifest -> (string)
                                      When you  use  DRM  with  CMAF  outputs,
                                      choose  whether  the  service writes the
                                      128-bit encryption initialization vector
                                      in the HLS and DASH manifests.

                                   SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)
                                      If  your  output group type is CMAF, use
                                      these settings when doing DRM encryption
                                      with  a SPEKE-compliant key provider. If
                                      your output group type is HLS, DASH,  or
                                      Microsoft      Smooth,      use      the

                               ImageBasedTrickPlay -> (string)
                                   Specify  whether   MediaConvert   generates
                                   images  for  trick  play.  Keep the default
                                   value, None (NONE),  to  not  generate  any
                                   images.  Choose  Thumbnail  (THUMBNAIL)  to
                                   generate tiled thumbnails. Choose Thumbnail
                                   and full frame (THUMBNAIL_AND_FULLFRAME) to

                                   tion  images  of  single  frames.  When you
                                   enable Write  HLS  manifest  (WriteHlsMani-
                                   fest),  MediaConvert  creates a child mani-
                                   fest for each set of images that you gener-
                                   ate  and  adds corresponding entries to the
                                   parent manifest. When you enable Write DASH
                                   manifest  (WriteDashManifest), MediaConvert
                                   adds an entry in the .mpd manifest for each
                                   set  of  images that you generate. A common
                                   application for these images is Roku  trick

                                   IntervalCadence -> (string)
                                      The  cadence  MediaConvert  follows  for
                                      generating thumbnails. If  set  to  FOL-
                                      LOW_IFRAME,    MediaConvert    generates
                                      thumbnails for each  IDR  frame  in  the
                                      output  (matching  the  GOP cadence). If
                                      set to FOLLOW_CUSTOM, MediaConvert  gen-
                                      erates   thumbnails   according  to  the
                                      interval you specify in  thumbnailInter-
                                      val.

                                   ThumbnailHeight -> (integer)
                                      Height  of  each  thumbnail  within each
                                      tile image, in pixels.  Leave  blank  to
                                      maintain  aspect  ratio  with  thumbnail
                                      width. If  following  the  aspect  ratio
                                      would   lead  to  a  total  tile  height
                                      greater than 4096, then the job will  be
                                      rejected. Must be divisible by 2.

                                   ThumbnailInterval -> (double)
                                      Enter  the  interval,  in  seconds, that
                                      MediaConvert  uses  to  generate  thumb-
                                      nails. If the interval you enter doesn't
                                      align with the output frame rate, Media-
                                      Convert  automatically rounds the inter-
                                      val to align with the output frame rate.
                                      For example, if the output frame rate is
                                      29.97 frames per second and you enter 5,
                                      MediaConvert  uses  a 150 frame interval
                                      to generate thumbnails.

                                   ThumbnailWidth -> (integer)
                                      Width of each thumbnail within each tile
                                      image,  in  pixels. Default is 312. Must
                                      be divisible by 8.

                                   TileHeight -> (integer)
                                      Number of thumbnails in each column of a
                                      tile  image.  Set  a value between 2 and
                                      2048. Must be divisible by 2.

                                   TileWidth -> (integer)
                                      Number of thumbnails in each  row  of  a
                                      tile  image.  Set  a value between 1 and
                                      512.

                               ManifestCompression -> (string)
                                   When set to GZIP, compresses HLS  playlist.

                               ManifestDurationFormat -> (string)
                                   Indicates   whether   the  output  manifest
                                   should use floating point values  for  seg-
                                   ment duration.

                               MinBufferTime -> (integer)

                               MinFinalSegmentLength -> (double)
                                   Keep this setting at the default  value  of
                                   0, unless you are troubleshooting a problem
                                   with how devices play back the end of  your
                                   video   asset.  If  you  know  that  player
                                   devices are hanging on the final segment of
                                   your video because the length of your final
                                   segment is too short, use this  setting  to
                                   specify  a minimum final segment length, in
                                   seconds. Choose a  value  that  is  greater
                                   than  or equal to 1 and less than your seg-
                                   ment length. When you specify a  value  for
                                   this  setting, the encoder will combine any
                                   final segment  that  is  shorter  than  the
                                   length  that  you specify with the previous
                                   segment. For example, your  segment  length
                                   is  3  seconds and your final segment is .5
                                   seconds without  a  minimum  final  segment
                                   length; when you set the minimum final seg-
                                   ment length to 1, your final segment is 3.5
                                   seconds.

                               MpdProfile -> (string)
                                   Specify   whether   your  DASH  profile  is
                                   on-demand or main.  When  you  choose  Main
                                   profile (MAIN_PROFILE), the service signals
                                   urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-main:2011    in
                                   your  .mpd  DASH  manifest. When you choose
                                   On-demand (ON_DEMAND_PROFILE), the  service
                                   signals
                                   urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-on-demand:2011
                                   in  your  .mpd.  When you choose On-demand,
                                   you must also set the output group  setting
                                   Segment  control (SegmentControl) to Single
                                   file (SINGLE_FILE).

                               PtsOffsetHandlingForBFrames -> (string)
                                   Use this  setting  only  when  your  output
                                   video stream has B-frames, which causes the
                                   initial presentation time stamp (PTS) to be
                                   offset  from  the initial decode time stamp
                                   (DTS). Specify how MediaConvert handles PTS
                                   when  writing  time  stamps  in output DASH
                                   manifests.   Choose   Match   initial   PTS
                                   (MATCH_INITIAL_PTS) when you want MediaCon-
                                   vert to use the initial PTS  as  the  first
                                   time   stamp   in   the   manifest.  Choose
                                   Zero-based (ZERO_BASED) to  have  MediaCon-
                                   vert  ignore  the  initial PTS in the video
                                   stream and instead write the  initial  time
                                   stamp  as zero in the manifest. For outputs
                                   that don't have B-frames, the  time  stamps
                                   in   your  DASH  manifests  start  at  zero
                                   regardless of your choice here.

                               SegmentControl -> (string)
                                   When set to SINGLE_FILE,  a  single  output
                                   file is generated, which is internally seg-
                                   mented using the Fragment Length  and  Seg-
                                   ment  Length.  When set to SEGMENTED_FILES,
                                   separate segment files will be created.

                               SegmentLength -> (integer)
                                   Specify the length, in  whole  seconds,  of
                                   each  segment.  When  you  don't  specify a
                                   value, MediaConvert defaults to 10. Related
                                   settings:  Use Segment length control (Seg-
                                   mentLengthControl) to specify  whether  the
                                   encoder  enforces  this value strictly. Use
                                   Segment  control  (CmafSegmentControl)   to
                                   specify  whether MediaConvert creates sepa-
                                   rate segment files or one content file that
                                   has  metadata  to  mark  the segment bound-
                                   aries.

                               SegmentLengthControl -> (string)
                                   Specify how you want MediaConvert to deter-
                                   mine   the  segment  length.  Choose  Exact
                                   (EXACT) to have the encoder use  the  exact
                                   length  that  you  specify with the setting
                                   Segment length (SegmentLength). This  might
                                   result  in  extra I-frames. Choose Multiple
                                   of GOP (GOP_MULTIPLE) to have  the  encoder
                                   round  up  the segment lengths to match the
                                   next GOP boundary.

                               StreamInfResolution -> (string)
                                   Include or exclude RESOLUTION attribute for
                                   video  in  EXT-X-STREAM-INF  tag of variant
                                   manifest.

                               TargetDurationCompatibilityMode -> (string)
                                   When set  to  LEGACY,  the  segment  target
                                   duration  is always rounded up to the near-
                                   est integer value above its  current  value
                                   in  seconds.  When  set to SPEC\_COMPLIANT,
                                   the segment target duration is  rounded  up
                                   to  the  nearest  integer value if fraction
                                   seconds are greater than or  equal  to  0.5
                                   (>=  0.5) and rounded down if less than 0.5
                                   (<0.5). You may need to use LEGACY if  your
                                   client  needs  to  ensure  that  the target
                                   duration is always longer than  the  actual
                                   duration of the segment. Some older players
                                   may experience  interrupted  playback  when
                                   the actual duration of a track in a segment
                                   is longer than the target duration.

                               WriteDashManifest -> (string)
                                   When set to ENABLED, a  DASH  MPD  manifest
                                   will be generated for this output.

                                   When you enable Precise segment duration in
                                   DASH manifests  (writeSegmentTimelineInRep-
                                   resentation), your DASH manifest shows pre-

                                   By default, the service  creates  one  .mpd
                                   DASH  manifest  for  each  DASH  ISO output
                                   group in your job.  This  default  manifest
                                   references   every  output  in  the  output
                                   group. To create additional DASH  manifests
                                   that  reference  a subset of the outputs in
                                   the output group, specify a  list  of  them
                                   here.

                                      Specify  the details for each additional
                                      DASH manifest that you want the  service
                                      to  generate for this output group. Each
                                      manifest can reference a different  sub-
                                      set of outputs in the group.

                                      ManifestNameModifier -> (string)
                                          Specify  a  name  modifier  that the
                                          service adds to  the  name  of  this
                                          manifest  to  make it different from
                                          the file names  of  the  other  main
                                          manifests  in  the output group. For
                                          example, say that the  default  main
                                          manifest  for  your  DASH  group  is
                                          film-name.mpd.    If    you    enter
                                          "-no-premium" for this setting, then
                                          the file name the service  generates
                                          for   this   top-level  manifest  is
                                          film-name-no-premium.mpd.

                               AudioChannelConfigSchemeIdUri -> (string)
                                   Use this setting only when your audio codec
                                   is  a  Dolby  one (AC3, EAC3, or Atmos) and
                                   your downstream workflow requires that your
                                   DASH manifest use the Dolby channel config-
                                   uration tag, rather than the MPEG one.  For
                                   example, you might need to use this to make
                                   dynamic ad insertion  work.  Specify  which

                               BaseUrl -> (string)
                                   A  partial  URI  prefix that will be put in
                                   the manifest (.mpd) file at the  top  level
                                   BaseURL element. Can be used if streams are
                                   delivered from a  different  URL  than  the

                                   Use  Destination  (Destination)  to specify
                                   the S3 output location and the output file-
                                   name base. Destination accepts format iden-
                                   tifiers. If you do  not  specify  the  base
                                   filename  in  the URI, the service will use
                                   the filename of the input file. If your job
                                   has  multiple  inputs, the service uses the

                                             Specify  how  you  want your data
                                             keys managed. AWS uses data  keys
                                             to encrypt your content. AWS also
                                             encrypts  the  data  keys   them-
                                             selves,  using  a customer master

                                             your encrypted content. Use  this
                                             setting to specify which AWS ser-

                                             managed  by  AWS  Key  Management
                                             Service  (KMS),  choose  AWS  KMS
                                             (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).  By
                                             default, when you choose AWS KMS,
                                             KMS uses the AWS managed customer
                                             master  key (CMK) associated with
                                             Amazon S3 to  encrypt  your  data

                                             managed  CMK. Do so by specifying
                                             the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
                                             the  key  for the setting KMS ARN
                                             (kmsKeyArn).

                                          KmsEncryptionContext -> (string)
                                             Optionally, specify  the  encryp-
                                             tion context that you want to use
                                             alongside your KMS key.  AWS  KMS
                                             uses  this  encryption context as
                                             additional   authenticated   data
                                             (AAD)  to  support  authenticated

                                             use  to encrypt the data key that
                                             AWS uses to encrypt  your  output
                                             content.    Enter    the   Amazon

                                             To  use  this  setting,  you must
                                             also set  Server-side  encryption

                                      on  older  devices.  Otherwise, keep the
                                      default setting CENC  v1  (CENC_V1).  If
                                      you  choose  Unencrypted  SEI,  for that
                                      output, the  service  will  exclude  the

                                      or  Microsoft Smooth, use these settings
                                      when  doing  DRM   encryption   with   a
                                      SPEKE-compliant  key  provider.  If your

                                   IntervalCadence -> (string)
                                      The  cadence  MediaConvert  follows  for
                                      generating  thumbnails.  If  set to FOL-
                                      LOW_IFRAME,    MediaConvert    generates
                                      thumbnails  for  each  IDR  frame in the
                                      output (matching the  GOP  cadence).  If
                                      set  to FOLLOW_CUSTOM, MediaConvert gen-
                                      erates  thumbnails  according   to   the
                                      interval  you specify in thumbnailInter-
                                      val.

                                   ThumbnailHeight -> (integer)
                                      Height of  each  thumbnail  within  each
                                      tile  image,  in  pixels. Leave blank to
                                      maintain  aspect  ratio  with  thumbnail
                                      width.  If  following  the  aspect ratio
                                      would  lead  to  a  total  tile   height
                                      greater  than 4096, then the job will be
                                      rejected. Must be divisible by 2.

                                   ThumbnailInterval -> (double)
                                      Enter the  interval,  in  seconds,  that
                                      MediaConvert  uses  to  generate  thumb-
                                      nails. If the interval you enter doesn't
                                      align with the output frame rate, Media-
                                      Convert automatically rounds the  inter-
                                      val to align with the output frame rate.
                                      For example, if the output frame rate is
                                      29.97 frames per second and you enter 5,
                                      MediaConvert uses a 150  frame  interval
                                      to generate thumbnails.

                                   ThumbnailWidth -> (integer)
                                      Width of each thumbnail within each tile
                                      image, in pixels. Default is  312.  Must
                                      be divisible by 8.

                                   TileHeight -> (integer)
                                      Number of thumbnails in each column of a
                                      tile image. Set a value  between  2  and
                                      2048. Must be divisible by 2.

                                   TileWidth -> (integer)
                                      Number  of  thumbnails  in each row of a
                                      tile image. Set a value  between  1  and
                                      512.

                               MinBufferTime -> (integer)
                                   Minimum  time  of  initially buffered media
                                   that is needed to ensure smooth playout.

                               MinFinalSegmentLength -> (double)
                                   Keep this setting at the default  value  of
                                   0, unless you are troubleshooting a problem
                                   with how devices play back the end of  your
                                   video   asset.  If  you  know  that  player
                                   devices are hanging on the final segment of
                                   your video because the length of your final
                                   segment is too short, use this  setting  to
                                   specify  a minimum final segment length, in
                                   seconds. Choose a  value  that  is  greater
                                   than  or equal to 1 and less than your seg-
                                   ment length. When you specify a  value  for
                                   this  setting, the encoder will combine any
                                   final segment  that  is  shorter  than  the
                                   length  that  you specify with the previous
                                   segment. For example, your  segment  length
                                   is  3  seconds and your final segment is .5
                                   seconds without  a  minimum  final  segment
                                   length; when you set the minimum final seg-
                                   ment length to 1, your final segment is 3.5
                                   seconds.

                               MpdProfile -> (string)
                                   Specify   whether   your  DASH  profile  is
                                   on-demand or main.  When  you  choose  Main
                                   profile (MAIN_PROFILE), the service signals
                                   urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-main:2011    in
                                   your  .mpd  DASH  manifest. When you choose
                                   On-demand (ON_DEMAND_PROFILE), the  service
                                   signals
                                   urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-on-demand:2011
                                   in  your  .mpd.  When you choose On-demand,
                                   you must also set the output group  setting
                                   Segment  control (SegmentControl) to Single
                                   file (SINGLE_FILE).

                               PtsOffsetHandlingForBFrames -> (string)
                                   Use this  setting  only  when  your  output
                                   video stream has B-frames, which causes the
                                   initial presentation time stamp (PTS) to be
                                   offset  from  the initial decode time stamp
                                   (DTS). Specify how MediaConvert handles PTS
                                   when  writing  time  stamps  in output DASH
                                   manifests.   Choose   Match   initial   PTS
                                   (MATCH_INITIAL_PTS) when you want MediaCon-
                                   vert to use the initial PTS  as  the  first
                                   time   stamp   in   the   manifest.  Choose
                                   Zero-based (ZERO_BASED) to  have  MediaCon-
                                   vert  ignore  the  initial PTS in the video
                                   stream and instead write the  initial  time
                                   stamp  as zero in the manifest. For outputs
                                   that don't have B-frames, the  time  stamps
                                   in   your  DASH  manifests  start  at  zero
                                   regardless of your choice here.

                               SegmentControl -> (string)
                                   When set to SINGLE_FILE,  a  single  output
                                   file is generated, which is internally seg-
                                   mented using the Fragment Length  and  Seg-
                                   ment  Length.  When set to SEGMENTED_FILES,
                                   separate segment files will be created.

                               SegmentLength -> (integer)
                                   Specify the length, in  whole  seconds,  of
                                   each  segment.  When  you  don't  specify a
                                   value, MediaConvert defaults to 30. Related
                                   settings:  Use Segment length control (Seg-
                                   mentLengthControl) to specify  whether  the
                                   encoder  enforces  this value strictly. Use
                                   Segment control (DashIsoSegmentControl)  to
                                   specify  whether MediaConvert creates sepa-
                                   rate segment files or one content file that
                                   has  metadata  to  mark  the segment bound-
                                   aries.

                               SegmentLengthControl -> (string)
                                   Specify how you want MediaConvert to deter-
                                   mine   the  segment  length.  Choose  Exact
                                   (EXACT) to have the encoder use  the  exact
                                   length  that  you  specify with the setting
                                   Segment length (SegmentLength). This  might
                                   result  in  extra I-frames. Choose Multiple
                                   of GOP (GOP_MULTIPLE) to have  the  encoder
                                   round  up  the segment lengths to match the
                                   next GOP boundary.

                               WriteSegmentTimelineInRepresentation         ->
                               (string)
                                   If  you  get an HTTP error in the 400 range
                                   when you play back your DASH output, enable
                                   this  setting  and run your transcoding job
                                   again. When you enable  this  setting,  the
                                   service writes precise segment durations in
                                   the DASH  manifest.  The  segment  duration
                                   information appears inside the SegmentTime-
                                   line element, inside SegmentTemplate at the
                                   Representation level. When you don't enable
                                   this setting, the service  writes  approxi-

                               Settings related to  your  File  output  group.
                               MediaConvert  uses  this  group  of settings to
                               generate a single standalone file, rather  than
                               a  streaming package. When you work directly in
                               your  JSON  job  specification,  include   this
                               object  and  any required children when you set
                               Type,     under     OutputGroupSettings,     to

                                   name base. Destination accepts format iden-
                                   tifiers. If you do  not  specify  the  base
                                   filename  in  the URI, the service will use
                                   the filename of the input file. If your job
                                   has  multiple  inputs, the service uses the
                                   filename of the first input file.

                                          EncryptionType -> (string)
                                             Specify  how  you  want your data
                                             keys managed. AWS uses data  keys
                                             to encrypt your content. AWS also
                                             encrypts  the  data  keys   them-
                                             selves,  using  a customer master
                                             key (CMK), and  then  stores  the
                                             encrypted   data  keys  alongside
                                             your encrypted content. Use  this
                                             setting to specify which AWS ser-
                                             vice manages the  CMK.  For  sim-
                                             plest  set  up,  choose Amazon S3

                                             you  want  your  master key to be
                                             managed  by  AWS  Key  Management
                                             Service  (KMS),  choose  AWS  KMS
                                             (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).  By
                                             default, when you choose AWS KMS,
                                             KMS uses the AWS managed customer
                                             master  key (CMK) associated with
                                             Amazon S3 to  encrypt  your  data
                                             keys.  You  can optionally choose
                                             to specify a different,  customer
                                             managed  CMK. Do so by specifying
                                             the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
                                             the  key  for the setting KMS ARN
                                             (kmsKeyArn).

                                          KmsEncryptionContext -> (string)
                                             Optionally, specify  the  encryp-

                                             alongside your KMS key.  AWS  KMS
                                             uses  this  encryption context as
                                             additional   authenticated   data
                                             (AAD)  to  support  authenticated

                                             Optionally,  specify the customer
                                             master key (CMK) that you want to
                                             use  to encrypt the data key that
                                             AWS uses to encrypt  your  output
                                             content.    Enter    the   Amazon

                                             To  use  this  setting,  you must
                                             also set  Server-side  encryption

                               AdMarkers -> (list)
                                   Choose one or more ad marker types to deco-
                                   rate your Apple HLS manifest. This  setting
                                   does  not determine whether SCTE-35 markers

                                   (string)

                               AdditionalManifests -> (list)
                                   By  default,  the   service   creates   one
                                   top-level  .m3u8  HLS manifest for each HLS
                                   output group in your job. This default man-
                                   ifest references every output in the output
                                   group. To create additional top-level mani-
                                   fests  that  reference a subset of the out-
                                   puts in the output group, specify a list of
                                   them here.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specify  the details for each additional
                                      HLS manifest that you want  the  service
                                      to  generate for this output group. Each
                                      manifest can reference a different  sub-
                                      set of outputs in the group.

                                      ManifestNameModifier -> (string)
                                          Specify  a  name  modifier  that the
                                          service adds to  the  name  of  this
                                          manifest  to  make it different from
                                          the file names  of  the  other  main
                                          manifests  in  the output group. For
                                          example, say that the  default  main
                                          manifest   for  your  HLS  group  is
                                          film-name.m3u8.   If    you    enter
                                          "-no-premium" for this setting, then
                                          the file name the service  generates
                                          for   this   top-level  manifest  is
                                          film-name-no-premium.m3u8.  For  HLS
                                          output  groups,  specify a manifest-
                                          NameModifier that is different  from
                                          the  nameModifier of the output. The
                                          service uses the output  name  modi-
                                          fier  to create unique names for the
                                          individual variant manifests.

                                      SelectedOutputs -> (list)
                                          Specify the outputs  that  you  want
                                          this  additional  top-level manifest
                                          to reference.

                                   audio-only    headers.    Choose    Exclude
                                   (EXCLUDE)  to remove the audio-only headers
                                   from your audio segments.

                                   A partial URI prefix that will be prepended
                                   to each output in the media .m3u8 file. Can
                                   be used if base manifest is delivered  from
                                   a different URL than the main .m3u8 file.

                               CaptionLanguageMappings -> (list)

                                             keys managed. AWS uses data  keys
                                             to encrypt your content. AWS also
                                             encrypts  the  data  keys   them-
                                             selves,  using  a customer master

                                             you  want  your  master key to be
                                             managed  by  AWS  Key  Management
                                             Service  (KMS),  choose  AWS  KMS
                                             (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).  By
                                             default, when you choose AWS KMS,
                                             KMS uses the AWS managed customer
                                             master  key (CMK) associated with
                                             Amazon S3 to  encrypt  your  data

                                             alongside your KMS key.  AWS  KMS
                                             uses  this  encryption context as
                                             additional   authenticated   data
                                             (AAD)  to  support  authenticated

                                             Optionally,  specify the customer
                                             master key (CMK) that you want to
                                             use  to encrypt the data key that
                                             AWS uses to encrypt  your  output
                                             content.    Enter    the   Amazon

                                   ConstantInitializationVector -> (string)
                                      This is a  128-bit,  16-byte  hex  value
                                      represented   by   a  32-character  text
                                      string. If this  parameter  is  not  set
                                      then the Initialization Vector will fol-
                                      low the segment number by default.

                                   EncryptionMethod -> (string)

                                      interface also disables encryption.

                                   InitializationVectorInManifest -> (string)
                                      The  Initialization  Vector is a 128-bit
                                      number used in conjunction with the  key
                                      for   encrypting   blocks.   If  set  to
                                      INCLUDE, Initialization Vector is listed
                                      in  the  manifest. Otherwise Initializa-

                                   IntervalCadence -> (string)
                                      The  cadence  MediaConvert  follows  for
                                      generating  thumbnails.  If  set to FOL-
                                      LOW_IFRAME,    MediaConvert    generates
                                      thumbnails  for  each  IDR  frame in the
                                      output (matching the  GOP  cadence).  If
                                      set  to FOLLOW_CUSTOM, MediaConvert gen-
                                      erates  thumbnails  according   to   the
                                      interval  you specify in thumbnailInter-
                                      val.

                                   ThumbnailHeight -> (integer)
                                      Height of  each  thumbnail  within  each
                                      tile  image,  in  pixels. Leave blank to
                                      maintain  aspect  ratio  with  thumbnail
                                      width.  If  following  the  aspect ratio
                                      would  lead  to  a  total  tile   height
                                      greater  than 4096, then the job will be
                                      rejected. Must be divisible by 2.

                                   ThumbnailInterval -> (double)
                                      Enter the  interval,  in  seconds,  that
                                      MediaConvert  uses  to  generate  thumb-
                                      nails. If the interval you enter doesn't
                                      align with the output frame rate, Media-
                                      Convert automatically rounds the  inter-
                                      val to align with the output frame rate.
                                      For example, if the output frame rate is
                                      29.97 frames per second and you enter 5,
                                      MediaConvert uses a 150  frame  interval
                                      to generate thumbnails.

                                   ThumbnailWidth -> (integer)
                                      Width of each thumbnail within each tile
                                      image, in pixels. Default is  312.  Must
                                      be divisible by 8.

                                   TileHeight -> (integer)
                                      Number of thumbnails in each column of a
                                      tile image. Set a value  between  2  and
                                      2048. Must be divisible by 2.

                                   TileWidth -> (integer)
                                      Number  of  thumbnails  in each row of a
                                      tile image. Set a value  between  1  and
                                      512.

                               ManifestCompression -> (string)
                                   When  set to GZIP, compresses HLS playlist.

                               ManifestDurationFormat -> (string)
                                   Indicates  whether  the   output   manifest
                                   should  use  floating point values for seg-
                                   ment duration.

                               MinFinalSegmentLength -> (double)
                                   Keep this setting at the default  value  of
                                   0, unless you are troubleshooting a problem
                                   with how devices play back the end of  your
                                   video   asset.  If  you  know  that  player
                                   devices are hanging on the final segment of
                                   your video because the length of your final
                                   segment is too short, use this  setting  to
                                   specify  a minimum final segment length, in
                                   seconds. Choose a  value  that  is  greater
                                   than  or equal to 1 and less than your seg-
                                   ment length. When you specify a  value  for
                                   this  setting, the encoder will combine any
                                   final segment  that  is  shorter  than  the
                                   length  that  you specify with the previous
                                   segment. For example, your  segment  length
                                   is  3  seconds and your final segment is .5
                                   seconds without  a  minimum  final  segment
                                   length; when you set the minimum final seg-
                                   ment length to 1, your final segment is 3.5
                                   seconds.

                               MinSegmentLength -> (integer)
                                   When  set, Minimum Segment Size is enforced
                                   by looking ahead and back within the speci-
                                   fied range for a nearby avail and extending
                                   the segment size if needed.

                               OutputSelection -> (string)
                                   Indicates whether the .m3u8  manifest  file
                                   should  be  generated  for  this HLS output
                                   group.

                               ProgramDateTime -> (string)

                                   GRAM-DATE-TIME tag in .m3u8 manifest files.
                                   The value is calculated as follows:  either
                                   the  program  date and time are initialized
                                   using the input  timecode  source,  or  the
                                   time  is  initialized using the input time-
                                   code source and  the  date  is  initialized

                                   Period    of    insertion   of   EXT-X-PRO-
                                   GRAM-DATE-TIME entry, in seconds.

                               SegmentControl -> (string)
                                   When set to SINGLE_FILE, emits program as a
                                   single  media  resource  (.ts)  file,  uses
                                   #EXT-X-BYTERANGE tags to index segment  for
                                   playback.

                               SegmentLength -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the  length,  in whole seconds, of
                                   each segment.  When  you  don't  specify  a
                                   value, MediaConvert defaults to 10. Related
                                   settings: Use Segment length control  (Seg-
                                   mentLengthControl)  to  specify whether the
                                   encoder enforces this value  strictly.  Use
                                   Segment   control   (HlsSegmentControl)  to
                                   specify whether MediaConvert creates  sepa-

                                   aries.

                               SegmentLengthControl -> (string)
                                   Specify how you want MediaConvert to deter-
                                   mine  the  segment  length.  Choose   Exact
                                   (EXACT)  to  have the encoder use the exact
                                   length that you specify  with  the  setting
                                   Segment  length (SegmentLength). This might
                                   result in extra I-frames.  Choose  Multiple
                                   of  GOP  (GOP_MULTIPLE) to have the encoder
                                   round up the segment lengths to  match  the
                                   next GOP boundary.

                               SegmentsPerSubdirectory -> (integer)
                                   Number  of segments to write to a subdirec-
                                   tory before starting a new one. directoryS-

                               StreamInfResolution -> (string)
                                   Include or exclude RESOLUTION attribute for
                                   video  in  EXT-X-STREAM-INF  tag of variant

                               TargetDurationCompatibilityMode -> (string)
                                   When set  to  LEGACY,  the  segment  target
                                   duration  is always rounded up to the near-
                                   est integer value above its  current  value
                                   in  seconds.  When  set to SPEC\_COMPLIANT,
                                   the segment target duration is  rounded  up
                                   to  the  nearest  integer value if fraction
                                   seconds are greater than or  equal  to  0.5
                                   (>=  0.5) and rounded down if less than 0.5
                                   (<0.5). You may need to use LEGACY if  your
                                   client  needs  to  ensure  that  the target
                                   duration is always longer than  the  actual
                                   duration of the segment. Some older players
                                   may experience  interrupted  playback  when
                                   the actual duration of a track in a segment
                                   is longer than the target duration.

                               TimedMetadataId3Frame -> (string)
                                   Indicates ID3 frame that has the  timecode.

                               TimedMetadataId3Period -> (integer)
                                   Timed Metadata interval in seconds.

                                   Provides  an extra millisecond delta offset
                                   to fine tune the timestamps.

                                      this output  group.  Each  manifest  can
                                      reference  a different subset of outputs
                                      in the group.

                                   Use Destination  (Destination)  to  specify
                                   the S3 output location and the output file-
                                   name base. Destination accepts format iden-
                                   tifiers.  If  you  do  not specify the base
                                   filename in the URI, the service  will  use
                                   the filename of the input file. If your job
                                   has multiple inputs, the service  uses  the
                                   filename of the first input file.

                               DestinationSettings -> (structure)
                                   Settings  associated  with the destination.
                                   Will vary based on the type of destination

                                      an   instance   of  AudioDescription  is
                                      equivalent to one audio tab in the  con-
                                      sole. Usually, one audio tab corresponds
                                      to one output audio track. Depending  on
                                      how  you  set up your input audio selec-
                                      tors and whether you use audio  selector
                                      groups,  one audio tab can correspond to
                                      a group of output audio tracks.

                                          When you mimic a multi-channel audio
                                          layout  with  multiple  mono-channel
                                          tracks,  you  can  tag  each channel
                                          layout manually.  For  example,  you
                                          would  tag  the  tracks that contain
                                          your left, right, and  center  audio
                                          with Left (L), Right (R), and Center
                                          (C), respectively.  When  you  don't
                                          specify a value, MediaConvert labels
                                          your track as Center (C) by default.
                                          To  use  audio  layout tagging, your
                                          output must be in a QuickTime (.mov)
                                          container;  your audio codec must be
                                          AAC, WAV, or AIFF; and you must  set
                                          up your audio track to have only one
                                          channel.

                                          ChannelTag -> (string)
                                             You  can  add  a  tag  for   this
                                             mono-channel audio track to mimic
                                             its placement in a  multi-channel
                                             layout.   For  example,  if  this
                                             track is the left surround  chan-
                                             nel, choose Left surround (LS).

                                      AudioSourceName -> (string)
                                          Specifies which audio  data  to  use
                                          from  each  input.  In  the simplest
                                          case,  specify  an   "Audio   Selec-

                                          based  on  its  order  within   each
                                          input.  For  example  if you specify
                                          "Audio Selector 3", then  the  third
                                          audio  selector  will  be  used from
                                          each input. If  an  input  does  not
                                          have an "Audio Selector 3", then the
                                          audio selector marked  as  "default"
                                          in that input will be used. If there
                                          is  no  audio  selector  marked   as
                                          "default",  silence will be inserted
                                          for  the  duration  of  that  input.
                                          Alternatively,  an  "Audio  Selector

                                          name  may be specified, with similar
                                          default/silence  behavior.   If   no
                                          audio_source_name is specified, then
                                          "Audio Selector 1"  will  be  chosen
                                          automatically.

                                      This  object  holds  groups  of settings
                                      related to captions for one output.  For

                                          puts  this  language  information in
                                          the  output  captions  metadata.  If
                                          your   output   captions  format  is
                                          DVB-Sub or Burn in, the encoder uses
                                          this language information when auto-

                                          for rendering the captions text. For
                                          all outputs,  you  can  use  an  ISO
                                          639-2 or ISO 639-3 code. For stream-

                                          on the MediaConvert console. In your
                                          job JSON, an  instance  of  captions
                                          DestinationSettings is equivalent to
                                          one captions  tab  in  the  console.
                                          Usually,  one  captions  tab  corre-
                                          sponds to one output captions track.
                                          Depending  on  your  output captions
                                          format, one tab might correspond  to
                                          a set of output captions tracks. For

                                          MediaConvert  pads  the output audio
                                          streams with silence or  trims  them
                                          to ensure that the total duration of
                                          each audio stream  is  at  least  as
                                          long  as  the  total duration of the
                                          video stream. After padding or trim-
                                          ming,  the  audio stream duration is
                                          no more than one frame  longer  than
                                          the   video   stream.   MediaConvert
                                          applies audio  padding  or  trimming
                                          only  to the end of the last segment
                                          of the output. For unsegmented  out-
                                          puts, MediaConvert adds padding only
                                          to the end of  the  file.  When  you
                                          keep  the  default  value, any minor
                                          discrepancies  between   audio   and
                                          video  duration  will depend on your

                                   M2tsSettings -> (structure)
                                      MPEG-2   TS  container  settings.  These
                                      apply to outputs in a File output  group
                                      when  the output's container (Container-
                                      Type) is MPEG-2 Transport Stream (M2TS).
                                      In  these  assets,  data is organized by
                                      the program map table (PMT). Each trans-
                                      port  stream program contains subsets of
                                      data, including audio, video, and  meta-
                                      data.  Each of these subsets of data has
                                      a numerical label called a packet  iden-
                                      tifier (PID). Each transport stream pro-
                                      gram  corresponds  to  one  MediaConvert
                                      output.  The PMT lists the types of data
                                      in a program along with their PID. Down-
                                      stream  systems and players use the pro-
                                      gram map table to look up  the  PID  for
                                      each  type  of data it accesses and then
                                      uses the PIDs to  locate  specific  data
                                      within the asset.

                                      AudioBufferModel -> (string)
                                          Selects  between  the  DVB  and ATSC
                                          buffer  models  for  Dolby   Digital
                                          audio.

                                      AudioDuration -> (string)
                                          Specify  this setting only when your
                                          output will be consumed by  a  down-
                                          stream  repackaging workflow that is
                                          sensitive  to  very  small  duration
                                          differences between video and audio.
                                          For  this  situation,  choose  Match
                                          video   duration  (MATCH_VIDEO_DURA-
                                          TION). In all other cases, keep  the
                                          default  value,  Default codec dura-
                                          tion (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION).  When
                                          you  choose  Match  video  duration,
                                          MediaConvert pads the  output  audio
                                          streams  with  silence or trims them
                                          to ensure that the total duration of
                                          each  audio  stream  is  at least as
                                          long as the total  duration  of  the
                                          video stream. After padding or trim-
                                          ming, the audio stream  duration  is
                                          no  more  than one frame longer than
                                          the   video   stream.   MediaConvert
                                          applies  audio  padding  or trimming
                                          only to the end of the last  segment
                                          of  the output. For unsegmented out-
                                          puts, MediaConvert adds padding only
                                          to  the  end  of  the file. When you
                                          keep the default  value,  any  minor
                                          discrepancies   between   audio  and
                                          video duration will depend  on  your
                                          output audio codec.

                                      AudioFramesPerPes -> (integer)
                                          The number of audio frames to insert
                                          for each PES packet.

                                      AudioPids -> (list)
                                          Specify   the   packet   identifiers
                                          (PIDs)   for  any  elementary  audio
                                          streams you include in this  output.
                                          Specify  multiple  PIDs  as  a  JSON
                                          array. Default is the range 482-492.

                                      Bitrate -> (integer)
                                          Specify  the  output  bitrate of the
                                          transport stream in bits per second.
                                          Setting to 0 lets the muxer automat-
                                          ically  determine  the   appropriate
                                          bitrate.  Other  common  values  are
                                          3750000, 7500000, and 15000000.

                                      BufferModel -> (string)
                                          Controls what buffer  model  to  use
                                          for accurate interleaving. If set to
                                          MULTIPLEX,  use   multiplex   buffer
                                          model. If set to NONE, this can lead
                                          to  lower  latency,  but  low-memory
                                          devices may not be able to play back
                                          the stream without interruptions.

                                          if  a  downstream  encryption system
                                          requires periodic null packets.

                                          mentary Stream (PES) header. This is
                                          effective only when the PCR  PID  is
                                          the  same as the video or audio ele-

                                          specify  a  value,  the service will
                                          use  the   value   for   Video   PID
                                          (VideoPid).

                                          specified  bitrate. When set to VBR,
                                          the bitrate setting acts as the max-
                                          imum  bitrate,  but  the output will
                                          not be padded up to that bitrate.

                                      SegmentationStyle -> (string)
                                          The  segmentation  style   parameter
                                          controls  how  segmentation  markers
                                          are  inserted  into  the   transport
                                          stream.  With avails, it is possible
                                          that  segments  may  be   truncated,
                                          which  can  influence  where  future
                                          segmentation markers  are  inserted.
                                          When   a   segmentation   style   of
                                          "reset_cadence" is  selected  and  a
                                          segment   is  truncated  due  to  an
                                          avail, we will reset  the  segmenta-
                                          tion  cadence. This means the subse-
                                          quent segment will have  a  duration
                                          of  of  $segmentation_time  seconds.
                                          When a segmentation style of  "main-
                                          tain_cadence" is selected and a seg-
                                          ment is truncated due to  an  avail,
                                          we  will  not reset the segmentation
                                          cadence. This means  the  subsequent
                                          segment  will likely be truncated as
                                          well. However,  all  segments  after
                                          that  will  have a duration of $seg-
                                          mentation_time  seconds.  Note  that
                                          EBP  lookahead is a slight exception
                                          to this rule.

                                      SegmentationTime -> (double)
                                          Specify the length, in  seconds,  of
                                          each  segment. Required unless mark-
                                          ers is set to _none_.

                                          Specify the packet identifier  (PID)
                                          for  timed  metadata in this output.
                                          Default is 502.

                                      TransportStreamId -> (integer)
                                          Specify the  ID  for  the  transport
                                          stream itself in the program map ta-
                                          ble  for  this   output.   Transport
                                          stream  IDs  and  program map tables
                                          are parts of MPEG-2 transport stream
                                          containers,   used   for  organizing
                                          data.

                                      VideoPid -> (integer)
                                          Specify the packet identifier  (PID)
                                          of  the  elementary  video stream in
                                          the transport stream.

                                   M3u8Settings -> (structure)
                                      These  settings  relate  to  the  MPEG-2
                                      transport  stream  (MPEG2-TS)  container
                                      for the MPEG2-TS segments  in  your  HLS
                                      outputs.

                                      AudioDuration -> (string)
                                          Specify  this setting only when your
                                          output will be consumed by  a  down-
                                          stream  repackaging workflow that is
                                          sensitive  to  very  small  duration
                                          differences between video and audio.
                                          For  this  situation,  choose  Match
                                          video   duration  (MATCH_VIDEO_DURA-
                                          TION). In all other cases, keep  the
                                          default  value,  Default codec dura-
                                          tion (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION).  When
                                          you  choose  Match  video  duration,
                                          MediaConvert pads the  output  audio
                                          streams  with  silence or trims them
                                          to ensure that the total duration of
                                          each  audio  stream  is  at least as
                                          long as the total  duration  of  the
                                          video stream. After padding or trim-
                                          ming, the audio stream  duration  is
                                          no  more  than one frame longer than
                                          the   video   stream.   MediaConvert
                                          applies  audio  padding  or trimming
                                          only to the end of the last  segment
                                          of  the output. For unsegmented out-
                                          puts, MediaConvert adds padding only
                                          to  the  end  of  the file. When you
                                          keep the default  value,  any  minor
                                          discrepancies   between   audio  and
                                          video duration will depend  on  your
                                          output audio codec.

                                      AudioFramesPerPes -> (integer)
                                          The number of audio frames to insert

                                          will  be included per 14496-1 amend-
                                          ment 1. This improves  compatibility
                                          with Apple players and tools.

                                      Mpeg2FourCCControl -> (string)
                                          When  set  to  XDCAM,  writes  MPEG2
                                          video  streams  into  the  QuickTime
                                          file  using XDCAM fourcc codes. This
                                          increases compatibility  with  Apple
                                          editors   and   players,   but   may
                                          decrease  compatibility  with  other
                                          players.  Only  applicable  when the
                                          video codec is MPEG2.

                                      PaddingControl -> (string)
                                          To make this output compatible  with
                                          Omenon,   keep  the  default  value,
                                          OMNEON. Unless you need Omneon  com-
                                          patibility,  set this value to NONE.
                                          When you  keep  the  default  value,
                                          OMNEON,  MediaConvert  increases the
                                          length of the edit list  atom.  This
                                          might  cause  file rejections when a
                                          recipient of the output file doesn't
                                          expct this extra padding.

                                      Reference -> (string)
                                          Always   keep   the   default  value
                                          (SELF_CONTAINED) for this setting.

                                   Mp4Settings -> (structure)
                                      These settings relate to your MP4 output
                                      container.  You  can  create  audio only

                                      AudioDuration -> (string)
                                          Specify  this setting only when your
                                          output will be consumed by  a  down-
                                          stream  repackaging workflow that is
                                          sensitive  to  very  small  duration
                                          differences between video and audio.
                                          For  this  situation,  choose  Match

                                          TION). In all other cases, keep  the
                                          default  value,  Default codec dura-
                                          tion (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION).  When
                                          you  choose  Match  video  duration,
                                          MediaConvert pads the  output  audio
                                          streams  with  silence or trims them
                                          to ensure that the total duration of
                                          each  audio  stream  is  at least as
                                          long as the total  duration  of  the
                                          video stream. After padding or trim-
                                          ming, the audio stream  duration  is
                                          no  more  than one frame longer than
                                          the   video   stream.   MediaConvert
                                          applies  audio  padding  or trimming
                                          only to the end of the last  segment
                                          of  the output. For unsegmented out-

                                          with Apple players and tools.

                                      CttsVersion -> (integer)
                                          Ignore  this  setting unless compli-

                                          fication  matters  in your workflow.
                                          Specify a value of  1  to  set  your
                                          CTTS  box version to 1 and make your
                                          output compliant with the specifica-
                                          tion. When you specify a value of 1,
                                          you must also set  CSLG  atom  (csl-
                                          gAtom)  to  the  value INCLUDE. Keep
                                          the default value 0 to set your CTTS
                                          box  version  to 0. This can provide
                                          backward  compatibility   for   some
                                          players and packagers.

                                      FreeSpaceBox -> (string)

                                          Optional. Choose  Include  (INCLUDE)
                                          to  have  MediaConvert  mark up your

                                          isn't generally required,  but  some
                                          video players require it to discover
                                          and play embedded 608 captions. Keep
                                          the     default    value,    Exclude
                                          (EXCLUDE), to leave  these  elements
                                          out.  When  you enable this setting,
                                          this is the markup that MediaConvert
                                          includes in your manifest:

                                      AudioDuration -> (string)
                                          Specify  this setting only when your
                                          output will be consumed by  a  down-
                                          stream  repackaging workflow that is
                                          sensitive  to  very  small  duration
                                          differences between video and audio.
                                          For  this  situation,  choose  Match

                                          TION). In all other cases, keep  the
                                          default  value,  Default codec dura-
                                          tion (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION).  When
                                          you  choose  Match  video  duration,

                                          to ensure that the total duration of
                                          each  audio  stream  is  at least as
                                          long as the total  duration  of  the
                                          video stream. After padding or trim-
                                          ming, the audio stream  duration  is
                                          no  more  than one frame longer than
                                          the   video   stream.   MediaConvert
                                          applies  audio  padding  or trimming
                                          only to the end of the last  segment
                                          of  the output. For unsegmented out-
                                          puts, MediaConvert adds padding only
                                          to  the  end  of  the file. When you
                                          keep the default  value,  any  minor
                                          discrepancies   between   audio  and
                                          video duration will depend  on  your

                                   name as part of your destination URI.  When
                                   you  create  multiple  outputs  in the same

                                   is  required.  Name  modifier  also accepts
                                   format identifiers. For DASH  ISO  outputs,
                                   if  you use the format identifiers $Number$
                                   or $Time$ in one output, you must use  them
                                   in  the same way in all outputs of the out-
                                   put group.

                                             We recommend using drop duplicate
                                             (DUPLICATE_DROP) for  numerically
                                             simple  conversions,  such  as 60
                                             fps to 30  fps.  For  numerically
                                             complex  conversions, you can use
                                             interpolate   (INTERPOLATE)    to
                                             avoid  stutter. This results in a
                                             smooth picture, but might  intro-

                                             from  its  original  cadence, use
                                             FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER)  to  do
                                             motion-compensated interpolation.
                                             FrameFormer chooses the best con-

                                             Note   that   using   FrameFormer
                                             increases  the  transcoding  time
                                             and incurs a  significant  add-on

                                             Specify  the  AVC-Intra  class of
                                             your output. The AVC-Intra  class
                                             selection  determines  the output
                                             video bit rate depending  on  the
                                             frame rate of the output. Outputs
                                             with  higher  class  values  have
                                             higher   bitrates   and  improved
                                             image  quality.  Note  that   for

                                             QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                                 Optional. Use Quality  tuning
                                                 level (qualityTuningLevel) to
                                                 choose how  many  transcoding

                                                 your video. When  you  choose
                                                 Multi-pass (MULTI_PASS), your
                                                 video quality is  better  and
                                                 your  output  bitrate is more
                                                 accurate. That is, the actual
                                                 bitrate  of  your  output  is
                                                 closer to the target  bitrate
                                                 defined in the specification.
                                                 When you  choose  Single-pass
                                                 (SINGLE_PASS),  your encoding
                                                 time is faster.  The  default
                                                 behavior is Single-pass (SIN-
                                                 GLE_PASS).

                                          FramerateControl -> (string)
                                             If you are using the console, use
                                             the  Framerate setting to specify
                                             the frame rate for  this  output.
                                             If  you  want  to  keep  the same
                                             frame rate as  the  input  video,

                                             choose  a  frame  rate  from  the

                                             We recommend using drop duplicate
                                             (DUPLICATE_DROP)  for numerically
                                             simple conversions,  such  as  60
                                             fps  to  30  fps. For numerically
                                             complex conversions, you can  use
                                             interpolate    (INTERPOLATE)   to
                                             avoid stutter. This results in  a
                                             smooth  picture, but might intro-
                                             duce undesirable video artifacts.

                                             video  has already been converted
                                             from its  original  cadence,  use
                                             FrameFormer  (FRAMEFORMER)  to do
                                             motion-compensated interpolation.
                                             FrameFormer chooses the best con-
                                             version method  frame  by  frame.
                                             Note   that   using   FrameFormer
                                             increases  the  transcoding  time
                                             and  incurs  a significant add-on
                                             cost.

                                             rate  is half of your input frame
                                             rate. In this  situation,  choose

                                             from  the input corresponds to an

                                             To use optimized interlacing, you
                                             must  set  Telecine (telecine) to
                                             None (NONE) or Soft  (SOFT).  You
                                             can't  use  optimized interlacing
                                             for hard  telecine  outputs.  You
                                             must   also  set  Interlace  mode

                                             We recommend using drop duplicate

                                             increases  the  transcoding  time
                                             and incurs a  significant  add-on

                                             When   you   use   the   API  for
                                             transcode  jobs  that  use  frame
                                             rate   conversion,   specify  the
                                             frame rate  as  a  fraction.  For
                                             example,  24000  /  1001 = 23.976
                                             fps.  Use  FramerateNumerator  to
                                             specify  the  numerator  of  this
                                             fraction. In  this  example,  use
                                             24000  for  the  value of Framer-
                                             ateNumerator. When  you  use  the
                                             console  for  transcode jobs that
                                             use frame rate  conversion,  pro-

                                          GopBReference -> (string)
                                             If enable, use reference B frames
                                             for GOP structures  that  have  B
                                             frames > 1.

                                          GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                                             Specify the relative frequency of
                                             open to closed GOPs in this  out-
                                             put.  For example, if you want to
                                             allow four  open  GOPs  and  then
                                             require  a  closed  GOP, set this
                                             value to 5. We recommend that you
                                             have the transcoder automatically
                                             choose this value for  you  based
                                             on  characteristics of your input
                                             video. To enable  this  automatic
                                             behavior,  keep the default value
                                             by leaving this  setting  out  of
                                             your  JSON  job specification. In
                                             the console, do this  by  keeping
                                             the  default  empty value. If you
                                             do explicitly  specify  a  value,
                                             for  segmented outputs, don't set
                                             this value to 0.

                                          GopSize -> (double)
                                             Use this setting  only  when  you
                                             set  GOP  mode control (GopSizeU-
                                             nits)   to   Specified,    frames
                                             (FRAMES)  or  Specified,  seconds
                                             (SECONDS). Specify the GOP length
                                             using a whole number of frames or
                                             a decimal value of seconds. Medi-
                                             aConvert   will   interpret  this
                                             value  as   frames   or   seconds
                                             depending on the value you choose
                                             for GOP mode  control  (GopSizeU-
                                             nits). If you want to allow Medi-

                                             mine  GOP  size,  leave  GOP size
                                             blank and set GOP mode control to
                                             Auto (AUTO). If your output group
                                             specifies  HLS,  DASH,  or  CMAF,
                                             leave  GOP size blank and set GOP
                                             mode control to Auto in each out-
                                             put in your output group.

                                          GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                                             Specify how the transcoder deter-
                                             mines GOP size for  this  output.
                                             We  recommend  that  you have the
                                             transcoder  automatically  choose
                                             this value for you based on char-
                                             acteristics of your input  video.
                                             To  enable  this automatic behav-
                                             ior, choose Auto (AUTO)  and  and
                                             leave  GOP  size (GopSize) blank.
                                             By default, if you don't  specify
                                             GOP  mode control (GopSizeUnits),
                                             MediaConvert will  use  automatic
                                             behavior.  If  your  output group
                                             specifies HLS, DASH, or CMAF, set
                                             GOP  mode  control  to  Auto  and
                                             leave GOP size blank in each out-
                                             put  in  your  output  group.  To
                                             explicitly   specify   the    GOP
                                             length,  choose Specified, frames
                                             (FRAMES)  or  Specified,  seconds
                                             (SECONDS)  and  then  provide the
                                             GOP length in the related setting
                                             GOP size (GopSize).

                                          (integer)
                                             Percentage  of  the  buffer  that
                                             should  initially  be filled (HRD
                                             buffer model).

                                          HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                                             Size of buffer (HRD buffer model)
                                             in  bits. For example, enter five
                                             megabits as 5000000.

                                          InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                             Choose the scan line type for the
                                             output.  Keep  the default value,

                                             ate a progressive output, regard-
                                             less of the  scan  type  of  your
                                             input.   Use   Top   field  first
                                             (TOP_FIELD) or Bottom field first
                                             (BOTTOM_FIELD)  to create an out-
                                             put that's  interlaced  with  the
                                             same  field  polarity throughout.
                                             Use  Follow,  default  top  (FOL-
                                             LOW_TOP_FIELD) or Follow, default
                                             bottom  (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD)  to
                                             produce  outputs  with  the  same
                                             field polarity as the source. For
                                             jobs  that  have multiple inputs,
                                             the output field  polarity  might
                                             change  over  the  course  of the
                                             output. Follow  behavior  depends
                                             on  the  input  scan type. If the
                                             source is interlaced, the  output
                                             will  be interlaced with the same
                                             polarity as the  source.  If  the
                                             source is progressive, the output
                                             will be interlaced with top field
                                             bottom  field first, depending on
                                             which of the Follow  options  you
                                             choose.

                                          MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                             Maximum  bitrate  in bits/second.
                                             For example, enter five  megabits
                                             per  second  as 5000000. Required
                                             when Rate control mode is QVBR.

                                          MinIInterval -> (integer)
                                             Use this setting  only  when  you
                                             also  enable  Scene change detec-
                                             tion  (SceneChangeDetect).   This
                                             setting    determines   how   the
                                             encoder   manages   the   spacing
                                             between  I-frames that it inserts
                                             as part of  the  I-frame  cadence
                                             and  the I-frames that it inserts
                                             for Scene  change  detection.  We
                                             recommend   that   you  have  the
                                             transcoder  automatically  choose
                                             this value for you based on char-
                                             acteristics of your input  video.
                                             To  enable  this automatic behav-
                                             ior, keep the  default  value  by
                                             leaving  this setting out of your
                                             JSON job  specification.  In  the
                                             console,  do  this by keeping the
                                             default  empty  value.  When  you
                                             explicitly  specify  a  value for
                                             this setting, the encoder  deter-
                                             mines    whether    to   skip   a
                                             cadence-driven  I-frame  by   the
                                             value  you  set.  For example, if
                                             you set Min I  interval  (minIIn-
                                             terval) to 5 and a cadence-driven
                                             I-frame  would  fall   within   5
                                             frames of a scene-change I-frame,
                                             then  the   encoder   skips   the
                                             cadence-driven  I-frame.  In this
                                             way, one GOP is  shrunk  slightly
                                             and    one   GOP   is   stretched
                                             slightly. When the cadence-driven
                                             I-frames  are  farther  from  the
                                             scene-change  I-frame  than   the
                                             value  you  set, then the encoder
                                             leaves all I-frames in place  and
                                             the  GOPs  surrounding  the scene
                                             change are smaller than the usual
                                             cadence GOPs.

                                             fraction. In  this  example,  use

                                          GopBReference -> (string)
                                             If enable, use reference B frames
                                             for GOP structures  that  have  B
                                             frames > 1.

                                          GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                                             Specify the relative frequency of
                                             open to closed GOPs in this  out-
                                             put.  For example, if you want to
                                             allow four  open  GOPs  and  then
                                             require  a  closed  GOP, set this
                                             value to 5. We recommend that you
                                             have the transcoder automatically
                                             choose this value for  you  based
                                             on  characteristics of your input
                                             video. To enable  this  automatic
                                             behavior,  keep the default value
                                             by leaving this  setting  out  of
                                             your  JSON  job specification. In
                                             the console, do this  by  keeping
                                             the  default  empty value. If you
                                             do explicitly  specify  a  value,
                                             for  segmented outputs, don't set
                                             this value to 0.

                                          GopSize -> (double)
                                             Use this setting  only  when  you
                                             set  GOP  mode control (GopSizeU-
                                             nits)   to   Specified,    frames
                                             (FRAMES)  or  Specified,  seconds
                                             (SECONDS). Specify the GOP length
                                             using a whole number of frames or
                                             a decimal value of seconds. Medi-
                                             aConvert   will   interpret  this
                                             value  as   frames   or   seconds
                                             depending on the value you choose
                                             for GOP mode  control  (GopSizeU-
                                             nits). If you want to allow Medi-
                                             aConvert to automatically  deter-
                                             mine  GOP  size,  leave  GOP size
                                             blank and set GOP mode control to
                                             Auto (AUTO). If your output group
                                             specifies  HLS,  DASH,  or  CMAF,
                                             leave  GOP size blank and set GOP
                                             mode control to Auto in each out-
                                             put in your output group.

                                          GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                                             Specify how the transcoder deter-
                                             mines GOP size for  this  output.
                                             We  recommend  that  you have the
                                             transcoder  automatically  choose
                                             this value for you based on char-
                                             acteristics of your input  video.
                                             To  enable  this automatic behav-
                                             ior, choose Auto (AUTO)  and  and
                                             leave  GOP  size (GopSize) blank.
                                             By default, if you don't  specify
                                             GOP  mode control (GopSizeUnits),
                                             MediaConvert will  use  automatic
                                             behavior.  If  your  output group
                                             specifies HLS, DASH, or CMAF, set
                                             GOP  mode  control  to  Auto  and
                                             leave GOP size blank in each out-
                                             put  in  your  output  group.  To
                                             explicitly   specify   the    GOP
                                             length,  choose Specified, frames
                                             (FRAMES)  or  Specified,  seconds
                                             (SECONDS)  and  then  provide the
                                             GOP length in the related setting
                                             GOP size (GopSize).

                                          HrdBufferInitialFillPercentage    ->
                                          (integer)
                                             Percentage  of  the  buffer  that
                                             should  initially  be filled (HRD
                                             buffer model).

                                          HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                                             Size of buffer (HRD buffer model)
                                             in  bits. For example, enter five
                                             megabits as 5000000.

                                          InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                             Choose the scan line type for the
                                             output.  Keep  the default value,
                                             Progressive (PROGRESSIVE) to cre-
                                             ate a progressive output, regard-
                                             less of the  scan  type  of  your
                                             input.   Use   Top   field  first
                                             (TOP_FIELD) or Bottom field first
                                             (BOTTOM_FIELD)  to create an out-
                                             put that's  interlaced  with  the
                                             same  field  polarity throughout.
                                             Use  Follow,  default  top  (FOL-
                                             LOW_TOP_FIELD) or Follow, default
                                             bottom  (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD)  to
                                             produce  outputs  with  the  same
                                             field polarity as the source. For
                                             jobs  that  have multiple inputs,
                                             the output field  polarity  might
                                             change  over  the  course  of the
                                             output. Follow  behavior  depends
                                             on  the  input  scan type. If the
                                             source is interlaced, the  output
                                             will  be interlaced with the same
                                             polarity as the  source.  If  the
                                             source is progressive, the output
                                             will be interlaced with top field
                                             bottom  field first, depending on
                                             which of the Follow  options  you
                                             choose.

                                          MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                             Maximum  bitrate  in bits/second.
                                             For example, enter five  megabits
                                             per  second  as 5000000. Required
                                             when Rate control mode is QVBR.

                                          MinIInterval -> (integer)
                                             Use this setting  only  when  you
                                             also  enable  Scene change detec-
                                             tion  (SceneChangeDetect).   This
                                             setting    determines   how   the
                                             encoder   manages   the   spacing
                                             between  I-frames that it inserts
                                             as part of  the  I-frame  cadence
                                             and  the I-frames that it inserts
                                             for Scene  change  detection.  We
                                             recommend   that   you  have  the
                                             transcoder  automatically  choose
                                             this value for you based on char-
                                             acteristics of your input  video.
                                             To  enable  this automatic behav-
                                             ior, keep the  default  value  by
                                             leaving  this setting out of your
                                             JSON job  specification.  In  the
                                             console,  do  this by keeping the
                                             default  empty  value.  When  you
                                             explicitly  specify  a  value for
                                             this setting, the encoder  deter-
                                             mines    whether    to   skip   a
                                             cadence-driven  I-frame  by   the
                                             value  you  set.  For example, if
                                             you set Min I  interval  (minIIn-
                                             terval) to 5 and a cadence-driven
                                             I-frame  would  fall   within   5
                                             frames of a scene-change I-frame,
                                             then  the   encoder   skips   the
                                             cadence-driven  I-frame.  In this
                                             way, one GOP is  shrunk  slightly
                                             and    one   GOP   is   stretched
                                             slightly. When the cadence-driven
                                             I-frames  are  farther  from  the
                                             scene-change  I-frame  than   the
                                             value  you  set, then the encoder
                                             leaves all I-frames in place  and
                                             the  GOPs  surrounding  the scene
                                             change are smaller than the usual
                                             cadence GOPs.

                                             from  the input corresponds to an

                                             To use optimized interlacing, you
                                             must  set  Telecine (telecine) to

                                             for hard  telecine  outputs.  You
                                             must   also  set  Interlace  mode

                                             enabling   this   setting    will
                                             slightly  reduce  the duration of
                                             your  video.  Required  settings:
                                             You  must  also  set Framerate to

                                             feature, the encoder  uses  fewer
                                             bits  on  areas  that can sustain
                                             more distortion with  no  notice-

                                             more  bits  on  areas  where  any
                                             small  distortion will be notice-
                                             able. For example,  complex  tex-
                                             tured  blocks  are  encoded  with
                                             fewer bits  and  smooth  textured
                                             blocks   are  encoded  with  more
                                             bits. Enabling this feature  will
                                             almost  always improve your video
                                             quality. Note, though, that  this
                                             feature doesn't take into account

                                             We recommend using drop duplicate
                                             (DUPLICATE_DROP) for  numerically
                                             simple  conversions,  such  as 60
                                             fps to 30  fps.  For  numerically
                                             complex  conversions, you can use
                                             interpolate   (INTERPOLATE)    to
                                             avoid  stutter. This results in a

                                             Note   that   using   FrameFormer
                                             increases  the  transcoding  time
                                             and incurs a  significant  add-on

                                             produce  outputs  with  the  same
                                             field polarity as the source. For
                                             jobs that have  multiple  inputs,
                                             the  output  field polarity might

                                             on the input scan  type.  If  the
                                             source  is interlaced, the output
                                             will be interlaced with the  same
                                             polarity  as  the  source. If the
                                             source is progressive, the output
                                             will be interlaced with top field
                                             bottom field first, depending  on
                                             which  of  the Follow options you
                                             choose.

                                             you choose the  value  auto,  the
                                             service will automatically select
                                             the  precision   based   on   the

                                          MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                             Maximum  bitrate  in bits/second.
                                             For example, enter five  megabits
                                             per second as 5000000.

                                          MinIInterval -> (integer)
                                             Use  this  setting  only when you
                                             also enable Scene  change  detec-
                                             tion   (SceneChangeDetect).  This
                                             setting   determines   how    the
                                             encoder   manages   the   spacing
                                             between I-frames that it  inserts
                                             as  part  of  the I-frame cadence
                                             and the I-frames that it  inserts
                                             for  Scene change detection. When
                                             you specify a value for this set-
                                             ting,   the   encoder  determines
                                             whether to skip a  cadence-driven
                                             I-frame by the value you set. For
                                             example, if you set Min I  inter-
                                             val  (minIInterval)  to  5  and a
                                             cadence-driven I-frame would fall
                                             within 5 frames of a scene-change
                                             I-frame, then the  encoder  skips
                                             the  cadence-driven  I-frame.  In
                                             this  way,  one  GOP  is   shrunk
                                             slightly and one GOP is stretched
                                             slightly. When the cadence-driven
                                             I-frames  are  farther  from  the
                                             scene-change  I-frame  than   the
                                             value  you  set, then the encoder
                                             leaves all I-frames in place  and
                                             the  GOPs  surrounding  the scene
                                             change are smaller than the usual
                                             cadence GOPs.

                                             Valid  values  are  whole numbers
                                             from 0 through 7. When you  don't
                                             specify   a  value,  MediaConvert
                                             defaults to 2.

                                             setting,  you  must  also specify
                                             values for the  parNumerator  and
                                             parDenominator settings.

                                          ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                             Required   when   you  set  Pixel

                                             SPECIFIED.  On  the console, this
                                             corresponds to  any  value  other
                                             than   Follow  source.  When  you

                                             For  example,  for   D1/DV   NTSC
                                             widescreen, you would specify the
                                             ratio 40:33. In this example, the
                                             value for parDenominator is 33.

                                          ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                             Required   when   you  set  Pixel

                                             this case, each progressive frame
                                             from the input corresponds to  an
                                             interlaced  field  in the output.
                                             Keep  the  default  value,  Basic

                                             We recommend using drop duplicate
                                             (DUPLICATE_DROP)  for numerically
                                             simple conversions,  such  as  60
                                             fps  to  30  fps. For numerically
                                             complex conversions, you can  use
                                             interpolate    (INTERPOLATE)   to
                                             avoid stutter. This results in  a
                                             smooth  picture, but might intro-
                                             duce undesirable video artifacts.

                                             video  has already been converted
                                             from its  original  cadence,  use
                                             FrameFormer  (FRAMEFORMER)  to do
                                             motion-compensated interpolation.
                                             FrameFormer chooses the best con-
                                             version method  frame  by  frame.
                                             Note   that   using   FrameFormer
                                             increases  the  transcoding  time
                                             and  incurs  a significant add-on
                                             cost.

                                             We recommend using drop duplicate
                                             (DUPLICATE_DROP) for  numerically
                                             simple  conversions,  such  as 60
                                             fps to 30  fps.  For  numerically
                                             complex  conversions, you can use
                                             interpolate   (INTERPOLATE)    to
                                             avoid  stutter. This results in a
                                             smooth picture, but might  intro-
                                             duce undesirable video artifacts.

                                             from  its  original  cadence, use
                                             FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER)  to  do
                                             motion-compensated interpolation.
                                             FrameFormer chooses the best con-

                                             Note   that   using   FrameFormer
                                             increases  the  transcoding  time
                                             and incurs a  significant  add-on
                                             cost.

                                             We recommend using drop duplicate
                                             (DUPLICATE_DROP)  for numerically
                                             simple conversions,  such  as  60
                                             fps  to  30  fps. For numerically
                                             complex conversions, you can  use
                                             interpolate    (INTERPOLATE)   to
                                             avoid stutter. This results in  a
                                             smooth  picture, but might intro-

                                             from its  original  cadence,  use
                                             FrameFormer  (FRAMEFORMER)  to do
                                             motion-compensated interpolation.
                                             FrameFormer chooses the best con-

                                             Note   that   using   FrameFormer
                                             increases  the  transcoding  time
                                             and  incurs  a significant add-on
                                             cost.

                                             For   example,   for  D1/DV  NTSC
                                             widescreen, you would specify the
                                             ratio 40:33. In this example, the
                                             value for parNumerator is 40.

                                          QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                             Optional.  Use   Quality   tuning

                                             Target  bitrate  in  bits/second.
                                             For  example, enter five megabits
                                             per second as 5000000.

                                          FramerateControl -> (string)
                                             If you are using the console, use
                                             the  Framerate setting to specify
                                             the frame rate for  this  output.
                                             If  you  want  to  keep  the same

                                             We recommend using drop duplicate
                                             (DUPLICATE_DROP)  for numerically
                                             simple conversions,  such  as  60
                                             fps  to  30  fps. For numerically
                                             complex conversions, you can  use
                                             interpolate    (INTERPOLATE)   to
                                             avoid stutter. This results in  a
                                             smooth  picture, but might intro-
                                             duce undesirable video artifacts.

                                             video  has already been converted
                                             from its  original  cadence,  use
                                             FrameFormer  (FRAMEFORMER)  to do
                                             motion-compensated interpolation.
                                             FrameFormer chooses the best con-
                                             version method  frame  by  frame.
                                             Note   that   using   FrameFormer
                                             increases  the  transcoding  time
                                             and  incurs  a significant add-on
                                             cost.

                                             For  example,  for   D1/DV   NTSC
                                             widescreen, you would specify the
                                             ratio 40:33. In this example, the
                                             value for parDenominator is 33.

                                          ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                             Required   when   you  set  Pixel

                                             If you are using the console, use
                                             the Frame rate setting to specify
                                             the  frame  rate for this output.
                                             If you  want  to  keep  the  same

                                             We recommend using drop duplicate
                                             (DUPLICATE_DROP) for  numerically
                                             simple  conversions,  such  as 60
                                             fps to 30  fps.  For  numerically
                                             complex  conversions, you can use
                                             interpolate   (INTERPOLATE)    to
                                             avoid  stutter. This results in a
                                             smooth picture, but might  intro-
                                             duce undesirable video artifacts.

                                             video has already been  converted
                                             from  its  original  cadence, use
                                             FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER)  to  do
                                             motion-compensated interpolation.
                                             FrameFormer chooses the best con-
                                             version  method  frame  by frame.
                                             Note   that   using   FrameFormer
                                             increases  the  transcoding  time
                                             and incurs a  significant  add-on

                                      Applies  only to 29.97 fps outputs. When
                                      this feature  is  enabled,  the  service
                                      will use drop-frame timecode on outputs.
                                      If it is not possible to use  drop-frame
                                      timecode,  the  system will fall back to
                                      non-drop-frame. This setting is  enabled
                                      by   default   when  Timecode  insertion
                                      (TimecodeInsertion) is enabled.

                                      ing(AfdSignaling)  to Fixed (FIXED). Use
                                      Fixed (FixedAfd) to specify  a  four-bit
                                      AFD  value  which the service will write
                                      on all frames of this video output.

                                   Height -> (integer)

                                      define  the  video resolution height for
                                      this output. Specify in pixels.  If  you
                                      don't  provide a value here, the service
                                      will use the input height.

                                   Position -> (structure)
                                      Use Selection  placement  (position)  to
                                      define  the  video  area  in your output
                                      frame. The area outside of the rectangle
                                      that you specify here is black.

                                      to have the service letterbox your video
                                      instead.  This  setting  overrides   any
                                      value  that  you specify for the setting

                                   Sharpness -> (integer)
                                      Use  Sharpness  (Sharpness)  setting  to
                                      specify the strength  of  anti-aliasing.
                                      This  setting  changes  the width of the

                                   TimecodeInsertion -> (string)
                                      Applies only to H.264, H.265, MPEG2, and
                                      ProRes  outputs.  Only  enable  Timecode
                                      insertion  when  the input frame rate is
                                      identical to the output frame  rate.  To
                                      include  timecodes  in  this output, set
                                      Timecode insertion  (VideoTimecodeInser-
                                      tion)  to  PIC_TIMING_SEI. To leave them
                                      out, set it to DISABLED. Default is DIS-
                                      ABLED.  When  the  service inserts time-
                                      codes in an output, by default, it  uses
                                      any  embedded  timecodes from the input.
                                      If none are present,  the  service  will
                                      set  the  timecode  for the first output
                                      frame to zero. To  change  this  default
                                      behavior,   adjust  the  settings  under
                                      Timecode configuration (TimecodeConfig).

                                          Position -> (string)
                                             Use   Position  (Position)  under
                                             under Timecode burn-in (Timecode-

                                          Prefix -> (string)
                                             Use   Prefix  (Prefix)  to  place
                                             ASCII   characters   before   any
                                             burned-in  timecode. For example,
                                             a prefix of "EZ-" will result  in
                                             the   timecode  "EZ-00:00:00:00".
                                             Provide  either  the   characters
                                             themselves   or  the  ASCII  code
                                             equivalents. The supported  range
                                             of  characters  is  0x20  through
                                             0x7e. This includes letters, num-
                                             bers,  and all special characters
                                             represented on a standard English
                                             keyboard.

                                   Width -> (integer)
                                      Use  Width  (Width)  to define the video
                                      resolution width, in  pixels,  for  this
                                      output.  If  you  don't  provide a value
                                      here, the service  will  use  the  input
                                      width.

                 TimecodeConfig -> (structure)
                     These  settings control how the service handles timecodes
                     throughout the job. These  settings  don't  affect  input
                     clipping.

                     Anchor -> (string)
                        If  you  use  an  editing  platform  that relies on an
                        anchor timecode, use Anchor Timecode (Anchor) to spec-
                        ify  a  timecode that will match the input video frame
                        to the output video frame.  Use  24-hour  format  with
                        frame  number,  (HH:MM:SS:FF)  or  (HH:MM:SS;FF). This
                        setting ignores frame rate conversion. System behavior
                        for  Anchor  Timecode varies depending on your setting
                        for Source (TimecodeSource). * If  Source  (TimecodeS-
                        ource) is set to Specified Start (SPECIFIEDSTART), the
                        first input frame is  the  specified  value  in  Start
                        Timecode  (Start).  Anchor Timecode (Anchor) and Start
                        Timecode (Start) are used calculate output timecode. *
                        If  Source (TimecodeSource) is set to Start at 0 (ZER-
                        OBASED) the first frame is 00:00:00:00.  *  If  Source
                        (TimecodeSource)  is  set  to Embedded (EMBEDDED), the
                        first frame is the timecode value on the  first  input
                        frame of the input.

                     Source -> (string)
                        Use  Source  (TimecodeSource) to set how timecodes are
                        handled within this job. To make sure that your video,
                        audio, captions, and markers are synchronized and that
                        time-based features, such as image inserter, work cor-
                        rectly, choose the Timecode source option that matches
                        your assets. All timecodes are  in  a  24-hour  format
                        with frame number (HH:MM:SS:FF). * Embedded (EMBEDDED)
                        - Use the timecode that is in the input video.  If  no
                        embedded  timecode  is in the source, the service will
                        use Start at 0 (ZEROBASED) instead. * Start at 0 (ZER-
                        OBASED)  -  Set  the  timecode of the initial frame to
                        00:00:00:00. * Specified Start (SPECIFIEDSTART) -  Set
                        the  timecode  of  the  initial frame to a value other
                        than zero. You use Start timecode (Start)  to  provide
                        this value.

                     Start -> (string)
                        Only use when you set Source (TimecodeSource) to Spec-
                        ified  start  (SPECIFIEDSTART).  Use  Start   timecode
                        (Start) to specify the timecode for the initial frame.
                        Use 24-hour format with frame number, (HH:MM:SS:FF) or
                        (HH:MM:SS;FF).

                     TimestampOffset -> (string)
                        Only applies to outputs that support program-date-time
                        stamp. Use Timestamp offset (TimestampOffset) to over-
                        write the timecode date without affecting the time and
                        frame number. Provide the new date as a string in  the
                        format  "yyyy-mm-dd".  To  use  Time stamp offset, you
                        must also enable Insert program-date-time  (InsertPro-
                        gramDateTime)  in the output settings. For example, if
                        the date part of your timecodes is 2002-1-25  and  you
                        want  to  change  it  to one year later, set Timestamp
                        offset (TimestampOffset) to 2003-1-25.

                 TimedMetadataInsertion -> (structure)
                     Enable Timed metadata insertion  (TimedMetadataInsertion)
                     to  include ID3 tags in any HLS outputs. To include timed
                     metadata, you must enable it here, enable it in each out-
                     put  container,  and  specify  tags  and timecodes in ID3
                     insertion (Id3Insertion) objects.

                     Id3Insertions -> (list)
                        Id3Insertions  contains  the  array  of   Id3Insertion
                        instances.

                        (structure)
                            To  insert  ID3  tags  in your output, specify two
                            values. Use ID3 tag (Id3) to specify the  base  64
                            encoded  string  and  use  Timecode  (TimeCode) to
                            specify the time when the tag should be  inserted.
                            To insert multiple ID3 tags in your output, create
                            multiple instances  of  ID3  insertion  (Id3Inser-
                            tion).

                            Id3 -> (string)
                               Use  ID3  tag  (Id3)  to provide a tag value in
                               base64-encode format.

                            Timecode -> (string)
                               Provide a Timecode (TimeCode) in HH:MM:SS:FF or
                               HH:MM:SS;FF format.

              StatusUpdateInterval -> (string)
                 Specify  how often MediaConvert sends STATUS_UPDATE events to
                 Amazon CloudWatch  Events.  Set  the  interval,  in  seconds,
                 between  status updates. MediaConvert sends an update at this
                 interval from the time the service begins processing your job
                 to  the  time  it  completes  the  transcode or encounters an
                 error.

              Type -> (string)
