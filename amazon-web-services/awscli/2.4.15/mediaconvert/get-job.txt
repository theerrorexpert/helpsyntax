GET-JOB()                                                            GET-JOB()



NAME
       get-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieve the JSON for a specific completed transcoding job.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-job
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string) the job ID of the job.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get details for a particular job

       The  following  example  requests  the  information for the job with ID
       1234567890987-1ab2c3, which in this example ended in an error.

          aws mediaconvert get-job \
              --endpoint-url https://abcd1234.mediaconvert.region-name-1.amazonaws.com \
              --region region-name-1 \
              --id 1234567890987-1ab2c3

       To get your account-specific endpoint, use describe-endpoints, or  send
       the command without the endpoint. The service returns an error and your
       endpoint.

       If your request is successful, the service returns a JSON file with job
       information, including job settings, any returned errors, and other job
       data, as follows:

          {
              "Job": {
                  "Status": "ERROR",
                  "Queue": "arn:aws:mediaconvert:region-name-1:012345678998:queues/Queue1",
                  "Settings": {
                      ...<truncated for brevity>...
                  },
                  "ErrorMessage": "Unable to open input file [s3://my-input-bucket/file-name.mp4]: [Failed probe/open: [Failed to read data: AssumeRole failed]]",
                  "ErrorCode": 1434,

OUTPUT
       Job -> (structure)
          Each  job  converts  an input file into an output file or files. For
          more     information,      see      the      User      Guide      at
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/what-is.html

          AccelerationSettings -> (structure)
              Accelerated  transcoding  can  significantly  speed up jobs with
              long, visually complex content.

              Mode -> (string)
                 Specify the conditions when the service  will  run  your  job
                 with accelerated transcoding.

          AccelerationStatus -> (string)
              Describes  whether  the  current job is running with accelerated
              transcoding. For jobs that have Acceleration  (AccelerationMode)
              set  to  DISABLED,  AccelerationStatus is always NOT_APPLICABLE.
              For  jobs  that  have  Acceleration  (AccelerationMode)  set  to
              ENABLED  or  PREFERRED,  AccelerationStatus  is one of the other
              states. AccelerationStatus is IN_PROGRESS initially,  while  the
              service  determines whether the input files and job settings are
              compatible with accelerated transcoding. If they  are,  Acclera-
              tionStatus  is ACCELERATED. If your input files and job settings
              aren't compatible  with  accelerated  transcoding,  the  service
              either  fails  your job or runs it without accelerated transcod-
              ing, depending on how you set  Acceleration  (AccelerationMode).
              When  the service runs your job without accelerated transcoding,
              AccelerationStatus is NOT_ACCELERATED.

          Arn -> (string)
              An identifier for this resource that is  unique  within  all  of
              AWS.

          BillingTagsSource -> (string)
              The  tag  type  that AWS Billing and Cost Management will use to
              sort your AWS Elemental MediaConvert costs on any billing report
              that you set up.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The time, in Unix epoch format in seconds, when the job got cre-
              ated.

          CurrentPhase -> (string)
              A job's phase can be PROBING, TRANSCODING OR UPLOADING

          ErrorCode -> (integer)
              Error code for the job

          ErrorMessage -> (string)
              Error message of Job

          HopDestinations -> (list)
              Optional list of hop destinations.

              (structure)
                 Optional. Configuration for a destination queue to which  the
                 job  can  hop  once  a customer-defined minimum wait time has
                 passed.

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     Optional. When you set up a job to use queue hopping, you
                     can  specify a different relative priority for the job in
                     the destination queue. If you don't specify, the relative
                     priority will remain the same as in the previous queue.

                 Queue -> (string)
                     Optional  unless  the  job  is  submitted  on the default
                     queue. When you set up a job to use  queue  hopping,  you
                     can specify a destination queue. This queue cannot be the
                     original queue to which the  job  is  submitted.  If  the
                     original  queue  isn't  the  default  queue and you don't
                     specify the destination queue, the job will move  to  the
                     default queue.

                 WaitMinutes -> (integer)
                     Required for setting up a job to use queue hopping. Mini-
                     mum wait time in minutes until the job  can  hop  to  the
                     destination  queue.  Valid  range  is  1 to 1440 minutes,
                     inclusive.

          Id -> (string)
              A portion of the job's ARN, unique  within  your  AWS  Elemental
              MediaConvert resources

          JobPercentComplete -> (integer)
              An estimate of how far your job has progressed. This estimate is
              shown as a percentage of the  total  time  from  when  your  job
              leaves its queue to when your output files appear in your output
              Amazon S3 bucket. AWS Elemental  MediaConvert  provides  jobPer-
              centComplete  in  CloudWatch  STATUS_UPDATE  events  and  in the
              response to GetJob and ListJobs requests. The jobPercentComplete
              estimate  is reliable for the following input containers: Quick-
              time, Transport Stream, MP4, and MXF. For some jobs, the service
              can't  provide  information  about job progress. In those cases,
              jobPercentComplete returns a null value.

          JobTemplate -> (string)
              The job template that the job is created from, if it is  created
              from a job template.

          Messages -> (structure)
              Provides  messages  from  the  service  about jobs that you have
              already successfully submitted.

              you don't specify, the job will go to  the  default  queue.  For
              more    about    queues,   see   the   User   Guide   topic   at
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/what-is.html

                 input Ad Avail PTS time.

              AvailBlanking -> (structure)
                 Settings for ad avail blanking. Video can be blanked or over-
                 laid  with an image, and audio muted during SCTE-35 triggered
                 ad avails.

                 AvailBlankingImage -> (string)
                     Blanking image to be used. Leave empty for  solid  black.
                     Only bmp and png images are supported.

              Esam -> (structure)
                 Settings  for  Event  Signaling  And Messaging (ESAM). If you
                 don't do ad insertion, you can ignore these settings.

                 ManifestConfirmConditionNotification -> (structure)
                     Specifies  an  ESAM  ManifestConfirmConditionNotification
                     XML as per OC-SP-ESAM-API-I03-131025. The transcoder uses
                     the manifest conditioning instructions that  you  provide
                     in the setting MCC XML (mccXml).

                     MccXml -> (string)
                        Provide your ESAM ManifestConfirmConditionNotification
                        XML document inside your JSON job settings.  Form  the
                        XML  document  as  per  OC-SP-ESAM-API-I03-131025. The
                        transcoder will use the Manifest Conditioning instruc-
                        tions in the message that you supply.

                 ResponseSignalPreroll -> (integer)
                     Specifies  the  stream distance, in milliseconds, between
                     the SCTE 35 messages that the transcoder places  and  the
                     splice points that they refer to. If the time between the
                     start of the asset and the SCTE-35 message is  less  than
                     this value, then the transcoder places the SCTE-35 marker
                     at the beginning of the stream.

                 SignalProcessingNotification -> (structure)
                     Specifies an ESAM SignalProcessingNotification XML as per
                     OC-SP-ESAM-API-I03-131025. The transcoder uses the signal
                     processing instructions that you provide in  the  setting
                     SCC XML (sccXml).

                     SccXml -> (string)
                        Provide  your  ESAM  SignalProcessingNotification  XML
                        document inside your JSON job settings. Form  the  XML
                        document   as   per   OC-SP-ESAM-API-I03-131025.   The
                        transcoder will use the signal processing instructions
                        in the message that you supply. Provide your ESAM Sig-
                        nalProcessingNotification  XML  document  inside  your
                        JSON  job settings. For your MPEG2-TS file outputs, if
                        you want the service to place SCTE-35 markers  at  the
                        insertion  points you specify in the XML document, you
                        must also enable SCTE-35 ESAM (scte35Esam). Note  that
                        you  can either specify an ESAM XML document or enable
                        SCTE-35 passthrough. You can't do both.

              ExtendedDataServices -> (structure)
                 If your source content has EIA-608  Line  21  Data  Services,
                 enable  this  feature  to specify what MediaConvert does with
                 the Extended Data Services (XDS) packets. You can  choose  to
                 pass through XDS packets, or remove them from the output. For
                 more information about XDS, see EIA-608 Line  Data  Services,
                 section 9.5.1.5 05h Content Advisory.

                 CopyProtectionAction -> (string)
                     The action to take on copy and redistribution control XDS
                     packets. If you select PASSTHROUGH, packets will  not  be
                     changed. If you select STRIP, any packets will be removed
                     in output captions.

                 VchipAction -> (string)
                     The action to take on content advisory  XDS  packets.  If
                     you  select  PASSTHROUGH, packets will not be changed. If
                     you select STRIP, any packets will be removed  in  output
                     captions.

              Inputs -> (list)
                 Use  Inputs  (inputs)  to  define  source  file  used  in the
                 transcode job. There can be multiple inputs  add  in  a  job.
                 These  inputs  will  be  concantenated together to create the
                 output.

                 (structure)
                     Use inputs to  define  the  source  files  used  in  your
                     transcoding    job.    For    more    information,    see
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/specify-input-settings.html.
                     You  can use multiple video inputs to do input stitching.

                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/assembling-multiple-inputs-and-input-clips.html

                     AudioSelectorGroups -> (map)
                        Use audio selector groups to combine multiple  sidecar
                        audio  inputs  so that you can assign them to a single
                        output audio tab  (AudioDescription).  Note  that,  if
                        you're  working  with  embedded audio, it's simpler to
                        assign multiple  input  tracks  into  a  single  audio
                        selector rather than use an audio selector group.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (structure)
                            Use  audio  selector  groups  to  combine multiple
                            sidecar audio inputs so that you can  assign  them
                            to  a  single output audio tab (AudioDescription).
                            Note that, if you're working with embedded  audio,
                            it's  simpler to assign multiple input tracks into
                            a single audio selector rather than use  an  audio
                            selector group.

                            AudioSelectorNames -> (list)
                               Name of an Audio Selector within the same input
                               to include in the group. Audio  selector  names
                               are  standardized,  based on their order within
                               the input (e.g., "Audio Selector 1"). The audio
                               selector  name parameter can be repeated to add
                               any number of audio selectors to the group.

                               (string)

                     AudioSelectors -> (map)
                        Use Audio  selectors  (AudioSelectors)  to  specify  a
                        track  or  set  of tracks from the input that you will
                        use in your outputs. You can use multiple Audio selec-
                        tors per input.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (structure)
                            Use  Audio selectors (AudioSelectors) to specify a
                            track or set of tracks from  the  input  that  you
                            will  use  in  your  outputs. You can use multiple
                            Audio selectors per input.

                            CustomLanguageCode -> (string)
                               Selects a specific language code from within an
                               audio  source, using the ISO 639-2 or ISO 639-3
                               three-letter language code

                            DefaultSelection -> (string)
                               Enable this setting on one  audio  selector  to
                               set  it as the default for the job. The service
                               uses this default for outputs  where  it  can't
                               find  the  specified  input audio. If you don't
                               set a default, those outputs have no audio.

                            ExternalAudioFileInput -> (string)
                               Specifies audio  data  from  an  external  file
                               source.

                            HlsRenditionGroupSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings  specific  to  audio sources in an HLS
                               alternate rendition group. Specify the  proper-
                               ties (renditionGroupId, renditionName or rendi-
                               tionLanguageCode) to identify the unique  audio
                               track  among  the  alternative rendition groups
                               present in the HLS manifest. If no unique track
                               is  found, or multiple tracks match the proper-
                               ties provided, the job fails. If no  properties
                               in hlsRenditionGroupSettings are specified, the
                               default audio track within the video segment is
                               chosen.  If there is no audio within video seg-
                               ment, the alternative audio with DEFAULT=YES is
                               chosen instead.

                               RenditionGroupId -> (string)
                                   Optional. Specify alternative group ID

                               RenditionLanguageCode -> (string)
                                   Optional.  Specify  ISO  639-2 or ISO 639-3
                                   code in the language property

                               RenditionName -> (string)
                                   Optional. Specify media name

                            LanguageCode -> (string)
                               Selects a specific language code from within an
                               audio source.

                            Offset -> (integer)
                               Specifies  a time delta in milliseconds to off-
                               set the audio from the input video.

                            Pids -> (list)
                               Selects a specific PID  from  within  an  audio
                               source (e.g. 257 selects PID 0x101).

                               (integer)

                            ProgramSelection -> (integer)
                               Use this setting for input streams that contain
                               Dolby E, to have the service  extract  specific
                               program data from the track. To select multiple
                               programs, create multiple  selectors  with  the
                               same  Track  and  different Program numbers. In
                               the console, this setting is visible  when  you
                               set  Selector type to Track. Choose the program
                               number from the dropdown list. If you are send-
                               ing  a JSON file, provide the program ID, which
                               is part of the audio metadata.  If  your  input
                               file has incorrect metadata, you can choose All
                               channels instead of a program  number  to  have
                               the  service ignore the program IDs and include
                               all the programs in the track.

                            RemixSettings -> (structure)
                               Use these settings to reorder the  audio  chan-
                               nels  of  one  input  to match those of another
                               input. This allows you to combine the two files
                               into a single output, one after the other.

                               ChannelMapping -> (structure)
                                   Channel  mapping  (ChannelMapping) contains
                                   the group of fields that hold the  remixing
                                   value  for  each  channel,  in  dB. Specify
                                   remix values to indicate how  much  of  the
                                   content  from  your input audio channel you
                                   want in your output  audio  channels.  Each
                                   instance of the InputChannels or InputChan-
                                   nelsFineTune array specifies  these  values
                                   for one output channel. Use one instance of
                                   this array for each output channel. In  the
                                   console, each array corresponds to a column
                                   in the graphical depiction of  the  mapping
                                   matrix.  The  rows  of the graphical matrix
                                   correspond to input channels. Valid  values
                                   are   within  the  range  from  -60  (mute)
                                   through 6. A setting of 0 passes the  input
                                   channel unchanged to the output channel (no
                                   attenuation    or    amplification).    Use
                                   InputChannels  or  InputChannelsFineTune to
                                   specify your remix values. Don't use  both.

                                   OutputChannels -> (list)
                                      In  your JSON job specification, include
                                      one child  of  OutputChannels  for  each
                                      audio channel that you want in your out-
                                      put.  Each  child  should  contain   one
                                      instance  of InputChannels or InputChan-
                                      nelsFineTune.

                                      (structure)
                                          OutputChannel mapping settings.

                                          InputChannels -> (list)
                                             Use this setting to specify  your
                                             remix  values when they are inte-
                                             gers, such as -10, 0, or 4.

                                             (integer)

                                          InputChannelsFineTune -> (list)
                                             Use this setting to specify  your
                                             remix  values  when  they  have a
                                             decimal   component,   such    as
                                             -10.312,  0.08, or 4.9. MediaCon-
                                             vert rounds your remixing  values
                                             to the nearest thousandth.

                                             (double)

                               ChannelsIn -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the  number of audio channels from
                                   your input that you want  to  use  in  your
                                   output. With remixing, you might combine or
                                   split the data in these  channels,  so  the
                                   number  of  channels  in  your final output
                                   might be different. If you are  doing  both
                                   input  channel  mapping  and output channel
                                   mapping, the number of output  channels  in
                                   your  input mapping must be the same as the
                                   number of input  channels  in  your  output
                                   mapping.

                               ChannelsOut -> (integer)
                                   Specify the number of channels in this out-
                                   put after remixing. Valid values: 1, 2,  4,
                                   6,  8... 64. (1 and even numbers to 64.) If
                                   you are doing both  input  channel  mapping
                                   and  output  channel mapping, the number of
                                   output channels in your input mapping  must
                                   be the same as the number of input channels
                                   in your output mapping.

                            SelectorType -> (string)
                               Specifies the type of the audio selector.

                            Tracks -> (list)
                               Identify  a  track  from  the  input  audio  to
                               include  in this selector by entering the track
                               index number. To include several  tracks  in  a
                               single  audio selector, specify multiple tracks
                               as  follows.  Using  the   console,   enter   a
                               comma-separated  list. For examle, type "1,2,3"
                               to  include  tracks  1  through  3.  Specifying
                               directly  in  your  JSON  job file, provide the
                               track  numbers  in  an  array.   For   example,
                               "tracks": [1,2,3].

                               (integer)

                     CaptionSelectors -> (map)
                        Use  captions  selectors  to specify the captions data
                        from your input that you use in your outputs. You  can
                        use up to 20 captions selectors per input.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (structure)
                            Use  captions  selectors  to  specify the captions
                            data from your input that you use in your outputs.
                            You can use up to 20 captions selectors per input.

                            CustomLanguageCode -> (string)
                               The specific language to extract  from  source,
                               using  the  ISO 639-2 or ISO 639-3 three-letter
                               language code. If input  is  SCTE-27,  complete
                               this  field  and/or  PID  to select the caption

                                      uses seconds by default.

                               SourceType -> (string)
                                   Use  Source  (SourceType)  to  identify the
                                   format of your input captions. The  service
                                   cannot auto-detect caption format.

                               TeletextSourceSettings -> (structure)
                                   Settings   specific   to  Teletext  caption
                                   sources, including Page number.

                                   PageNumber -> (string)
                                      Use Page Number (PageNumber) to  specify
                                      the  three-digit hexadecimal page number
                                      that will be used for Teletext captions.
                                      Do not use this setting if you are pass-
                                      ing  through  teletext  from  the  input
                                      source to output.

                               TrackSourceSettings -> (structure)
                                   Settings  specific  to caption sources that
                                   are specified by track  number.  Currently,
                                   this  is only IMSC captions in an IMF pack-
                                   age. If your caption source is IMSC 1.1  in
                                   a separate xml file, use FileSourceSettings
                                   instead of TrackSourceSettings.

                                   TrackNumber -> (integer)
                                      Use this setting to select a single cap-
                                      tions track from a source. Track numbers
                                      correspond to the order in the  captions
                                      source file. For IMF sources, track num-
                                      bering is based on the  order  that  the
                                      captions appear in the CPL. For example,
                                      use 1 to select the captions asset  that
                                      is  listed  first in the CPL. To include
                                      more than one captions track in your job
                                      outputs,  create multiple input captions
                                      selectors. Specify one track per  selec-
                                      tor.

                               WebvttHlsSourceSettings -> (structure)
                                   Settings  specific to WebVTT sources in HLS
                                   alternative rendition  group.  Specify  the
                                   properties (renditionGroupId, renditionName
                                   or renditionLanguageCode) to  identify  the
                                   unique subtitle track among the alternative
                                   rendition groups present in the  HLS  mani-
                                   fest.  If no unique track is found, or mul-
                                   tiple tracks match  the  specified  proper-
                                   ties,  the  job fails. If there is only one
                                   subtitle track in the rendition group,  the
                                   settings  can be left empty and the default
                                   subtitle track will be chosen. If your cap-
                                   tion  source  is  a sidecar file, use File-
                                   SourceSettings instead of  WebvttHlsSource-
                                   Settings.

                                   RenditionGroupId -> (string)
                                      Optional. Specify alternative group ID

                                   RenditionName -> (string)
                                      Optional. Specify media name

                     Crop -> (structure)
                        Use Cropping selection (crop)  to  specify  the  video
                        area that the service will include in the output video
                        frame. If you specify a value here, it  will  override
                        any value that you specify in the output setting Crop-
                        ping selection (crop).

                        Height -> (integer)
                            Height of rectangle in pixels. Specify  only  even
                            numbers.

                        Width -> (integer)
                            Width  of  rectangle  in pixels. Specify only even
                            numbers.

                        X -> (integer)
                            The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and
                            the  left  edge  of  the video frame. Specify only
                            even numbers.

                        Y -> (integer)
                            The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and
                            the top edge of the video frame. Specify only even
                            numbers.

                     DeblockFilter -> (string)
                        Enable   Deblock   (InputDeblockFilter)   to   produce
                        smoother  motion  in  the output. Default is disabled.
                        Only manually controllable for MPEG2 and  uncompressed
                        video inputs.

                     DecryptionSettings -> (structure)
                        Settings  for  decrypting  any  input  files  that you
                        encrypt before you upload them to Amazon S3. MediaCon-
                        vert  can decrypt files only when you use AWS Key Man-
                        agement Service (KMS) to encrypt the data key that you
                        use to encrypt your content.

                        DecryptionMode -> (string)
                            Specify  the  encryption  mode  that  you  used to
                            encrypt your input files.

                        EncryptedDecryptionKey -> (string)
                            Warning! Don't  provide  your  encryption  key  in
                            plaintext. Your job settings could be intercepted,
                            making your encrypted content vulnerable.  Specify
                            the  encrypted  version  of  the data key that you
                            used to encrypt your content. The data key must be
                            encrypted by AWS Key Management Service (KMS). The
                            key can be 128, 192, or 256 bits.

                        InitializationVector -> (string)
                            Specify the initialization vector  that  you  used
                            when  you  encrypted your content before uploading
                            it to Amazon S3. You can use a 16-byte initializa-
                            tion  vector with any encryption mode. Or, you can
                            use a 12-byte initialization vector  with  GCM  or
                            CTR. MediaConvert accepts only initialization vec-
                            tors that are base64-encoded.

                        KmsKeyRegion -> (string)
                            Specify the AWS Region for AWS Key Management Ser-
                            vice (KMS) that you used to encrypt your data key,
                            if that Region is different from the one  you  are
                            using for AWS Elemental MediaConvert.

                     DenoiseFilter -> (string)
                        Enable  Denoise  (InputDenoiseFilter)  to filter noise
                        from the input. Default is disabled.  Only  applicable
                        to MPEG2, H.264, H.265, and uncompressed video inputs.

                     DolbyVisionMetadataXml -> (string)
                        Use this setting only when your video source has Dolby
                        Vision  studio mastering metadata that is carried in a
                        separate XML file. Specify the Amazon S3 location  for
                        the  metadata XML file. MediaConvert uses this file to
                        provide global  and  frame-level  metadata  for  Dolby
                        Vision preprocessing. When you specify a file here and
                        your input also has interleaved global and frame level
                        metadata,  MediaConvert  ignores the interleaved meta-
                        data and uses only the the metadata from this external
                        XML  file.  Note that your IAM service role must grant
                        MediaConvert read permissions to this file.  For  more
                        information,                                       see

                     FileInput -> (string)
                        Specify  the source file for your transcoding job. You
                        can use multiple inputs in a single job.  The  service
                        concatenates these inputs, in the order that you spec-
                        ify them in the job, to create the  outputs.  If  your
                        input  format  is IMF, specify your input by providing
                        the    path    to    your    CPL.     For     example,
                        "s3://bucket/vf/cpl.xml".  If  the CPL is in an incom-
                        plete IMP, make sure to use Supplemental IMPs (Supple-
                        mentalImps) to specify any supplemental IMPs that con-
                        tain assets referenced by the CPL.

                     FilterEnable -> (string)
                        Specify  how  the  transcoding  service  applies   the
                        denoise  and deblock filters. You must also enable the
                        filters separately, with Denoise  (InputDenoiseFilter)
                        and   Deblock   (InputDeblockFilter).  *  Auto  -  The
                        transcoding service determines whether to  apply  fil-
                        tering, depending on input type and quality. * Disable
                        - The input is not filtered. This is true even if  you
                        use the API to enable them in (InputDeblockFilter) and
                        (InputDeblockFilter). * Force - The input is  filtered
                        regardless of input type.

                     FilterStrength -> (integer)
                        Use  Filter  strength  (FilterStrength)  to adjust the
                        magnitude  the  input  filter  settings  (Deblock  and
                        Denoise). The range is -5 to 5. Default is 0.

                     ImageInserter -> (structure)
                        Enable the image inserter feature to include a graphic
                        overlay on your video. Enable or disable this  feature
                        for  each input individually. This setting is disabled
                        by default.

                        InsertableImages -> (list)
                            Specify the images that you  want  to  overlay  on
                            your video. The images must be PNG or TGA files.

                            (structure)
                               These  settings  apply  to  a  specific graphic
                               overlay. You can include multiple  overlays  in
                               your job.

                               Duration -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the time, in milliseconds, for the
                                   image to remain on the output  video.  This
                                   duration  includes  fade-in  time  but  not
                                   fade-out time.

                               FadeIn -> (integer)
                                   Specify the length of  time,  in  millisec-
                                   onds, between the Start time that you spec-
                                   ify for the image insertion  and  the  time
                                   that  the  image  appears  at full opacity.
                                   Full opacity is the level that you  specify
                                   for the opacity setting. If you don't spec-
                                   ify a value for  Fade-in,  the  image  will
                                   appear  abruptly at the overlay start time.

                               FadeOut -> (integer)
                                   Specify the length of  time,  in  millisec-
                                   onds,  between the end of the time that you
                                   have specified for the image overlay  Dura-
                                   tion  and when the overlaid image has faded
                                   to total transparency. If you don't specify
                                   a value for Fade-out, the image will disap-
                                   pear abruptly at the end  of  the  inserted
                                   image duration.

                               Height -> (integer)
                                   Specify the height of the inserted image in
                                   pixels.  If  you  specify  a  value  that's
                                   larger  than  the  video resolution height,
                                   the service will crop your  overlaid  image
                                   to  fit.  To  use  the native height of the
                                   image, keep this setting blank.

                               ImageInserterInput -> (string)
                                   Specify the HTTP, HTTPS, or Amazon S3 loca-
                                   tion  of the image that you want to overlay
                                   on the video. Use a PNG or TGA file.

                               ImageX -> (integer)
                                   Specify the distance,  in  pixels,  between
                                   the inserted image and the left edge of the
                                   video frame. Required for any image overlay
                                   that you specify.

                               ImageY -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the  distance,  in pixels, between
                                   the overlaid image and the top edge of  the
                                   video frame. Required for any image overlay
                                   that you specify.

                               Layer -> (integer)
                                   Specify  how  overlapping  inserted  images
                                   appear. Images with higher values for Layer
                                   appear on top of images with  lower  values
                                   for Layer.

                               Opacity -> (integer)
                                   Use  Opacity  (Opacity) to specify how much
                                   of the underlying video shows  through  the
                                   inserted image. 0 is transparent and 100 is
                                   fully opaque. Default is 50.

                               StartTime -> (string)
                                   Specify the timecode of the frame that  you
                                   want  the  overlay to first appear on. This
                                   must  be  in   timecode   (HH:MM:SS:FF   or
                                   HH:MM:SS;FF)  format. Remember to take into
                                   account your timecode source settings.

                               Width -> (integer)
                                   Specify the width of the inserted image  in
                                   pixels.  If  you  specify  a  value  that's
                                   larger than the video resolution width, the
                                   service  will  crop  your overlaid image to
                                   fit. To use the native width of the  image,
                                   keep this setting blank.

                     InputClippings -> (list)
                        (InputClippings)  contains sets of start and end times
                        that together specify a portion of  the  input  to  be
                        used in the outputs. If you provide only a start time,
                        the clip will be the entire input from that  point  to
                        the  end.  If you provide only an end time, it will be
                        the entire input up to that point.  When  you  specify
                        more than one input clip, the transcoding service cre-
                        ates the job outputs by stringing the  clips  together
                        in the order you specify them.

                        (structure)
                            To  transcode only portions of your input, include
                            one input clip for each part of  your  input  that
                            you  want in your output. All input clips that you
                            specify will be included in every  output  of  the
                            job.      For      more      information,      see
                            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/assembling-multiple-inputs-and-input-clips.html.

                            EndTimecode -> (string)
                               Set  End  timecode  (EndTimecode) to the end of
                               the portion of the input you are clipping.  The
                               frame  corresponding  to the End timecode value
                               is included in the clip. Start timecode or  End
                               timecode  may  be left blank, but not both. Use
                               the format HH:MM:SS:FF or HH:MM:SS;FF, where HH
                               is  the  hour, MM is the minute, SS is the sec-
                               ond, and FF is the frame number. When  choosing
                               this  value, take into account your setting for
                               timecode source under  input  settings  (Input-
                               TimecodeSource).   For  example,  if  you  have
                               embedded timecodes that  start  at  01:00:00:00
                               and  you want your clip to end six minutes into
                               the video, use 01:06:00:00.

                            StartTimecode -> (string)
                               Set  Start  timecode  (StartTimecode)  to   the
                               beginning  of  the portion of the input you are
                               clipping. The frame corresponding to the  Start
                               timecode  value  is included in the clip. Start
                               timecode or End timecode may be left blank, but
                               not   both.   Use  the  format  HH:MM:SS:FF  or
                               HH:MM:SS;FF, where HH is the hour,  MM  is  the
                               minute,  SS  is the second, and FF is the frame
                               number. When choosing  this  value,  take  into
                               account your setting for Input timecode source.
                               For example, if  you  have  embedded  timecodes
                               that  start  at  01:00:00:00  and you want your
                               clip to begin five minutes into the video,  use
                               01:05:00:00.

                     InputScanType -> (string)
                        When  you  have  a  progressive  segmented frame (PsF)
                        input, use this setting to  flag  the  input  as  PsF.
                        MediaConvert  doesn't automatically detect PsF. There-
                        fore, flagging your input as  PsF  results  in  better
                        preservation  of video quality when you do deinterlac-
                        ing and frame rate conversion. If you  don't  specify,
                        the  default value is Auto (AUTO). Auto is the correct
                        setting for all inputs that are  not  PsF.  Don't  set
                        this value to PsF when your input is interlaced. Doing
                        so creates horizontal interlacing artifacts.

                     Position -> (structure)
                        Use Selection placement (position) to define the video
                        area  in  your  output  frame. The area outside of the
                        rectangle that you specify here is black. If you spec-
                        ify  a value here, it will override any value that you
                        specify in  the  output  setting  Selection  placement
                        (position).  If  you  specify  a value here, this will
                        override any AFD values in your input, even if you set
                        Respond to AFD (RespondToAfd) to Respond (RESPOND). If
                        you specify a value here, this  will  ignore  anything
                        that  you  specify  for  the  setting Scaling Behavior
                        (scalingBehavior).

                        Height -> (integer)
                            Height of rectangle in pixels. Specify  only  even
                            numbers.

                        Width -> (integer)
                            Width  of  rectangle  in pixels. Specify only even
                            numbers.

                        X -> (integer)
                            The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and
                            the  left  edge  of  the video frame. Specify only
                            even numbers.

                        Y -> (integer)
                            The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and
                            the top edge of the video frame. Specify only even
                            numbers.

                     ProgramNumber -> (integer)
                        Use Program (programNumber) to select a specific  pro-
                        gram  from  within  a  multi-program transport stream.
                        Note that Quad 4K is not currently supported.  Default
                        is  the  first program within the transport stream. If
                        the program you specify doesn't exist, the transcoding
                        service will use this default.

                     PsiControl -> (string)
                        Set PSI control (InputPsiControl) for transport stream
                        inputs to specify which  data  the  demux  process  to
                        scans.  *  Ignore  PSI  -  Scan all PIDs for audio and
                        video. * Use PSI - Scan only PSI data.

                     SupplementalImps -> (list)
                        Provide a list of any necessary supplemental IMPs. You
                        need  supplemental  IMPs  if the CPL that you're using
                        for your input is in an incomplete IMP. Specify either
                        the supplemental IMP directories with a trailing slash
                        or    the    ASSETMAP.xml    files.    For     example
                        ["s3://bucket/ov/",   "s3://bucket/vf2/ASSETMAP.xml"].
                        You don't need to specify the IMP that  contains  your
                        input  CPL,  because the service automatically detects
                        it.

                        (string)

                     TimecodeSource -> (string)
                        Use this Timecode source setting,  located  under  the
                        input  settings  (InputTimecodeSource), to specify how
                        the service counts  input  video  frames.  This  input
                        frame count affects only the behavior of features that
                        apply to a single input at a time, such as input clip-
                        ping  and  synchronizing some captions formats. Choose
                        Embedded (EMBEDDED) to use the timecodes in your input
                        video.  Choose  Start at zero (ZEROBASED) to start the
                        first frame at zero. Choose  Specified  start  (SPECI-
                        FIEDSTART)  to  start  the first frame at the timecode
                        that you specify in the setting Start timecode  (time-
                        codeStart).  If you don't specify a value for Timecode
                        source, the service will use Embedded by default.  For
                        more      information     about     timecodes,     see
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/mediaconvert/timecode.

                     TimecodeStart -> (string)
                        Specify  the timecode that you want the service to use
                        for this input's initial frame. To use  this  setting,
                        you  must  set  the  Timecode  source setting, located
                        under the  input  settings  (InputTimecodeSource),  to
                        Specified start (SPECIFIEDSTART). For more information
                        about                  timecodes,                  see
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/mediaconvert/timecode.

                     VideoSelector -> (structure)
                        Input video selectors contain the video  settings  for
                        the  input.  Each  of  your  inputs can have up to one
                        video selector.

                        AlphaBehavior -> (string)
                            Ignore this setting unless this input is a  Quick-
                            Time  animation  with  an  alpha channel. Use this
                            setting to create separate Key and  Fill  outputs.
                            In  each  output,  specify which part of the input
                            MediaConvert  uses.  Leave  this  setting  at  the
                            default  value DISCARD to delete the alpha channel
                            and preserve the video. Set it to REMAP_TO_LUMA to
                            delete  the video and map the alpha channel to the
                            luma channel of your outputs.

                        ColorSpace -> (string)
                            If your input video has accurate color space meta-
                            data,  or  if  you  don't  know about color space,
                            leave this set to the default value  Follow  (FOL-
                            LOW).  The  service will automatically detect your
                            input color space. If your input video  has  meta-
                            data indicating the wrong color space, specify the
                            accurate color space here. If your input video  is
                            HDR  10  and  the  SMPTE ST 2086 Mastering Display
                            Color Volume static metadata isn't present in your
                            video  stream,  or if that metadata is present but
                            not accurate, choose Force  HDR  10  (FORCE_HDR10)
                            here  and  specify correct values in the input HDR

                        ColorSpaceUsage -> (string)
                            There  are  two  sources  for  color metadata, the
                            input file and the job input settings Color  space
                            (ColorSpace)  and  HDR  master display information
                            settings(Hdr10Metadata).  The  Color  space  usage
                            setting  determines which takes precedence. Choose
                            Force (FORCE) to use color metadata from the input
                            job  settings.  If  you  don't  specify values for
                            those settings,  the  service  defaults  to  using
                            metadata  from your input. FALLBACK - Choose Fall-
                            back (FALLBACK) to use  color  metadata  from  the
                            source  when  it  is  present. If there's no color
                            metadata in your input file, the service  defaults
                            to using values you specify in the input settings.

                        Hdr10Metadata -> (structure)
                            Use these settings to provide HDR 10 metadata that
                            is  missing  or  inaccurate  in  your input video.
                            Appropriate values vary  depending  on  the  input
                            video  and must be provided by a color grader. The
                            color grader generates these values during the HDR
                            10  mastering process. The valid range for each of
                            these settings is 0 to 50,000. Each increment rep-
                            resents   0.00002  in  CIE1931  color  coordinate.
                            Related settings - When you specify these  values,
                            you  must also set Color space (ColorSpace) to HDR
                            10 (HDR10). To specify whether the the values  you
                            specify  here  take  precedence over the values in
                            the metadata of your input file, set  Color  space
                            usage  (ColorSpaceUsage). To specify whether color
                            metadata is included in an output, set Color meta-
                            data  (ColorMetadata).  For more information about

                            WhitePointY -> (integer)
                               HDR Master Display Information must be provided
                               by  a  color grader, using color grading tools.

                        Pid -> (integer)
                            Use PID (Pid) to select specific video  data  from
                            an  input  file. Specify this value as an integer;
                            the system automatically converts it to  the  hex-
                            idecimal  value.  For  example,  257  selects  PID
                            0x101. A PID, or packet identifier, is an  identi-
                            fier  for  a  set  of  data in an MPEG-2 transport
                            stream container.

                        ProgramNumber -> (integer)
                            Selects  a  specific   program   from   within   a
                            multi-program  transport stream. Note that Quad 4K
                            is not currently supported.

                        Rotate -> (string)
                            Use Rotate (InputRotate) to specify how  the  ser-
                            vice  rotates your video. You can choose automatic
                            rotation or specify a rotation. You can specify  a
                            clockwise  rotation of 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees.
                            If your input video container is .mov or .mp4  and
                            your  input  has rotation metadata, you can choose
                            Automatic to have the service  rotate  your  video
                            according  to  the rotation specified in the meta-
                            data. The rotation must be within  one  degree  of
                            90,  180, or 270 degrees. If the rotation metadata
                            specifies any other  rotation,  the  service  will
                            default  to  no  rotation. By default, the service
                            does no rotation, even if  your  input  video  has
                            rotation   metadata.   The  service  doesn't  pass
                            through rotation metadata.

                        SampleRange -> (string)
                            If the sample range metadata in your  input  video
                            is  accurate,  or  if  you don't know about sample
                            range, keep the default  value,  Follow  (FOLLOW),
                            for  this  setting. When you do, the service auto-
                            matically detects your input sample range. If your
                            input video has metadata indicating the wrong sam-
                            ple range, specify the accurate sample range here.
                            When you do, MediaConvert ignores any sample range
                            information in the input metadata.  Regardless  of
                            whether  MediaConvert  uses the input sample range
                            or the sample range that you specify, MediaConvert
                            uses  the  sample  range  for transcoding and also
                            writes it to the output metadata.

              KantarWatermark -> (structure)
                 Use these settings only when  you  use  Kantar  watermarking.
                 Specify  the  values  that  MediaConvert uses to generate and
                 place Kantar watermarks in your output audio. These  settings
                 apply  to every output in your job. In addition to specifying
                 these values, you also need to store your Kantar  credentials
                 in   AWS   Secrets   Manager.   For   more  information,  see
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/kantar-watermarking.html.

                 ChannelName -> (string)
                     Provide  an  audio  channel  name  from your Kantar audio
                     license.

                 ContentReference -> (string)
                     Specify a unique identifier for Kantar to  use  for  this
                     piece of content.

                 CredentialsSecretName -> (string)
                     Provide  the name of the AWS Secrets Manager secret where
                     your Kantar credentials are stored. Note that your Media-
                     Convert  service role must provide access to this secret.

                 FileOffset -> (double)
                     Optional. Specify an offset, in whole seconds,  from  the
                     start  of your output and the beginning of the watermark-
                     ing. When you don't specify an offset, Kantar defaults to
                     zero.

                 KantarLicenseId -> (integer)
                     Provide  your  Kantar  license  ID number. You should get
                     this number from Kantar.

                 KantarServerUrl -> (string)
                     Provide the HTTPS endpoint  to  the  Kantar  server.  You
                     should get this endpoint from Kantar.

                 LogDestination -> (string)
                     Optional.  Specify  the  Amazon  S3 bucket where you want
                     MediaConvert to store your  Kantar  watermark  XML  logs.
                     When  you  don't  specify  a bucket, MediaConvert doesn't
                     save these logs. Note that your MediaConvert service role
                     must  provide  access to this location. For more informa-
                     tion,                                                 see

                     Maximum length is 50 characters.

              MotionImageInserter -> (structure)
                 Overlay  motion  graphics  on  top  of your video. The motion
                 graphics that you specify here appear on all outputs  in  all
                 output      groups.     For     more     information,     see
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/motion-graphic-overlay.html.

                 Framerate -> (structure)
                     If  your  motion  graphic asset is a .mov file, keep this
                     setting unspecified. If your motion graphic  asset  is  a
                     series of .png files, specify the frame rate of the over-
                     lay in frames per second, as  a  fraction.  For  example,
                     specify  24  fps  as  24/1.  Make sure that the number of
                     images in your series matches the  frame  rate  and  your
                     intended  overlay  duration.  For  example, if you want a
                     30-second overlay at 30 fps, you  should  have  900  .png
                     images. This overlay frame rate doesn't need to match the
                     frame rate of the underlying video.

                     FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                        The bottom of the fraction that expresses your overlay
                        frame rate. For example, if your frame rate is 24 fps,
                        set this value to 1.

                     FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                        The top of the fraction that  expresses  your  overlay
                        frame rate. For example, if your frame rate is 24 fps,
                        set this value to 24.

                 Input -> (string)
                     Specify the .mov file or series of .png  files  that  you
                     want  to  overlay  on your video. For .png files, provide
                     the file name of the first file in the series. Make  sure
                     that the names of the .png files end with sequential num-
                     bers that specify the order that they are played in.  For
                     example,    overlay_000.png,    overlay_001.png,    over-
                     lay_002.png, and so on. The sequence must start at  zero,
                     and  each  image  file  name must have the same number of
                     digits. Pad your initial file names with enough zeros  to
                     complete the sequence. For example, if the first image is
                     overlay_0.png,  there  can  be  only  10  images  in  the
                     sequence, with the last image being overlay_9.png. But if
                     the first image  is  overlay_00.png,  there  can  be  100
                     images in the sequence.

                 InsertionMode -> (string)
                     Choose the type of motion graphic asset that you are pro-
                     viding for your overlay. You can  choose  either  a  .mov
                     file or a series of .png files.

                 Offset -> (structure)
                     Use  Offset  to  specify  the  placement  of  your motion
                     graphic overlay on the video frame.  Specify  in  pixels,
                     from  the  upper-left  corner  of the frame. If you don't
                     specify an offset, the service scales your overlay to the
                     full  size  of  the frame. Otherwise, the service inserts
                     the overlay at its native resolution and scales the  size
                     up or down with any video scaling.

                     ImageX -> (integer)
                        Set  the  distance, in pixels, between the overlay and
                        the left edge of the video frame.

                     ImageY -> (integer)
                        Set the distance, in pixels, between the  overlay  and
                        the top edge of the video frame.

                 Playback -> (string)
                     Specify  whether your motion graphic overlay repeats on a
                     loop or plays only once.

                 StartTime -> (string)
                     Specify when the motion overlay begins. Use timecode for-
                     mat  (HH:MM:SS:FF  or  HH:MM:SS;FF).  Make  sure that the
                     timecode you provide here takes into account how you have
                     set  up  your  timecode configuration under both job set-
                     tings and input settings. The simplest way to do that  is
                     to set both to start at 0. If you need to set up your job
                     to follow timecodes embedded in your  source  that  don't
                     start  at  zero,  make sure that you specify a start time
                     that is after  the  first  embedded  timecode.  For  more
                     information,   see  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediacon-

                     and settings>inputs>timecodeSource.

              NielsenConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Settings  for  your  Nielsen  configuration.  If you don't do
                 Nielsen measurement and  analytics,  ignore  these  settings.
                 When you enable Nielsen configuration (nielsenConfiguration),
                 MediaConvert enables PCM to ID3 tagging for  all  outputs  in
                 the  job.  To  enable Nielsen configuration programmatically,
                 include an instance of nielsenConfiguration in your JSON  job
                 specification.  Even  if  you  don't  include any children of
                 nielsenConfiguration, you still enable the setting.

                 BreakoutCode -> (integer)
                     Nielsen has discontinued the use of breakout  code  func-
                     tionality.  If  you  must  include this property, set the
                     value to zero.

                 DistributorId -> (string)
                     Use Distributor ID (DistributorID) to  specify  the  dis-
                     tributor  ID  that  is  assigned  to your organization by
                     Neilsen.

              NielsenNonLinearWatermark -> (structure)
                 Ignore these settings unless you are using Nielsen non-linear
                 watermarking.  Specify  the  values that MediaConvert uses to
                 generate and place Nielsen watermarks in your  output  audio.
                 In  addition to specifying these values, you also need to set
                 up your cloud TIC server. These settings apply to every  out-
                 put in your job. The MediaConvert implementation is currently
                 with the following Nielsen versions:  Nielsen  Watermark  SDK
                 Version  5.2.1  Nielsen  NLM  Watermark  Engine Version 1.2.7
                 Nielsen Watermark Authenticator [SID_TIC] Version [5.0.0]

                 ActiveWatermarkProcess -> (string)
                     Choose the type of Nielsen watermarks that  you  want  in
                     your   outputs.   When   you   choose   NAES   2  and  NW
                     (NAES2_AND_NW), you must provide a value for the  setting
                     SID  (sourceId).  When  you  choose CBET (CBET), you must
                     provide a value for the setting CSID (cbetSourceId). When
                     you  choose NAES 2, NW, and CBET (NAES2_AND_NW_AND_CBET),
                     you must provide values for both of these settings.

                 AdiFilename -> (string)
                     Optional. Use this setting when you want the  service  to
                     include an ADI file in the Nielsen metadata .zip file. To
                     provide an ADI file, store it in Amazon S3 and provide  a
                     URL  to  it here. The URL should be in the following for-
                     mat:  S3://bucket/path/ADI-file.  For  more   information
                     about  the  metadata  .zip file, see the setting Metadata
                     destination (metadataDestination).

                 AssetId -> (string)
                     Use the asset ID that you provide to Nielsen to  uniquely
                     identify  this asset. Required for all Nielsen non-linear
                     watermarking.

                 AssetName -> (string)
                     Use the asset name that you provide to Nielsen  for  this
                     asset.  Required for all Nielsen non-linear watermarking.

                 CbetSourceId -> (string)
                     Use the CSID that Nielsen  provides  to  you.  This  CBET
                     source  ID  should  be unique to your Nielsen account but
                     common to all of your output assets that have CBET water-
                     marking. Required when you choose a value for the setting
                     Watermark types  (ActiveWatermarkProcess)  that  includes
                     CBET.

                 EpisodeId -> (string)
                     Optional.  If this asset uses an episode ID with Nielsen,
                     provide it here.

                 MetadataDestination -> (string)
                     Specify the Amazon S3 location where you  want  MediaCon-
                     vert  to save your Nielsen non-linear metadata .zip file.
                     This Amazon S3 bucket must be in the same Region  as  the
                     one  where  you  do your MediaConvert transcoding. If you
                     want to include an ADI file in this .zip  file,  use  the
                     setting  ADI  file (adiFilename) to specify it. MediaCon-
                     vert delivers the Nielsen metadata  .zip  files  only  to
                     your  metadata  destination  Amazon S3 bucket. It doesn't
                     deliver the .zip files to Nielsen.  You  are  responsible
                     for delivering the metadata .zip files to Nielsen.

                 SourceId -> (integer)
                     Use  the SID that Nielsen provides to you. This source ID
                     should be unique to your Nielsen account  but  common  to
                     all  of  your  output  assets.  Required  for all Nielsen
                     non-linear watermarking. This ID should be unique to your
                     Nielsen  account but common to all of your output assets.
                     Required for all Nielsen non-linear watermarking.

                 SourceWatermarkStatus -> (string)
                     Required. Specify whether  your  source  content  already
                     contains Nielsen non-linear watermarks. When you set this
                     value to Watermarked (WATERMARKED), the service fails the
                     job.  Nielsen requires that you add non-linear watermark-
                     ing to only  clean  content  that  doesn't  already  have
                     non-linear Nielsen watermarks.

                 TicServerUrl -> (string)
                     Specify  the  endpoint  for  the TIC server that you have
                     deployed and configured in the AWS  Cloud.  Required  for
                     all  Nielsen  non-linear watermarking. MediaConvert can't
                     connect directly to a TIC server. Instead, you  must  use
                     API Gateway to provide a RESTful interface between Media-
                     Convert and a TIC server that  you  deploy  in  your  AWS
                     account.  For  more information on deploying a TIC server
                     in your AWS account and the required API Gateway, contact
                     Nielsen support.

                 UniqueTicPerAudioTrack -> (string)
                     To  create  assets  that have the same TIC values in each
                     audio  track,  keep  the   default   value   Share   TICs
                     (SAME_TICS_PER_TRACK).  To create assets that have unique
                     TIC values for each audio track, choose Use  unique  TICs
                     (RESERVE_UNIQUE_TICS_PER_TRACK).

              OutputGroups -> (list)
                 (OutputGroups) contains one group of settings for each set of
                 outputs that share a  common  package  type.  All  unpackaged
                 files  (MPEG-4,  MPEG-2 TS, Quicktime, MXF, and no container)
                 are grouped in a single output group  as  well.  Required  in
                 (OutputGroups) is a group of settings that apply to the whole
                 group. This required object depends on the value you set  for
                 (Type) under (OutputGroups)>(OutputGroupSettings). Type, set-
                 tings object pairs are  as  follows.  *  FILE_GROUP_SETTINGS,
                 FileGroupSettings  *  HLS_GROUP_SETTINGS,  HlsGroupSettings *
                 DASH_ISO_GROUP_SETTINGS,        DashIsoGroupSettings        *
                 MS_SMOOTH_GROUP_SETTINGS,       MsSmoothGroupSettings       *
                 CMAF_GROUP_SETTINGS, CmafGroupSettings

                 (structure)
                     Group of outputs

                     AutomatedEncodingSettings -> (structure)
                        Use automated encoding  to  have  MediaConvert  choose
                        your  encoding settings for you, based on characteris-
                        tics of your input video.

                        AbrSettings -> (structure)
                            Use automated ABR to have MediaConvert set up  the
                            renditions  in  your ABR package for you automati-
                            cally, based  on  characteristics  of  your  input
                            video.  This feature optimizes video quality while
                            minimizing the overall size of your ABR package.

                            MaxAbrBitrate -> (integer)
                               Optional. The maximum target bit rate  used  in
                               your automated ABR stack. Use this value to set
                               an upper limit on the bandwidth consumed by the
                               highest-quality  rendition.  This is the rendi-
                               tion that is  delivered  to  viewers  with  the
                               fastest  internet  connections.  If  you  don't
                               specify a value, MediaConvert uses 8,000,000 (8
                               mb/s) by default.

                            MaxRenditions -> (integer)
                               Optional. The maximum number of renditions that
                               MediaConvert will create in your automated  ABR
                               stack.  The  number of renditions is determined
                               automatically, based on analysis of  each  job,
                               but  will never exceed this limit. When you set
                               this to Auto in the console, which  is  equiva-
                               lent  to excluding it from your JSON job speci-
                               fication, MediaConvert defaults to a  limit  of
                               15.

                            MinAbrBitrate -> (integer)
                               Optional.  The  minimum  target bitrate used in
                               your automated ABR stack. Use this value to set
                               a lower limit on the bitrate of video delivered
                               to viewers with slow internet  connections.  If
                               you  don't  specify  a value, MediaConvert uses
                               600,000 (600 kb/s) by default.

                     CustomName -> (string)
                        Use Custom Group Name (CustomName) to specify  a  name

                        console and can  make  your  job  settings  JSON  more
                        human-readable.  It  does not affect your outputs. Use
                        up to twelve characters that are either letters,  num-

                            AdditionalManifests -> (list)
                               By  default,  the service creates one top-level
                               .m3u8 HLS manifest and one top -level .mpd DASH
                               manifest  for  each  CMAF  output group in your
                               job. These default  manifests  reference  every
                               output  in  the  output  group. To create addi-
                               tional top-level  manifests  that  reference  a
                               subset  of  the  outputs  in  the output group,
                               specify a list of them  here.  For  each  addi-
                               tional  manifest  that you specify, the service
                               creates one HLS manifest and one DASH manifest.

                               (structure)
                                   Specify  the  details  for each pair of HLS
                                   and DASH additional manifests that you want
                                   the  service to generate for this CMAF out-
                                   put group. Each pair of manifests can  ref-
                                   erence a different subset of outputs in the
                                   group.

                                   ManifestNameModifier -> (string)
                                      Specify a name modifier that the service
                                      adds  to  the  name  of this manifest to
                                      make it different from the file names of
                                      the  other  main manifests in the output
                                      group. For example, say that the default
                                      main  manifest  for  your  HLS  group is
                                      film-name.m3u8. If you  enter  "-no-pre-
                                      mium"  for  this  setting, then the file
                                      name  the  service  generates  for  this
                                      top-level  manifest is film-name-no-pre-
                                      mium.m3u8. For HLS output groups,  spec-
                                      ify  a manifestNameModifier that is dif-
                                      ferent from the nameModifier of the out-
                                      put.  The  service  uses the output name
                                      modifier to create unique names for  the
                                      individual variant manifests.

                                   SelectedOutputs -> (list)
                                      Specify  the  outputs that you want this
                                      additional top-level manifest to  refer-
                                      ence.

                                      (string)

                            BaseUrl -> (string)
                               A  partial  URI  prefix that will be put in the
                               manifest file at the top level BaseURL element.
                               Can  be  used  if  streams are delivered from a
                               different URL than the manifest file.

                            ClientCache -> (string)
                               Disable this setting only  when  your  workflow
                               requires  the #EXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:no tag. Other-
                               wise, keep the default value Enabled  (ENABLED)
                               and  control caching in your video distribution
                               set up. For example, use the Cache-Control http
                               header.

                            CodecSpecification -> (string)
                               Specification  to  use (RFC-6381 or the default
                               RFC-4281) during m3u8 playlist generation.

                            Destination -> (string)
                               Use Destination (Destination) to specify the S3
                               output  location  and the output filename base.
                               Destination accepts format identifiers. If  you
                               do  not  specify  the base filename in the URI,
                               the service will use the filename of the  input
                               file. If your job has multiple inputs, the ser-
                               vice uses the filename of the first input file.

                            DestinationSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings  associated with the destination. Will
                               vary based on the type of destination

                               S3Settings -> (structure)
                                   Settings associated with S3 destination

                                   AccessControl -> (structure)
                                      Optional.  Have  MediaConvert  automati-
                                      cally apply Amazon S3 access control for
                                      the outputs in this output  group.  When
                                      you don't use this setting, S3 automati-
                                      cally applies the default access control
                                      list PRIVATE.

                                      CannedAcl -> (string)
                                          Choose  an  Amazon S3 canned ACL for
                                          MediaConvert to apply to  this  out-

                                   Encryption -> (structure)
                                      Settings  for  how  your job outputs are
                                      encrypted as they are uploaded to Amazon
                                      S3.

                                      EncryptionType -> (string)
                                          Specify  how you want your data keys
                                          managed.  AWS  uses  data  keys   to
                                          encrypt   your   content.  AWS  also
                                          encrypts the data  keys  themselves,
                                          using  a  customer master key (CMK),
                                          and then stores the  encrypted  data
                                          keys  alongside  your encrypted con-
                                          tent. Use this  setting  to  specify
                                          which  AWS  service manages the CMK.
                                          For simplest set up,  choose  Amazon
                                          S3  (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_S3).  If
                                          you want your master key to be  man-
                                          aged  by  AWS Key Management Service
                                          (KMS),      choose      AWS      KMS
                                          (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).     By
                                          default, when you  choose  AWS  KMS,
                                          KMS  uses  the  AWS managed customer
                                          master  key  (CMK)  associated  with
                                          Amazon S3 to encrypt your data keys.
                                          You can optionally choose to specify
                                          a  different,  customer managed CMK.
                                          Do  so  by  specifying  the   Amazon
                                          Resource  Name  (ARN) of the key for
                                          the setting KMS ARN (kmsKeyArn).

                                      KmsEncryptionContext -> (string)
                                          Optionally, specify  the  encryption
                                          context  that you want to use along-
                                          side your KMS key. AWS KMS uses this
                                          encryption   context  as  additional
                                          authenticated data (AAD) to  support
                                          authenticated encryption. This value
                                          must  be  a   base64-encoded   UTF-8
                                          string holding JSON which represents
                                          a string-string  map.  To  use  this
                                          setting,    you    must   also   set
                                          Server-side  encryption   (S3Server-
                                          SideEncryptionType)   to   AWS   KMS
                                          (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).    For

                                      KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                                          Optionally,  specify  the   customer
                                          master  key  (CMK)  that you want to
                                          use to encrypt the data key that AWS
                                          uses to encrypt your output content.
                                          Enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                                          of the CMK. To use this setting, you
                                          must also set Server-side encryption
                                          (S3ServerSideEncryptionType)  to AWS
                                          KMS (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS). If
                                          you  set  Server-side  encryption to
                                          AWS KMS  but  don't  specify  a  CMK
                                          here,  AWS  uses the AWS managed CMK
                                          associated with Amazon S3.

                            Encryption -> (structure)
                               DRM settings.

                               ConstantInitializationVector -> (string)
                                   This is a 128-bit, 16-byte hex value repre-
                                   sented  by  a  32-character text string. If
                                   this parameter is not set then the Initial-
                                   ization Vector will follow the segment num-
                                   ber by default.

                               EncryptionMethod -> (string)
                                   Specify the encryption scheme that you want
                                   the  service  to  use  when encrypting your
                                   CMAF  segments.  Choose  AES-CBC  subsample
                                   (SAMPLE-AES) or AES_CTR (AES-CTR).

                               InitializationVectorInManifest -> (string)
                                   When  you use DRM with CMAF outputs, choose
                                   whether  the  service  writes  the  128-bit

                               SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)
                                   If your output  group  type  is  CMAF,  use
                                   these  settings  when  doing DRM encryption
                                   with a  SPEKE-compliant  key  provider.  If
                                   your  output  group  type  is HLS, DASH, or
                                   Microsoft Smooth, use the  SpekeKeyProvider
                                   settings instead.

                                   CertificateArn -> (string)
                                      If you want your key provider to encrypt
                                      the content keys  that  it  provides  to
                                      MediaConvert,  set up a certificate with
                                      a master key using AWS Certificate  Man-
                                      ager.  Specify  the certificate's Amazon

                                   Url -> (string)
                                      Specify the URL to the key  server  that
                                      your  SPEKE-compliant  DRM  key provider
                                      uses to provide keys for encrypting your
                                      content.

                               StaticKeyProvider -> (structure)
                                   Use  these  settings  to  set up encryption
                                   with a static key provider.

                                   KeyFormat -> (string)
                                      Relates to DRM implementation. Sets  the
                                      value  of  the KEYFORMAT attribute. Must
                                      be 'identity' or a reverse  DNS  string.
                                      May  be  omitted to indicate an implicit

                                   static or from a key provider that  follows
                                   the  SPEKE  standard.  For more information
                                   about              SPEKE,               see

                            FragmentLength -> (integer)
                               Specify the length, in whole  seconds,  of  the
                               mp4  fragments. When you don't specify a value,
                               MediaConvert defaults to  2.  Related  setting:
                               Use Fragment length control (FragmentLengthCon-
                               trol) to specify whether the  encoder  enforces
                               this value strictly.

                            ImageBasedTrickPlay -> (string)
                               Specify  whether  MediaConvert generates images
                               for trick play. Keep the  default  value,  None
                               (NONE),  to  not  generate  any  images. Choose
                               Thumbnail (THUMBNAIL) to generate tiled  thumb-
                               nails.  Choose Thumbnail and full frame (THUMB-
                               NAIL_AND_FULLFRAME) to  generate  tiled  thumb-
                               nails  and  full-resolution  images  of  single
                               frames. When  you  enable  Write  HLS  manifest
                               (WriteHlsManifest),   MediaConvert   creates  a
                               child manifest for each set of images that  you
                               generate  and adds corresponding entries to the
                               parent manifest. When  you  enable  Write  DASH
                               manifest (WriteDashManifest), MediaConvert adds
                               an entry in the .mpd manifest for each  set  of
                               images  that you generate. A common application
                               for these images is Roku trick mode. The thumb-
                               nails  and  full-frame images that MediaConvert
                               creates with this feature are  compatible  with
                               this             Roku            specification:

                            ImageBasedTrickPlaySettings -> (structure)
                               Tile  and  thumbnail  settings  applicable when
                               imageBasedTrickPlay is ADVANCED

                               IntervalCadence -> (string)
                                   The cadence MediaConvert follows for gener-
                                   ating  thumbnails. If set to FOLLOW_IFRAME,
                                   MediaConvert generates thumbnails for  each
                                   IDR  frame  in the output (matching the GOP
                                   cadence). If set to  FOLLOW_CUSTOM,  Media-
                                   Convert  generates  thumbnails according to
                                   the interval you specify in thumbnailInter-
                                   val.

                               ThumbnailHeight -> (integer)
                                   Height  of  each thumbnail within each tile
                                   image, in pixels. Leave blank  to  maintain
                                   aspect  ratio with thumbnail width. If fol-
                                   lowing the aspect ratio  would  lead  to  a
                                   total  tile  height greater than 4096, then
                                   the job will be rejected. Must be divisible
                                   by 2.

                               ThumbnailInterval -> (double)
                                   Enter the interval, in seconds, that Media-
                                   Convert uses to generate thumbnails. If the
                                   interval  you  enter doesn't align with the
                                   output frame rate,  MediaConvert  automati-
                                   cally rounds the interval to align with the
                                   output frame rate. For example, if the out-
                                   put  frame  rate is 29.97 frames per second
                                   and you enter 5, MediaConvert  uses  a  150
                                   frame interval to generate thumbnails.

                               ThumbnailWidth -> (integer)
                                   Width  of  each  thumbnail within each tile
                                   image, in pixels. Default is 312.  Must  be
                                   divisible by 8.

                               TileHeight -> (integer)
                                   Number  of  thumbnails  in each column of a
                                   tile image. Set a value between 2 and 2048.
                                   Must be divisible by 2.

                               TileWidth -> (integer)
                                   Number  of thumbnails in each row of a tile
                                   image. Set a value between 1 and 512.

                            ManifestCompression -> (string)
                               When set to GZIP, compresses HLS playlist.

                            ManifestDurationFormat -> (string)
                               Indicates whether the  output  manifest  should
                               use floating point values for segment duration.

                            MinBufferTime -> (integer)
                               Minimum time of initially buffered  media  that
                               is needed to ensure smooth playout.

                            MinFinalSegmentLength -> (double)
                               Keep  this  setting  at the default value of 0,
                               unless you are troubleshooting a  problem  with
                               how  devices  play  back  the end of your video
                               asset. If you  know  that  player  devices  are
                               hanging  on  the  final  segment  of your video
                               because the length of your final segment is too
                               short,  use  this  setting to specify a minimum
                               final segment  length,  in  seconds.  Choose  a
                               value  that  is  greater than or equal to 1 and
                               less than your segment length. When you specify
                               a value for this setting, the encoder will com-
                               bine any final segment that is shorter than the
                               length  that you specify with the previous seg-
                               ment. For example, your  segment  length  is  3
                               seconds  and  your  final segment is .5 seconds
                               without a minimum final  segment  length;  when
                               you  set the minimum final segment length to 1,
                               your final segment is 3.5 seconds.

                            MpdProfile -> (string)
                               Specify whether your DASH profile is  on-demand
                               or   main.   When   you   choose  Main  profile
                               (MAIN_PROFILE),     the     service     signals
                               urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-main:2011  in  your
                               .mpd DASH manifest. When you  choose  On-demand
                               (ON_DEMAND_PROFILE),    the   service   signals
                               urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-on-demand:2011   in
                               your  .mpd. When you choose On-demand, you must
                               also set the output group setting Segment  con-
                               trol  (SegmentControl)  to  Single  file  (SIN-

                               Use this setting only when  your  output  video
                               stream  has  B-frames, which causes the initial
                               presentation time stamp (PTS) to be offset from
                               the  initial  decode  time stamp (DTS). Specify
                               how MediaConvert handles PTS when writing  time
                               stamps  in  output DASH manifests. Choose Match
                               initial PTS (MATCH_INITIAL_PTS) when  you  want
                               MediaConvert  to  use  the  initial  PTS as the
                               first  time  stamp  in  the  manifest.   Choose
                               Zero-based  (ZERO_BASED)  to  have MediaConvert
                               ignore the initial PTS in the video stream  and
                               instead write the initial time stamp as zero in
                               the  manifest.  For  outputs  that  don't  have
                               B-frames,  the  time  stamps in your DASH mani-
                               fests start at zero regardless of  your  choice
                               here.

                            SegmentControl -> (string)
                               When  set  to SINGLE_FILE, a single output file
                               is generated,  which  is  internally  segmented
                               using  the  Fragment Length and Segment Length.
                               When set to SEGMENTED_FILES,  separate  segment
                               files will be created.

                            SegmentLength -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  length, in whole seconds, of each
                               segment. When you don't specify a value, Media-
                               Convert  defaults  to 10. Related settings: Use
                               Segment length  control  (SegmentLengthControl)
                               to  specify  whether  the encoder enforces this
                               value strictly. Use Segment  control  (CmafSeg-
                               mentControl)  to  specify  whether MediaConvert
                               creates separate segment files or  one  content
                               file  that  has  metadata  to  mark the segment
                               boundaries.

                            SegmentLengthControl -> (string)
                               Specify how you want MediaConvert to  determine
                               the  segment  length.  Choose  Exact (EXACT) to
                               have the encoder use the exact length that  you
                               specify  with  the setting Segment length (Seg-
                               mentLength).  This  might   result   in   extra
                               I-frames. Choose Multiple of GOP (GOP_MULTIPLE)
                               to  have  the  encoder  round  up  the  segment
                               lengths to match the next GOP boundary.

                            StreamInfResolution -> (string)
                               Include  or  exclude  RESOLUTION  attribute for
                               video in EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag of variant  mani-

                            TargetDurationCompatibilityMode -> (string)
                               When set to LEGACY, the segment target duration
                               is always rounded up  to  the  nearest  integer
                               value  above its current value in seconds. When
                               set  to  SPEC\_COMPLIANT,  the  segment  target
                               duration  is  rounded up to the nearest integer
                               value if fraction seconds are greater  than  or
                               equal  to 0.5 (>= 0.5) and rounded down if less
                               than 0.5 (<0.5). You may need to use LEGACY  if
                               your  client  needs  to  ensure that the target
                               duration is always longer than the actual dura-
                               tion  of  the  segment.  Some older players may
                               experience interrupted playback when the actual
                               duration of a track in a segment is longer than
                               the target duration.

                            WriteDashManifest -> (string)
                               When set to ENABLED, a DASH MPD  manifest  will
                               be generated for this output.

                            WriteHlsManifest -> (string)
                               When set to ENABLED, an Apple HLS manifest will
                               be generated for this output.

                            WriteSegmentTimelineInRepresentation -> (string)
                               When you enable  Precise  segment  duration  in
                               DASH manifests (writeSegmentTimelineInRepresen-
                               tation), your DASH manifest shows precise  seg-
                               ment  durations.  The segment duration informa-
                               tion appears inside  the  SegmentTimeline  ele-
                               ment, inside SegmentTemplate at the Representa-
                               tion level. When this  feature  isn't  enabled,
                               the segment durations in your DASH manifest are
                               approximate. The segment  duration  information
                               appears  in  the duration attribute of the Seg-
                               mentTemplate element.

                        DashIsoGroupSettings -> (structure)

                            AdditionalManifests -> (list)
                               By default, the service creates one  .mpd  DASH
                               manifest for each DASH ISO output group in your
                               job. This  default  manifest  references  every
                               output  in  the  output  group. To create addi-
                               tional DASH manifests that reference  a  subset
                               of  the  outputs in the output group, specify a
                               list of them here.

                                   Specify the  details  for  each  additional
                                   DASH  manifest that you want the service to
                                   generate for this output group. Each  mani-
                                   fest  can  reference  a different subset of
                                   outputs in the group.

                                   ManifestNameModifier -> (string)
                                      Specify a name modifier that the service
                                      adds  to  the  name  of this manifest to
                                      make it different from the file names of
                                      the  other  main manifests in the output
                                      group. For example, say that the default
                                      main  manifest  for  your  DASH group is
                                      film-name.mpd. If  you  enter  "-no-pre-
                                      mium"  for  this  setting, then the file
                                      name  the  service  generates  for  this
                                      top-level  manifest is film-name-no-pre-

                            AudioChannelConfigSchemeIdUri -> (string)
                               Use this setting only when your audio codec  is
                               a  Dolby  one  (AC3,  EAC3,  or Atmos) and your
                               downstream workflow  requires  that  your  DASH
                               manifest  use  the  Dolby channel configuration
                               tag, rather than the MPEG one. For example, you
                               might  need  to  use  this  to  make dynamic ad
                               insertion work.  Specify  which  audio  channel

                               FIGURATION), to have MediaConvert  write  this:
                               urn:mpeg:mpegB:cicp:ChannelConfiguration.
                               Choose Dolby channel configuration (DOLBY_CHAN-
                               NEL_CONFIGURATION)  to  have MediaConvert write
                               this                                   instead:

                            BaseUrl -> (string)
                               A partial URI prefix that will be  put  in  the

                               element. Can be used if streams  are  delivered
                               from a different URL than the manifest file.

                            Destination -> (string)
                               Use Destination (Destination) to specify the S3
                               output location and the output  filename  base.
                               Destination  accepts format identifiers. If you
                               do not specify the base filename  in  the  URI,
                               the  service will use the filename of the input
                               file. If your job has multiple inputs, the ser-
                               vice uses the filename of the first input file.

                                          (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).     By
                                          default,  when  you  choose AWS KMS,
                                          KMS uses the  AWS  managed  customer
                                          master  key  (CMK)  associated  with
                                          Amazon S3 to encrypt your data keys.
                                          You can optionally choose to specify
                                          a different, customer  managed  CMK.
                                          Do   so  by  specifying  the  Amazon
                                          Resource Name (ARN) of the  key  for
                                          the setting KMS ARN (kmsKeyArn).

                                      KmsEncryptionContext -> (string)
                                          Optionally,  specify  the encryption
                                          context that you want to use  along-
                                          side your KMS key. AWS KMS uses this
                                          encryption  context  as   additional
                                          authenticated  data (AAD) to support
                                          authenticated encryption. This value
                                          must   be   a  base64-encoded  UTF-8
                                          string holding JSON which represents
                                          a  string-string  map.  To  use this
                                          setting,   you   must    also    set
                                          Server-side   encryption  (S3Server-
                                          SideEncryptionType)   to   AWS   KMS
                                          (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).    For
                                          more  information  about  encryption
                                          context,                        see:

                                      KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                                          Optionally,   specify  the  customer
                                          master key (CMK) that  you  want  to
                                          use to encrypt the data key that AWS
                                          uses to encrypt your output content.
                                          Enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                                          of the CMK. To use this setting, you
                                          must also set Server-side encryption
                                          (S3ServerSideEncryptionType) to  AWS
                                          KMS (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS). If
                                          you set  Server-side  encryption  to
                                          AWS  KMS  but  don't  specify  a CMK
                                          here, AWS uses the AWS  managed  CMK
                                          associated with Amazon S3.

                               PlaybackDeviceCompatibility -> (string)
                                   This  setting can improve the compatibility
                                   of your output with video players on  obso-
                                   lete devices. It applies only to DASH H.264
                                   outputs with DRM encryption.  Choose  Unen-
                                   crypted  SEI (UNENCRYPTED_SEI) only to cor-
                                   rect  problems  with  playback   on   older
                                   devices.  Otherwise,  keep the default set-
                                   ting CENC v1 (CENC_V1). If you choose Unen-
                                   crypted  SEI,  for that output, the service
                                   will exclude the access unit delimiter  and
                                   will leave the SEI NAL units unencrypted.

                               SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)
                                   If  your output group type is HLS, DASH, or
                                   Microsoft Smooth, use these  settings  when
                                   doing DRM encryption with a SPEKE-compliant
                                   key provider. If your output group type  is
                                   CMAF, use the SpekeKeyProviderCmaf settings
                                   instead.

                                   CertificateArn -> (string)
                                      If you want your key provider to encrypt
                                      the  content  keys  that  it provides to
                                      MediaConvert, set up a certificate  with
                                      a  master key using AWS Certificate Man-
                                      ager. Specify the  certificate's  Amazon
                                      Resource Name (ARN) here.

                                   ResourceId -> (string)
                                      Specify   the   resource  ID  that  your
                                      SPEKE-compliant  key  provider  uses  to
                                      identify this content.

                                   SystemIds -> (list)
                                      Relates  to  SPEKE  implementation.  DRM
                                      system identifiers. DASH  output  groups
                                      support  a  max of two system ids. Other
                                      group types support one system  id.  See
                                      https://dashif.org/identifiers/content_protection/

                                   Url -> (string)
                                      Specify the URL to the key  server  that
                                      your  SPEKE-compliant  DRM  key provider
                                      uses to provide keys for encrypting your
                                      content.

                            FragmentLength -> (integer)
                               Length  of  fragments to generate (in seconds).
                               Fragment length must  be  compatible  with  GOP
                               size  and  Framerate.  Note that fragments will
                               end on the next keyframe after this  number  of
                               seconds,  so  actual  fragment  length  may  be
                               longer. When Emit Single File is  checked,  the
                               fragmentation  is  internal  to a single output
                               file and it does not cause the creation of many
                               output files as in other output types.

                            HbbtvCompliance -> (string)
                               Supports HbbTV specification as indicated

                            ImageBasedTrickPlay -> (string)
                               Specify  whether  MediaConvert generates images
                               for trick play. Keep the  default  value,  None
                               (NONE),  to  not  generate  any  images. Choose
                               Thumbnail (THUMBNAIL) to generate tiled  thumb-
                               nails.  Choose Thumbnail and full frame (THUMB-
                               NAIL_AND_FULLFRAME) to  generate  tiled  thumb-
                               nails  and  full-resolution  images  of  single
                               frames. MediaConvert adds an entry in the  .mpd
                               manifest for each set of images that you gener-
                               ate. A common application for these  images  is
                               Roku  trick mode. The thumbnails and full-frame
                               images that MediaConvert creates with this fea-
                               ture  are  compatible with this Roku specifica-

                            ImageBasedTrickPlaySettings -> (structure)
                               Tile and  thumbnail  settings  applicable  when
                               imageBasedTrickPlay is ADVANCED

                               IntervalCadence -> (string)
                                   The cadence MediaConvert follows for gener-
                                   ating thumbnails. If set to  FOLLOW_IFRAME,
                                   MediaConvert  generates thumbnails for each
                                   IDR frame in the output (matching  the  GOP
                                   cadence).  If  set to FOLLOW_CUSTOM, Media-
                                   Convert generates thumbnails  according  to
                                   the interval you specify in thumbnailInter-
                                   val.

                               ThumbnailHeight -> (integer)
                                   Height of each thumbnail within  each  tile
                                   image,  in  pixels. Leave blank to maintain
                                   aspect ratio with thumbnail width. If  fol-
                                   lowing  the  aspect  ratio  would lead to a
                                   total tile height greater than  4096,  then
                                   the job will be rejected. Must be divisible
                                   by 2.

                               ThumbnailInterval -> (double)
                                   Enter the interval, in seconds, that Media-
                                   Convert uses to generate thumbnails. If the
                                   interval you enter doesn't align  with  the
                                   output  frame  rate, MediaConvert automati-
                                   cally rounds the interval to align with the
                                   output frame rate. For example, if the out-
                                   put frame rate is 29.97 frames  per  second
                                   and  you  enter  5, MediaConvert uses a 150
                                   frame interval to generate thumbnails.

                               ThumbnailWidth -> (integer)
                                   Width of each thumbnail  within  each  tile
                                   image,  in  pixels. Default is 312. Must be
                                   divisible by 8.

                               TileHeight -> (integer)
                                   Number of thumbnails in each  column  of  a
                                   tile image. Set a value between 2 and 2048.
                                   Must be divisible by 2.

                               TileWidth -> (integer)
                                   Number of thumbnails in each row of a  tile
                                   image. Set a value between 1 and 512.

                            MinBufferTime -> (integer)
                               Minimum  time  of initially buffered media that
                               is needed to ensure smooth playout.

                            MinFinalSegmentLength -> (double)
                               Keep this setting at the default  value  of  0,
                               unless  you  are troubleshooting a problem with
                               how devices play back the  end  of  your  video
                               asset.  If  you  know  that  player devices are
                               hanging on the  final  segment  of  your  video
                               because the length of your final segment is too
                               short, use this setting to  specify  a  minimum
                               final  segment  length,  in  seconds.  Choose a
                               value that is greater than or equal  to  1  and
                               less than your segment length. When you specify
                               a value for this setting, the encoder will com-
                               bine any final segment that is shorter than the
                               length that you specify with the previous  seg-
                               ment.  For  example,  your  segment length is 3
                               seconds and your final segment  is  .5  seconds
                               without  a  minimum  final segment length; when
                               you set the minimum final segment length to  1,
                               your final segment is 3.5 seconds.

                            MpdProfile -> (string)
                               Specify  whether your DASH profile is on-demand
                               or  main.  When   you   choose   Main   profile
                               (MAIN_PROFILE),     the     service     signals
                               urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-main:2011  in  your
                               .mpd  DASH  manifest. When you choose On-demand
                               (ON_DEMAND_PROFILE),   the   service    signals
                               urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-on-demand:2011   in
                               your .mpd. When you choose On-demand, you  must
                               also  set the output group setting Segment con-
                               trol  (SegmentControl)  to  Single  file  (SIN-
                               GLE_FILE).

                            PtsOffsetHandlingForBFrames -> (string)
                               Use  this  setting  only when your output video
                               stream has B-frames, which causes  the  initial
                               presentation time stamp (PTS) to be offset from
                               the initial decode time  stamp  (DTS).  Specify
                               how  MediaConvert handles PTS when writing time
                               stamps in output DASH manifests.  Choose  Match
                               initial  PTS  (MATCH_INITIAL_PTS) when you want
                               MediaConvert to use  the  initial  PTS  as  the
                               first   time  stamp  in  the  manifest.  Choose
                               Zero-based (ZERO_BASED)  to  have  MediaConvert
                               ignore  the initial PTS in the video stream and
                               instead write the initial time stamp as zero in
                               the  manifest.  For  outputs  that  don't  have
                               B-frames, the time stamps in  your  DASH  mani-
                               fests  start  at zero regardless of your choice
                               here.

                            SegmentControl -> (string)
                               When set to SINGLE_FILE, a single  output  file
                               is  generated,  which  is  internally segmented
                               using the Fragment Length and  Segment  Length.
                               When  set  to SEGMENTED_FILES, separate segment
                               files will be created.

                            SegmentLength -> (integer)
                               Specify the length, in whole seconds,  of  each
                               segment. When you don't specify a value, Media-
                               Convert defaults to 30. Related  settings:  Use
                               Segment  length  control (SegmentLengthControl)
                               to specify whether the  encoder  enforces  this
                               value    strictly.    Use    Segment    control
                               (DashIsoSegmentControl)  to   specify   whether
                               MediaConvert  creates separate segment files or
                               one content file that has metadata to mark  the
                               segment boundaries.

                            SegmentLengthControl -> (string)
                               Specify  how you want MediaConvert to determine
                               the segment length.  Choose  Exact  (EXACT)  to
                               have  the encoder use the exact length that you
                               specify with the setting Segment  length  (Seg-
                               mentLength).   This   might   result  in  extra
                               I-frames. Choose Multiple of GOP (GOP_MULTIPLE)
                               to  have  the  encoder  round  up  the  segment
                               lengths to match the next GOP boundary.

                            WriteSegmentTimelineInRepresentation -> (string)
                               If you get an HTTP error in the 400 range  when
                               you  play  back  your  DASH output, enable this
                               setting and run  your  transcoding  job  again.
                               When  you  enable  this  setting,  the  service
                               writes precise segment durations  in  the  DASH
                               manifest.   The  segment  duration  information
                               appears  inside  the  SegmentTimeline  element,
                               inside  SegmentTemplate  at  the Representation
                               level. When you don't enable this setting,  the
                               service writes approximate segment durations in
                               your DASH manifest.

                        FileGroupSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings related to your File output group. Media-
                            Convert  uses this group of settings to generate a
                            single standalone file, rather  than  a  streaming
                            package.  When  you work directly in your JSON job
                            specification,  include  this   object   and   any
                            required children when you set Type, under Output-
                            GroupSettings, to FILE_GROUP_SETTINGS.

                            Destination -> (string)
                               Use Destination (Destination) to specify the S3
                               output  location  and the output filename base.
                               Destination accepts format identifiers. If  you
                               do  not  specify  the base filename in the URI,
                               the service will use the filename of the  input
                               file. If your job has multiple inputs, the ser-
                               vice uses the filename of the first input file.

                            DestinationSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings  associated with the destination. Will
                               vary based on the type of destination

                               S3Settings -> (structure)

                                   AccessControl -> (structure)
                                      Optional.  Have  MediaConvert  automati-
                                      cally apply Amazon S3 access control for
                                      the outputs in this output  group.  When
                                      you don't use this setting, S3 automati-
                                      cally applies the default access control
                                      list PRIVATE.

                                      EncryptionType -> (string)
                                          Specify  how you want your data keys
                                          managed.  AWS  uses  data  keys   to
                                          encrypt   your   content.  AWS  also
                                          encrypts the data  keys  themselves,
                                          using  a  customer master key (CMK),
                                          and then stores the  encrypted  data
                                          keys  alongside  your encrypted con-
                                          tent. Use this  setting  to  specify
                                          which  AWS  service manages the CMK.
                                          For simplest set up,  choose  Amazon
                                          S3  (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_S3).  If
                                          you want your master key to be  man-
                                          aged  by  AWS Key Management Service
                                          (KMS),      choose      AWS      KMS
                                          (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).     By
                                          default, when you  choose  AWS  KMS,
                                          KMS  uses  the  AWS managed customer
                                          master  key  (CMK)  associated  with
                                          Amazon S3 to encrypt your data keys.
                                          You can optionally choose to specify
                                          a  different,  customer managed CMK.
                                          Do  so  by  specifying  the   Amazon
                                          Resource  Name  (ARN) of the key for
                                          the setting KMS ARN (kmsKeyArn).

                                      KmsEncryptionContext -> (string)
                                          Optionally, specify  the  encryption
                                          context  that you want to use along-
                                          side your KMS key. AWS KMS uses this
                                          encryption   context  as  additional
                                          authenticated data (AAD) to  support
                                          authenticated encryption. This value
                                          must  be  a   base64-encoded   UTF-8
                                          string holding JSON which represents
                                          a string-string  map.  To  use  this
                                          setting,    you    must   also   set
                                          Server-side  encryption   (S3Server-
                                          SideEncryptionType)   to   AWS   KMS
                                          (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).    For

                                      KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                                          Optionally,  specify  the   customer
                                          master  key  (CMK)  that you want to
                                          use to encrypt the data key that AWS
                                          uses to encrypt your output content.
                                          Enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                                          of the CMK. To use this setting, you
                                          must also set Server-side encryption
                                          (S3ServerSideEncryptionType)  to AWS
                                          KMS (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS). If
                                          you  set  Server-side  encryption to
                                          AWS KMS  but  don't  specify  a  CMK
                                          here,  AWS  uses the AWS managed CMK
                                          associated with Amazon S3.

                               your  Apple HLS manifest. This setting does not
                               determine whether SCTE-35 markers appear in the
                               outputs themselves.

                            AdditionalManifests -> (list)
                               By  default,  the service creates one top-level
                               .m3u8 HLS manifest for each HLS output group in
                               your  job.  This  default  manifest  references
                               every output in the  output  group.  To  create
                               additional top-level manifests that reference a
                               subset of the  outputs  in  the  output  group,
                               specify a list of them here.

                               (structure)
                                   Specify the details for each additional HLS
                                   manifest that you want the service to  gen-
                                   erate  for this output group. Each manifest
                                   can reference a different subset of outputs
                                   in the group.

                                   ManifestNameModifier -> (string)
                                      Specify a name modifier that the service
                                      adds to the name  of  this  manifest  to
                                      make it different from the file names of
                                      the other main manifests in  the  output
                                      group. For example, say that the default
                                      main manifest  for  your  HLS  group  is
                                      film-name.m3u8.  If  you enter "-no-pre-
                                      mium" for this setting,  then  the  file
                                      name  the  service  generates  for  this
                                      top-level manifest is  film-name-no-pre-
                                      mium.m3u8.  For HLS output groups, spec-
                                      ify a manifestNameModifier that is  dif-
                                      ferent from the nameModifier of the out-
                                      put. The service uses  the  output  name
                                      modifier  to create unique names for the
                                      individual variant manifests.

                            BaseUrl -> (string)
                               A  partial URI prefix that will be prepended to
                               each output in the media  .m3u8  file.  Can  be
                               used  if base manifest is delivered from a dif-
                               ferent URL than the main .m3u8 file.

                            ClientCache -> (string)
                               Disable  this  setting  only when your workflow
                               requires the #EXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:no tag.  Other-

                               Use Destination (Destination) to specify the S3
                               output location and the output  filename  base.
                               Destination  accepts format identifiers. If you
                               do not specify the base filename  in  the  URI,
                               the  service will use the filename of the input
                               file. If your job has multiple inputs, the ser-
                               vice uses the filename of the first input file.

                                          managed.   AWS  uses  data  keys  to
                                          encrypt  your  content.   AWS   also
                                          encrypts  the  data keys themselves,
                                          using a customer master  key  (CMK),
                                          and  then  stores the encrypted data
                                          keys alongside your  encrypted  con-
                                          tent.  Use  this  setting to specify
                                          which AWS service manages  the  CMK.
                                          For  simplest  set up, choose Amazon
                                          S3  (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_S3).  If

                                          KMS uses the  AWS  managed  customer
                                          master  key  (CMK)  associated  with
                                          Amazon S3 to encrypt your data keys.
                                          You can optionally choose to specify
                                          a different, customer  managed  CMK.
                                          Do   so  by  specifying  the  Amazon

                                          side your KMS key. AWS KMS uses this
                                          encryption  context  as   additional
                                          authenticated  data (AAD) to support

                                          a  string-string  map.  To  use this
                                          setting,   you   must    also    set

                                          use to encrypt the data key that AWS
                                          uses to encrypt your output content.
                                          Enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)

                                   ating thumbnails. If set to  FOLLOW_IFRAME,
                                   MediaConvert  generates thumbnails for each
                                   IDR frame in the output (matching  the  GOP
                                   cadence).  If  set to FOLLOW_CUSTOM, Media-
                                   Convert generates thumbnails  according  to
                                   the interval you specify in thumbnailInter-
                                   val.

                               ThumbnailHeight -> (integer)
                                   Height of each thumbnail within  each  tile
                                   image,  in  pixels. Leave blank to maintain
                                   aspect ratio with thumbnail width. If  fol-
                                   lowing  the  aspect  ratio  would lead to a
                                   total tile height greater than  4096,  then
                                   the job will be rejected. Must be divisible
                                   by 2.

                               ThumbnailInterval -> (double)
                                   Enter the interval, in seconds, that Media-
                                   Convert uses to generate thumbnails. If the
                                   interval you enter doesn't align  with  the
                                   output  frame  rate, MediaConvert automati-
                                   cally rounds the interval to align with the
                                   output frame rate. For example, if the out-
                                   put frame rate is 29.97 frames  per  second
                                   and  you  enter  5, MediaConvert uses a 150
                                   frame interval to generate thumbnails.

                               ThumbnailWidth -> (integer)
                                   Width of each thumbnail  within  each  tile
                                   image,  in  pixels. Default is 312. Must be
                                   divisible by 8.

                               TileHeight -> (integer)
                                   Number of thumbnails in each  column  of  a
                                   tile image. Set a value between 2 and 2048.
                                   Must be divisible by 2.

                               TileWidth -> (integer)
                                   Number of thumbnails in each row of a  tile
                                   image. Set a value between 1 and 512.

                            ManifestCompression -> (string)
                               When set to GZIP, compresses HLS playlist.

                            ManifestDurationFormat -> (string)
                               Indicates  whether  the  output manifest should
                               use floating point values for segment duration.

                            MinFinalSegmentLength -> (double)
                               Keep  this  setting  at the default value of 0,
                               unless you are troubleshooting a  problem  with
                               how  devices  play  back  the end of your video
                               asset. If you  know  that  player  devices  are
                               hanging  on  the  final  segment  of your video
                               because the length of your final segment is too
                               short,  use  this  setting to specify a minimum
                               final segment  length,  in  seconds.  Choose  a
                               value  that  is  greater than or equal to 1 and
                               less than your segment length. When you specify
                               a value for this setting, the encoder will com-
                               bine any final segment that is shorter than the
                               length  that you specify with the previous seg-
                               ment. For example, your  segment  length  is  3
                               seconds  and  your  final segment is .5 seconds
                               without a minimum final  segment  length;  when
                               you  set the minimum final segment length to 1,
                               your final segment is 3.5 seconds.

                            MinSegmentLength -> (integer)
                               When set, Minimum Segment Size is  enforced  by
                               looking  ahead  and  back  within the specified
                               range for a nearby avail and extending the seg-
                               ment size if needed.

                            OutputSelection -> (string)
                               Indicates   whether  the  .m3u8  manifest  file
                               should be generated for this HLS output  group.

                            ProgramDateTime -> (string)
                               Includes  or  excludes  EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME
                               tag in .m3u8 manifest files. The value is  cal-
                               culated as follows: either the program date and
                               time are initialized using the  input  timecode
                               source,  or  the  time is initialized using the
                               input timecode source and the date is  initial-
                               ized using the timestamp_offset.

                            ProgramDateTimePeriod -> (integer)
                               Period  of insertion of EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME
                               entry, in seconds.

                            SegmentControl -> (string)
                               When set to SINGLE_FILE,  emits  program  as  a
                               single   media   resource   (.ts)   file,  uses
                               #EXT-X-BYTERANGE  tags  to  index  segment  for
                               playback.

                            SegmentLength -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  length, in whole seconds, of each
                               segment. When you don't specify a value, Media-
                               Convert  defaults  to 10. Related settings: Use
                               Segment length  control  (SegmentLengthControl)
                               to  specify  whether  the encoder enforces this
                               value strictly. Use  Segment  control  (HlsSeg-
                               mentControl)  to  specify  whether MediaConvert
                               creates separate segment files or  one  content
                               file  that  has  metadata  to  mark the segment
                               boundaries.

                            SegmentLengthControl -> (string)
                               Specify how you want MediaConvert to  determine
                               the  segment  length.  Choose  Exact (EXACT) to
                               have the encoder use the exact length that  you
                               specify  with  the setting Segment length (Seg-
                               mentLength).  This  might   result   in   extra
                               I-frames. Choose Multiple of GOP (GOP_MULTIPLE)
                               to  have  the  encoder  round  up  the  segment
                               lengths to match the next GOP boundary.

                            SegmentsPerSubdirectory -> (integer)
                               Number  of  segments to write to a subdirectory
                               before starting a new  one.  directoryStructure
                               must  be  SINGLE_DIRECTORY  for this setting to
                               have an effect.

                            StreamInfResolution -> (string)
                               Include or  exclude  RESOLUTION  attribute  for
                               video  in EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag of variant mani-
                               fest.

                            TargetDurationCompatibilityMode -> (string)
                               When set to LEGACY, the segment target duration
                               is  always  rounded  up  to the nearest integer
                               value above its current value in seconds.  When
                               set  to  SPEC\_COMPLIANT,  the  segment  target
                               duration is rounded up to the  nearest  integer
                               value  if  fraction seconds are greater than or
                               equal to 0.5 (>= 0.5) and rounded down if  less
                               than  0.5 (<0.5). You may need to use LEGACY if
                               your client needs to  ensure  that  the  target
                               duration is always longer than the actual dura-
                               tion of the segment.  Some  older  players  may
                               experience interrupted playback when the actual
                               duration of a track in a segment is longer than
                               the target duration.

                            TimedMetadataId3Frame -> (string)
                               Indicates ID3 frame that has the timecode.

                            TimedMetadataId3Period -> (integer)
                               Timed Metadata interval in seconds.

                            TimestampDeltaMilliseconds -> (integer)
                               Provides  an  extra millisecond delta offset to
                               fine tune the timestamps.

                        MsSmoothGroupSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings related to your Microsoft Smooth  Stream-
                            ing  output  package.  For  more  information, see

                            AdditionalManifests -> (list)
                               By  default,  the  service  creates  one   .ism
                               Microsoft  Smooth  Streaming  manifest for each
                               Microsoft Smooth Streaming output group in your
                               job.  This  default  manifest  references every
                               output in the output  group.  To  create  addi-
                               tional manifests that reference a subset of the
                               outputs in the output group, specify a list  of
                               them here.

                               (structure)
                                   Specify  the  details  for  each additional
                                   Microsoft Smooth  Streaming  manifest  that
                                   you  want  the service to generate for this
                                   output group. Each manifest can reference a
                                   different subset of outputs in the group.

                                   ManifestNameModifier -> (string)
                                      Specify a name modifier that the service
                                      adds to the name  of  this  manifest  to
                                      make it different from the file names of
                                      the other main manifests in  the  output
                                      group. For example, say that the default
                                      main manifest for your Microsoft  Smooth
                                      group  is  film-name.ismv.  If you enter
                                      "-no-premium" for this setting, then the
                                      file name the service generates for this
                                      top-level manifest is  film-name-no-pre-
                                      mium.ismv.

                                   SelectedOutputs -> (list)
                                      Specify  the  outputs that you want this
                                      additional top-level manifest to  refer-

                            Destination -> (string)
                               Use Destination (Destination) to specify the S3
                               output  location  and the output filename base.
                               Destination accepts format identifiers. If  you
                               do  not  specify  the base filename in the URI,
                               the service will use the filename of the  input
                               file. If your job has multiple inputs, the ser-
                               vice uses the filename of the first input file.

                            DestinationSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings  associated with the destination. Will
                               vary based on the type of destination

                               S3Settings -> (structure)
                                   Settings associated with S3 destination

                                   AccessControl -> (structure)

                                      the outputs in this output  group.  When
                                      you don't use this setting, S3 automati-
                                      cally applies the default access control

                                          Specify  how you want your data keys
                                          managed.  AWS  uses  data  keys   to
                                          encrypt   your   content.  AWS  also
                                          encrypts the data  keys  themselves,
                                          using  a  customer master key (CMK),
                                          and then stores the  encrypted  data
                                          keys  alongside  your encrypted con-
                                          tent. Use this  setting  to  specify
                                          which  AWS  service manages the CMK.
                                          For simplest set up,  choose  Amazon

                                          (KMS),      choose      AWS      KMS
                                          (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).     By
                                          default, when you  choose  AWS  KMS,
                                          KMS  uses  the  AWS managed customer
                                          master  key  (CMK)  associated  with
                                          Amazon S3 to encrypt your data keys.
                                          You can optionally choose to specify
                                          a  different,  customer managed CMK.
                                          Do  so  by  specifying  the   Amazon

                               encoding  settings  organized  by  audio codec.
                               Include one instance of (AudioDescriptions) per
                               output.  (AudioDescriptions) can contain multi-
                               ple groups of encoding settings.

                               (structure)

                                   MediaConvert  console. In your job JSON, an
                                   instance of AudioDescription is  equivalent
                                   to  one  audio tab in the console. Usually,
                                   one audio tab  corresponds  to  one  output
                                   audio  track.  Depending  on how you set up
                                   your input audio selectors and whether  you
                                   use  audio  selector  groups, one audio tab
                                   can correspond to a group of  output  audio
                                   tracks.

                                   AudioChannelTaggingSettings -> (structure)
                                      When  you  mimic  a  multi-channel audio
                                      layout   with   multiple    mono-channel
                                      tracks,  you can tag each channel layout
                                      manually. For example, you would tag the
                                      tracks  that  contain  your left, right,
                                      and center audio with  Left  (L),  Right
                                      (R),  and Center (C), respectively. When
                                      you don't specify a value,  MediaConvert
                                      labels  your  track  as  Center  (C)  by
                                      default. To use  audio  layout  tagging,
                                      your  output  must  be  in  a  QuickTime
                                      (.mov) container; your audio codec  must
                                      be  AAC,  WAV, or AIFF; and you must set
                                      up your audio track  to  have  only  one
                                      channel.

                                      ChannelTag -> (string)
                                          You   can   add   a   tag  for  this
                                          mono-channel audio  track  to  mimic
                                          its  placement  in  a  multi-channel
                                          layout. For example, if  this  track
                                          is the left surround channel, choose
                                          Left surround (LS).

                                      TargetLkfs -> (double)
                                          When  you  use  Audio  normalization

                                          specify a value  here,  the  encoder
                                          chooses  a  value  for you, based on
                                          the algorithm that  you  choose  for
                                          Algorithm (algorithm). If you choose
                                          algorithm 1770-1, the  encoder  will
                                          choose   -24  LKFS;  otherwise,  the
                                          encoder will choose -23 LKFS.

                                   AudioSourceName -> (string)
                                      Specifies which audio data to  use  from

                                   CodecSettings -> (structure)
                                      Settings related to audio encoding.  The
                                      settings in this group vary depending on
                                      the value that you choose for your audio
                                      codec.

                                      AacSettings -> (structure)
                                          Required  when you set (Codec) under

                                          to   the   value  AAC.  The  service
                                          accepts one of two  mutually  exclu-

                                          CBR. To select one of  these  modes,
                                          set  the  value  of  Bitrate control
                                          mode (rateControlMode) to  "VBR"  or
                                          "CBR".  In VBR mode, you control the
                                          audio quality with the  setting  VBR
                                          quality  (vbrQuality).  In CBR mode,
                                          you   use   the   setting    Bitrate
                                          (bitrate). Defaults and valid values
                                          depend on the rate control mode.

                                             In  this  case,  the encoder will
                                             use any values  you  provide  for

                                          method,  rather than a captions for-
                                          mat.  Burn-in  writes  the  captions
                                          directly   on   your  video  frames,
                                          replacing pixels  of  video  content
                                          with  the  captions.  Set up burn-in
                                          captions in the same output as  your
                                          video.  For  more  information,  see

                                   LanguageCode -> (string)
                                      Specify the language  of  this  captions
                                      output  track.  For most captions output
                                      formats, the encoder puts this  language
                                      information in the output captions meta-
                                      data. If your output captions format  is
                                      DVB-Sub  or  Burn  in,  the encoder uses
                                      this language information to choose  the
                                      font language for rendering the captions
                                      text.

                                   LanguageDescription -> (string)
                                      Specify a label for this set  of  output
                                      captions.    For   example,   "English",
                                      "Director commentary", or "track_2". For
                                      streaming  outputs,  MediaConvert passes
                                      this information into destination  mani-
                                      fests  for  display  on the end-viewer's
                                      player device. For outputs in other out-
                                      put  groups,  the  service  ignores this

                                   AudioDuration -> (string)
                                      Specify this setting only when your out-
                                      put  will  be  consumed  by a downstream
                                      repackaging workflow that  is  sensitive
                                      to   very   small  duration  differences
                                      between video and audio. For this situa-
                                      tion,   choose   Match   video  duration
                                      (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION).  In  all   other
                                      cases,  keep  the default value, Default
                                      codec duration (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION).
                                      When  you  choose  Match video duration,
                                      MediaConvert  pads  the   output   audio
                                      streams  with  silence  or trims them to
                                      ensure that the total duration  of  each
                                      audio  stream is at least as long as the
                                      total  duration  of  the  video  stream.
                                      After  padding  or  trimming,  the audio
                                      stream duration  is  no  more  than  one
                                      frame  longer  than  the  video  stream.
                                      MediaConvert applies  audio  padding  or
                                      trimming  only  to  the  end of the last
                                      segment of the output.  For  unsegmented
                                      outputs,  MediaConvert adds padding only
                                      to the end of the file.  When  you  keep
                                      the  default value, any minor discrepan-
                                      cies between audio  and  video  duration
                                      will  depend on your output audio codec.

                                   AudioGroupId -> (string)
                                      Specify the audio  rendition  group  for
                                      this  audio rendition. Specify up to one
                                      value for each audio output in your out-
                                      put  group.  This  value appears in your
                                      HLS parent manifest in  the  EXT-X-MEDIA
                                      tag  of TYPE=AUDIO, as the value for the
                                      GROUP-ID attribute. For example, if  you
                                      specify  "audio_aac_1"  for  Audio group
                                      ID, it appears  in  your  manifest  like
                                      this:
                                      #EXT-X-MEDIA:TYPE=AUDIO,GROUP-ID="audio_aac_1".

                                   AudioRenditionSets -> (string)
                                      List the audio rendition groups that you
                                      want included with this video rendition.
                                      Use a comma-separated list. For example,
                                      say you want to include the audio rendi-
                                      tion groups that have  the  audio  group
                                      IDs   "audio_aac_1"  and  "audio_dolby".
                                      Then  you  would  specify  this   value:
                                      "audio_aac_1,audio_dolby".  Related set-

                                      group ID, MediaConvert puts  each  audio

                                      and associates it with every video vari-
                                      ant.  Each value in your list appears in
                                      your  HLS   parent   manifest   in   the
                                      EXT-X-STREAM-INF  tag  as  the value for
                                      the AUDIO  attribute.  To  continue  the
                                      previous example, say that the file name

                                      rendition   is   "amazing_video_1.m3u8".
                                      Then,  in  your  parent  manifest,  each
                                      value  will  appear  on  separate lines,
                                      like                               this:

                                   IFrameOnlyManifest -> (string)
                                      Choose Include (INCLUDE) to have  Media-
                                      Convert  generate  an HLS child manifest
                                      that lists only the  I-frames  for  this
                                      rendition,  in  addition to your regular
                                      manifest for this rendition.  You  might
                                      use  this manifest as part of a workflow
                                      that creates preview functions for  your
                                      video.   MediaConvert   adds   both  the
                                      I-frame only child manifest and the reg-
                                      ular  child manifest to the parent mani-
                                      fest. When you don't  need  the  I-frame
                                      only  child  manifest,  keep the default
                                      value Exclude (EXCLUDE).

                                   Scte35Esam -> (string)
                                      Use this setting only when  you  specify
                                      SCTE-35 markers from ESAM. Choose INSERT
                                      to put SCTE-35 markers in this output at
                                      the insertion points that you specify in
                                      an ESAM XML document. Provide the  docu-
                                      ment in the setting SCC XML (sccXml).

                                   Scte35Source -> (string)
                                      Ignore  this  setting  unless  you  have
                                      SCTE-35  markers  in  your  input  video
                                      file.  Choose  Passthrough (PASSTHROUGH)
                                      if you want SCTE-35 markers that  appear
                                      in  your  input  to  also appear in this
                                      output. Choose None (NONE) if you  don't
                                      want  those SCTE-35 markers in this out-
                                      put.

                                   TimedMetadata -> (string)
                                      Applies to CMAF outputs. Use  this  set-
                                      ting  to  specify  whether  the  service
                                      inserts the ID3 timed metadata from  the
                                      input in this output.

                               Container -> (string)
                                   Container  for this output. Some containers
                                   require a container settings object. If not
                                   specified,  the default object will be cre-
                                   ated.

                               F4vSettings -> (structure)

                                   MoovPlacement -> (string)
                                      If set to PROGRESSIVE_DOWNLOAD, the MOOV
                                      atom  is  relocated  to the beginning of
                                      the archive as required for  progressive
                                      downloading. Otherwise it is placed nor-
                                      mally at the end.

                               M2tsSettings -> (structure)
                                   MPEG-2 TS container settings.  These  apply
                                   to  outputs in a File output group when the
                                   output's   container   (ContainerType)   is
                                   MPEG-2  Transport  Stream  (M2TS). In these
                                   assets, data is organized  by  the  program
                                   map table (PMT). Each transport stream pro-
                                   gram contains subsets  of  data,  including
                                   audio,  video,  and metadata. Each of these
                                   subsets  of  data  has  a  numerical  label
                                   called  a  packet  identifier  (PID).  Each
                                   transport stream program corresponds to one
                                   MediaConvert  output.  The  PMT  lists  the
                                   types of data in a program along with their
                                   PID. Downstream systems and players use the
                                   program map table to look up  the  PID  for
                                   each type of data it accesses and then uses
                                   the PIDs to locate specific data within the
                                   asset.

                                   AudioBufferModel -> (string)
                                      Selects  between the DVB and ATSC buffer
                                      models for Dolby Digital audio.

                                   AudioDuration -> (string)
                                      Specify this setting only when your out-
                                      put  will  be  consumed  by a downstream
                                      repackaging workflow that  is  sensitive
                                      to   very   small  duration  differences
                                      between video and audio. For this situa-
                                      tion,   choose   Match   video  duration
                                      (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION).  In  all   other
                                      cases,  keep  the default value, Default
                                      codec duration (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION).
                                      When  you  choose  Match video duration,
                                      MediaConvert  pads  the   output   audio
                                      streams  with  silence  or trims them to
                                      ensure that the total duration  of  each
                                      audio  stream is at least as long as the
                                      total  duration  of  the  video  stream.
                                      After  padding  or  trimming,  the audio
                                      stream duration  is  no  more  than  one
                                      frame  longer  than  the  video  stream.
                                      MediaConvert applies  audio  padding  or
                                      trimming  only  to  the  end of the last
                                      segment of the output.  For  unsegmented
                                      outputs,  MediaConvert adds padding only
                                      to the end of the file.  When  you  keep
                                      the  default value, any minor discrepan-
                                      cies between audio  and  video  duration
                                      will  depend on your output audio codec.

                                   AudioFramesPerPes -> (integer)
                                      The number of audio frames to insert for
                                      each PES packet.

                                   AudioPids -> (list)
                                      Specify  the  packet  identifiers (PIDs)
                                      for any  elementary  audio  streams  you
                                      include in this output. Specify multiple
                                      PIDs as a JSON  array.  Default  is  the
                                      range 482-492.

                                      (integer)

                                   Bitrate -> (integer)
                                      Specify the output bitrate of the trans-
                                      port stream in bits per second.  Setting
                                      to 0 lets the muxer automatically deter-
                                      mine the appropriate bitrate. Other com-
                                      mon  values  are  3750000,  7500000, and
                                      15000000.

                                   BufferModel -> (string)
                                      Controls what buffer model  to  use  for
                                      accurate  interleaving. If set to MULTI-
                                      PLEX, use multiplex buffer model. If set
                                      to NONE, this can lead to lower latency,
                                      but low-memory devices may not  be  able
                                      to  play  back the stream without inter-
                                      ruptions.

                                   DataPTSControl -> (string)
                                      If you select ALIGN_TO_VIDEO,  MediaCon-
                                      vert  writes  captions  and data packets
                                      with Presentation Timestamp (PTS) values
                                      greater than or equal to the first video
                                      packet PTS (MediaConvert drops  captions

                                      ues). Keep the default value  (AUTO)  to
                                      allow all PTS values.

                                   DvbNitSettings -> (structure)
                                      Use  these settings to insert a DVB Net-

                                      When set  to  VIDEO_AND_FIXED_INTERVALS,
                                      audio  EBP markers will be added to par-
                                      titions 3 and 4.  The  interval  between
                                      these  additional markers will be fixed,
                                      and will be slightly  shorter  than  the
                                      video  EBP  marker interval. When set to

                                      on.  They  can  either be placed only on
                                      the video PID, or on both the video  PID
                                      and all audio PIDs. Only applicable when
                                      EBP segmentation markers are is selected
                                      (segmentationMarkers     is    EBP    or

                                      you know that your audio EBP markers are
                                      incorrectly  appearing before your video
                                      EBP markers. To  correct  this  problem,
                                      set this value to Force (FORCE).

                                   FragmentTime -> (double)
                                      The  length,  in  seconds, of each frag-
                                      ment. Only used with EBP markers.

                                   MaxPcrInterval -> (integer)
                                      Specify the maximum time,  in  millisec-
                                      onds,  between  Program Clock References
                                      (PCRs)  inserted  into   the   transport
                                      stream.

                                   MinEbpInterval -> (integer)
                                      When set, enforces that Encoder Boundary
                                      Points do not come within the  specified
                                      time  interval  of each other by looking
                                      ahead at input video. If another EBP  is
                                      going  to  come  in within the specified
                                      time interval, the current  EBP  is  not
                                      emitted,  and the segment is "stretched"
                                      to the next marker. The lookahead  value
                                      does  not add latency to the system. The
                                      Live Event must be configured  elsewhere
                                      to create sufficient latency to make the
                                      lookahead accurate.

                                   NielsenId3 -> (string)
                                      If INSERT, Nielsen inaudible  tones  for

                                      input audio and an  equivalent  ID3  tag
                                      will be inserted in the output.

                                   NullPacketBitrate -> (double)
                                      Value  in  bits per second of extra null
                                      packets to  insert  into  the  transport
                                      stream. This can be used if a downstream
                                      encryption system requires periodic null
                                      packets.

                                      transport stream.

                                   PcrControl -> (string)
                                      When set to PCR_EVERY_PES_PACKET, a Pro-
                                      gram Clock Reference value  is  inserted
                                      for  every  Packetized Elementary Stream
                                      (PES) header.  This  is  effective  only
                                      when  the  PCR  PID  is  the same as the
                                      video or audio elementary stream.

                                   PcrPid -> (integer)

                                      this output. If you  do  not  specify  a
                                      value,  the  service  will use the value
                                      for Video PID (VideoPid).

                                   PmtInterval -> (integer)

                                      ble  (PMT)  in  the   output   transport
                                      stream.

                                   PmtPid -> (integer)

                                      the  program  map  table  (PMT)  itself.
                                      Default is 480.

                                   PrivateMetadataPid -> (integer)
                                      Specify  the  packet identifier (PID) of
                                      the private metadata stream. Default  is
                                      503.

                                      program map table (PMT) for this output.
                                      Default is 1. Program numbers  and  pro-
                                      gram  map  tables  are  parts  of MPEG-2
                                      transport stream  containers,  used  for
                                      organizing data.

                                   RateMode -> (string)
                                      When  set  to  CBR, inserts null packets
                                      into transport stream to fill  specified
                                      bitrate.  When  set  to VBR, the bitrate
                                      setting acts as the maximum bitrate, but
                                      the output will not be padded up to that
                                      bitrate.

                                   SegmentationStyle -> (string)
                                      The  segmentation  style  parameter con-
                                      trols  how  segmentation   markers   are
                                      inserted into the transport stream. With
                                      avails, it is possible that segments may
                                      be  truncated, which can influence where
                                      future    segmentation    markers    are
                                      inserted.  When  a segmentation style of
                                      "reset_cadence" is selected and  a  seg-
                                      ment  is  truncated  due to an avail, we
                                      will  reset  the  segmentation  cadence.
                                      This  means  the subsequent segment will
                                      have a duration of of $segmentation_time
                                      seconds.  When  a  segmentation style of
                                      "maintain_cadence"  is  selected  and  a
                                      segment is truncated due to an avail, we
                                      will not reset the segmentation cadence.
                                      This  means  the subsequent segment will
                                      likely be truncated  as  well.  However,
                                      all  segments  after  that  will  have a
                                      duration of $segmentation_time  seconds.
                                      Note  that  EBP  lookahead  is  a slight
                                      exception to this rule.

                                   SegmentationTime -> (double)
                                      Specify the length, in seconds, of  each
                                      segment.  Required unless markers is set
                                      to _none_.

                                   TimedMetadataPid -> (integer)
                                      Specify the packet identifier (PID)  for
                                      timed  metadata  in this output. Default
                                      is 502.

                                   TransportStreamId -> (integer)
                                      Specify the ID for the transport  stream
                                      itself in the program map table for this
                                      output. Transport stream IDs and program
                                      map tables are parts of MPEG-2 transport
                                      stream containers, used  for  organizing
                                      data.

                                   VideoPid -> (integer)
                                      Specify  the  packet identifier (PID) of
                                      the  elementary  video  stream  in   the
                                      transport stream.

                               M3u8Settings -> (structure)
                                   These  settings relate to the MPEG-2 trans-
                                   port stream (MPEG2-TS)  container  for  the
                                   MPEG2-TS segments in your HLS outputs.

                                   AudioDuration -> (string)
                                      Specify this setting only when your out-
                                      put will be  consumed  by  a  downstream
                                      repackaging  workflow  that is sensitive
                                      to  very  small   duration   differences
                                      between video and audio. For this situa-
                                      tion,  choose   Match   video   duration
                                      (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION).   In  all  other
                                      cases, keep the default  value,  Default
                                      codec duration (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION).
                                      When you choose  Match  video  duration,
                                      MediaConvert   pads   the  output  audio
                                      streams with silence or  trims  them  to
                                      ensure  that  the total duration of each
                                      audio stream is at least as long as  the
                                      total  duration  of  the  video  stream.
                                      After padding  or  trimming,  the  audio
                                      stream  duration  is  no  more  than one
                                      frame  longer  than  the  video  stream.
                                      MediaConvert  applies  audio  padding or
                                      trimming only to the  end  of  the  last
                                      segment  of  the output. For unsegmented
                                      outputs, MediaConvert adds padding  only
                                      to  the  end  of the file. When you keep
                                      the default value, any minor  discrepan-
                                      cies  between  audio  and video duration
                                      will depend on your output audio  codec.

                                      stream. Multiple  values  are  accepted,
                                      and  can  be entered in ranges and/or by
                                      comma separation.

                                      est)  box  will  be included per 14496-1
                                      amendment 1. This improves compatibility
                                      with Apple players and tools.

                                   Mpeg2FourCCControl -> (string)
                                      When  set  to  XDCAM, writes MPEG2 video
                                      streams into the  QuickTime  file  using
                                      XDCAM  fourcc codes. This increases com-
                                      patibility with Apple editors and  play-
                                      ers, but may decrease compatibility with
                                      other players. Only applicable when  the
                                      video codec is MPEG2.

                                   PaddingControl -> (string)
                                      To  make  this  output  compatible  with
                                      Omenon, keep the default value,  OMNEON.
                                      Unless  you  need  Omneon compatibility,
                                      set this value to NONE.  When  you  keep
                                      the  default value, OMNEON, MediaConvert
                                      increases the length of  the  edit  list
                                      atom.  This  might cause file rejections
                                      when a  recipient  of  the  output  file
                                      doesn't expct this extra padding.

                                   Reference -> (string)
                                      Always keep the default value (SELF_CON-
                                      TAINED) for this setting.

                                   AudioDuration -> (string)
                                      Specify this setting only when your out-
                                      put will be  consumed  by  a  downstream
                                      repackaging  workflow  that is sensitive
                                      to  very  small   duration   differences
                                      between video and audio. For this situa-
                                      tion,  choose   Match   video   duration
                                      (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION).   In  all  other
                                      cases, keep the default  value,  Default
                                      codec duration (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION).
                                      When you choose  Match  video  duration,
                                      MediaConvert   pads   the  output  audio
                                      streams with silence or  trims  them  to
                                      ensure  that  the total duration of each
                                      audio stream is at least as long as  the
                                      total  duration  of  the  video  stream.
                                      After padding  or  trimming,  the  audio
                                      stream  duration  is  no  more  than one
                                      frame  longer  than  the  video  stream.
                                      MediaConvert  applies  audio  padding or
                                      trimming only to the  end  of  the  last
                                      segment  of  the output. For unsegmented
                                      outputs, MediaConvert adds padding  only
                                      to  the  end  of the file. When you keep
                                      the default value, any minor  discrepan-
                                      cies  between  audio  and video duration
                                      will depend on your output audio  codec.

                                   CslgAtom -> (string)
                                      When  enabled,  file  composition  times
                                      will start at zero, composition times in
                                      the  'ctts' (composition time to sample)
                                      box for B-frames will be negative, and a
                                      'cslg'  (composition  shift least great-
                                      est) box will be  included  per  14496-1

                                   CttsVersion -> (integer)
                                      Ignore this setting unless compliance to
                                      the  CTTS box version specification mat-
                                      ters in your workflow. Specify  a  value
                                      of  1  to set your CTTS box version to 1
                                      and make your output compliant with  the
                                      specification.  When you specify a value
                                      of 1, you must also set CSLG atom  (csl-
                                      gAtom)  to  the  value INCLUDE. Keep the
                                      default value 0 to  set  your  CTTS  box
                                      version  to 0. This can provide backward
                                      compatibility for some players and pack-
                                      agers.

                                      required, but some video players require
                                      it  to  discover  and  play embedded 608
                                      captions.  Keep   the   default   value,

                                      frame  longer  than  the  video  stream.
                                      MediaConvert applies  audio  padding  or
                                      trimming  only  to  the  end of the last
                                      segment of the output.  For  unsegmented
                                      outputs,  MediaConvert adds padding only
                                      to the end of the file.  When  you  keep
                                      the  default value, any minor discrepan-
                                      cies between audio  and  video  duration
                                      will  depend on your output audio codec.

                                          1492 bytes per frame. This should be
                                          sufficient   to   prevent   overflow
                                          unless  you  have  multiple pages of
                                          teletext captions data. If you  have

                               Use Extension (Extension) to specify  the  file
                               extension for outputs in File output groups. If
                               you do not specify a value,  the  service  will

                            NameModifier -> (string)
                               Use Name modifier (NameModifier)  to  have  the
                               service  add a string to the end of each output
                               filename. You specify the base filename as part
                               of your destination URI. When you create multi-
                               ple outputs in the same output group, Name mod-
                               ifier (NameModifier) is required. Name modifier
                               also accepts format identifiers. For  DASH  ISO
                               outputs,  if  you  use  the  format identifiers
                               $Number$ or $Time$ in one output, you must  use
                               them in the same way in all outputs of the out-

                                   SegmentModifier -> (string)
                                      Use  this  setting to add an identifying
                                      string to the filename of each  segment.
                                      The service adds this string between the

                               your  transcoding  settings. Provide the system
                               or custom preset name. You can  specify  either

                               encoding  settings. The specific video settings
                               depend on the video codec that you  choose  for
                               the  property  codec.  Include  one instance of

                                   and MPEG2 outputs. Use Insert AFD signaling
                                   (AfdSignaling) to specify whether the  ser-
                                   vice  includes  AFD  values  in  the output
                                   video data and what  those  values  are.  *
                                   Choose  None  to remove all AFD values from
                                   this output. * Choose Fixed to ignore input
                                   AFD  values  and  instead  encode the value
                                   specified in the job. * Choose Auto to cal-
                                   culate output AFD values based on the input
                                   AFD scaler data.

                               AntiAlias -> (string)
                                   The  anti-alias  filter  is   automatically
                                   applied  to  all  outputs.  The  service no
                                   longer  accepts  the  value  DISABLED   for
                                   AntiAlias. If you specify that in your job,
                                   the service will ignore the setting.

                               CodecSettings -> (structure)
                                   Video codec settings, (CodecSettings) under
                                   (VideoDescription),  contains  the group of
                                   settings related  to  video  encoding.  The
                                   settings  in  this  group vary depending on
                                   the value that you choose for  Video  codec
                                   (Codec).  For  each  codec  enum  that  you
                                   choose, define the  corresponding  settings
                                   object. The following lists the codec enum,

                                      FramerateControl -> (string)
                                          If  you  are  using the console, use
                                          the Framerate setting to specify the
                                          frame  rate  for this output. If you
                                          want to keep the same frame rate  as
                                          the   input   video,  choose  Follow
                                          source. If you want to do frame rate
                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the dropdown list or choose  Custom.
                                          The framerates shown in the dropdown
                                          list are decimal  approximations  of
                                          fractions.  If  you  choose  Custom,
                                          specify your frame rate as  a  frac-
                                          tion.   If  you  are  creating  your
                                          transcoding job specification  as  a
                                          JSON  file  without the console, use
                                          FramerateControl  to  specify  which
                                          value the service uses for the frame
                                          rate for this  output.  Choose  INI-
                                          TIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE  if you want the
                                          service to use the frame  rate  from
                                          the  input.  Choose SPECIFIED if you
                                          want the service to  use  the  frame
                                          rate  you  specify  in  the settings
                                          FramerateNumerator and  FramerateDe-

                                      FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                          Choose  the  method  that  you  want
                                          MediaConvert  to use when increasing
                                          or decreasing  the  frame  rate.  We
                                          recommend   using   drop   duplicate
                                          (DUPLICATE_DROP)   for   numerically
                                          simple  conversions,  such as 60 fps
                                          to 30 fps. For  numerically  complex
                                          conversions, you can use interpolate
                                          (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This
                                          results  in  a  smooth  picture, but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts.  For  complex  frame rate
                                          conversions,  especially   if   your
                                          source  video  has already been con-
                                          verted from  its  original  cadence,
                                          use  FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion method  frame  by  frame.  Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to specify the denominator  of  this
                                          fraction.  In this example, use 1001
                                          for the value of  FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor.  When  you  use the console for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976  fps.  Use FramerateNumerator
                                          to specify  the  numerator  of  this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When   you   use   the  console  for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      GopSize -> (double)
                                          Specify  the  GOP  length  (keyframe
                                          interval) in frames. With AV1, Medi-
                                          aConvert  doesn't support GOP length
                                          in  seconds.  This  value  must   be
                                          greater  than  zero  and  preferably
                                          equal to 1 + ((numberBFrames + 1)  *
                                          x), where x is an integer value.

                                      MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                          Maximum  bitrate in bits/second. For
                                          example,  enter  five  megabits  per
                                          second  as  5000000.  Required  when
                                          Rate control mode is QVBR.

                                      NumberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames   ->
                                      (integer)
                                          Specify from the number of B-frames,
                                          in the range of 0-15. For AV1 encod-
                                          ing,  we  recommend  using  7 or 15.
                                          Choose a larger number for  a  lower
                                          bitrate   and   smaller  file  size;
                                          choose a smaller number  for  better
                                          video quality.

                                      QvbrSettings -> (structure)
                                          Settings  for  quality-defined vari-

                                          codec.  Use these settings only when
                                          you set QVBR for Rate  control  mode
                                          (RateControlMode).

                                          QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                                             Use  this  setting  only when you
                                             set Rate control  mode  (RateCon-
                                             trolMode)  to  QVBR.  Specify the
                                             target  quality  level  for  this
                                             output.  MediaConvert  determines
                                             the right number of bits  to  use
                                             for  each  part  of  the video to
                                             maintain the video  quality  that
                                             you  specify.  When  you keep the
                                             default value, AUTO, MediaConvert
                                             picks  a  quality  level for you,
                                             based on characteristics of  your
                                             input  video.  If  you  prefer to
                                             specify a quality level,  specify
                                             a  number  from 1 through 10. Use
                                             higher numbers for greater  qual-
                                             ity.  Level  10 results in nearly
                                             lossless compression. The quality
                                             level  for most broadcast-quality
                                             transcodes is between  6  and  9.
                                             Optionally,  to  specify  a value

                                             example,  if  you  want your QVBR
                                             quality level  to  be  7.33,  set
                                             qvbrQualityLevel  to  7  and  set
                                             qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to  .33.

                                          QvbrQualityLevelFineTune -> (double)
                                             Optional. Specify a value here to
                                             set  the  QVBR quality to a level
                                             that is  between  whole  numbers.
                                             For  example,  if  you  want your
                                             QVBR quality level  to  be  7.33,
                                             set qvbrQualityLevel to 7 and set
                                             qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to  .33.
                                             MediaConvert   rounds  your  QVBR
                                             quality  level  to  the   nearest
                                             third  of  a  whole  number.  For
                                             example,  if  you  set  qvbrQual-
                                             ityLevel   to   7   and  you  set
                                             qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to  .25,
                                             your actual QVBR quality level is
                                             7.33.

                                      RateControlMode -> (string)

                                          Specify  the  number  of  slices per
                                          picture. This value must be 1, 2, 4,
                                          8,  16,  or 32. For progressive pic-

                                          or equal to the number of macroblock
                                          rows. For interlaced pictures,  this
                                          value  must be less than or equal to
                                          half the number of macroblock  rows.

                                          When  you  enable  this feature, the
                                          encoder uses  fewer  bits  on  areas
                                          that  can  sustain  more  distortion
                                          with no noticeable  visual  degrada-
                                          tion  and  uses  more  bits on areas
                                          where any small distortion  will  be
                                          noticeable.   For  example,  complex
                                          textured  blocks  are  encoded  with
                                          fewer   bits   and  smooth  textured
                                          blocks are encoded with  more  bits.
                                          Enabling  this  feature  will almost
                                          always improve your  video  quality.
                                          Note,   though,  that  this  feature
                                          doesn't take into account where  the

                                          class  values  have  higher bitrates
                                          and  improved  image  quality.  Note
                                          that  for  Class 4K/2K, MediaConvert

                                             Multi-pass   (MULTI_PASS),   your
                                             video  quality is better and your
                                             output bitrate is more  accurate.
                                             That  is,  the  actual bitrate of

                                             gle-pass    (SINGLE_PASS),   your
                                             encoding  time  is  faster.   The
                                             default  behavior  is Single-pass
                                             (SINGLE_PASS).

                                      FramerateControl -> (string)
                                          If you are using  the  console,  use
                                          the Framerate setting to specify the
                                          frame rate for this output.  If  you
                                          want  to keep the same frame rate as
                                          the  input  video,   choose   Follow
                                          source. If you want to do frame rate
                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the  dropdown list or choose Custom.
                                          The framerates shown in the dropdown
                                          list  are  decimal approximations of
                                          fractions.  If  you  choose  Custom,
                                          specify  your  frame rate as a frac-
                                          tion.  If  you  are  creating   your
                                          transcoding  job  specification as a
                                          JSON file without the  console,  use
                                          FramerateControl  to  specify  which
                                          value the service uses for the frame
                                          rate  for  this  output. Choose INI-
                                          TIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE if you want  the
                                          service  to  use the frame rate from
                                          the input. Choose SPECIFIED  if  you
                                          want  the  service  to use the frame
                                          rate you  specify  in  the  settings
                                          FramerateNumerator  and FramerateDe-
                                          nominator.

                                      FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                          Choose  the  method  that  you  want
                                          MediaConvert to use when  increasing
                                          or  decreasing  the  frame  rate. We
                                          recommend   using   drop   duplicate
                                          (DUPLICATE_DROP)   for   numerically
                                          simple conversions, such as  60  fps
                                          to  30  fps. For numerically complex
                                          conversions, you can use interpolate
                                          (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This
                                          results in  a  smooth  picture,  but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts. For  complex  frame  rate
                                          conversions,   especially   if  your
                                          source video has already  been  con-
                                          verted  from  its  original cadence,
                                          use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to  do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion  method  frame  by  frame. Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding  time  and incurs a sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to  specify  the denominator of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use  1001
                                          for  the value of FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor. When you use  the  console  for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps.  Use  FramerateNumerator
                                          to  specify  the  numerator  of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When  you  use   the   console   for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                          Choose the scan line  type  for  the
                                          output. Keep the default value, Pro-
                                          gressive (PROGRESSIVE) to  create  a
                                          progressive  output,  regardless  of
                                          the scan type of your input. Use Top
                                          field  first  (TOP_FIELD)  or Bottom
                                          field first (BOTTOM_FIELD) to create
                                          an output that's interlaced with the
                                          same field polarity throughout.  Use
                                          Follow,     default     top    (FOL-
                                          LOW_TOP_FIELD)  or  Follow,  default
                                          bottom (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to pro-
                                          duce outputs  with  the  same  field
                                          polarity  as  the  source.  For jobs
                                          that have multiple inputs, the  out-
                                          put field polarity might change over
                                          the course  of  the  output.  Follow
                                          behavior  depends  on the input scan
                                          type. If the source  is  interlaced,
                                          the  output  will be interlaced with
                                          the same polarity as the source.  If
                                          the  source is progressive, the out-
                                          put  will  be  interlaced  with  top
                                          field  bottom field first, depending

                                      FlickerAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                                          Only   use  this  setting  when  you
                                          change the default value, AUTO,  for

                                          and all other adaptive  quantization
                                          from  your  JSON  job specification,
                                          MediaConvert  automatically  applies
                                          the  best  types of quantization for
                                          your video  content.  When  you  set
                                          H264AdaptiveQuantization  to a value
                                          other than AUTO, the  default  value
                                          for  H264FlickerAdaptiveQuantization
                                          is Disabled (DISABLED). Change  this
                                          value to Enabled (ENABLED) to reduce
                                          I-frame pop. I-frame pop appears  as
                                          a visual flicker that can arise when
                                          the encoder saves  bits  by  copying
                                          some  macroblocks  many  times  from
                                          frame to frame, and  then  refreshes
                                          them at the I-frame. When you enable
                                          this setting,  the  encoder  updates
                                          these   macroblocks   slightly  more
                                          often to smooth out the flicker.  To
                                          manually     enable    or    disable
                                          H264FlickerAdaptiveQuantization, you
                                          must   set   Adaptive   quantization

                                      FramerateControl -> (string)
                                          If  you  are  using the console, use
                                          the Framerate setting to specify the
                                          frame  rate  for this output. If you
                                          want to keep the same frame rate  as
                                          the   input   video,  choose  Follow
                                          source. If you want to do frame rate
                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the dropdown list or choose  Custom.
                                          The framerates shown in the dropdown
                                          list are decimal  approximations  of
                                          fractions.  If  you  choose  Custom,
                                          specify your frame rate as  a  frac-
                                          tion.   If  you  are  creating  your
                                          transcoding job specification  as  a
                                          JSON  file  without the console, use
                                          FramerateControl  to  specify  which
                                          value the service uses for the frame
                                          rate for this  output.  Choose  INI-
                                          TIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE  if you want the
                                          service to use the frame  rate  from
                                          the  input.  Choose SPECIFIED if you
                                          want the service to  use  the  frame
                                          rate  you  specify  in  the settings
                                          FramerateNumerator and  FramerateDe-

                                      FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                          Choose  the  method  that  you  want
                                          MediaConvert  to use when increasing
                                          or decreasing  the  frame  rate.  We
                                          recommend   using   drop   duplicate
                                          (DUPLICATE_DROP)   for   numerically
                                          simple  conversions,  such as 60 fps
                                          to 30 fps. For  numerically  complex
                                          conversions, you can use interpolate
                                          (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This
                                          results  in  a  smooth  picture, but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts.  For  complex  frame rate
                                          conversions,  especially   if   your
                                          source  video  has already been con-
                                          verted from  its  original  cadence,
                                          use  FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion method  frame  by  frame.  Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to specify the denominator  of  this
                                          fraction.  In this example, use 1001
                                          for the value of  FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor.  When  you  use the console for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976  fps.  Use FramerateNumerator
                                          to specify  the  numerator  of  this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When   you   use   the  console  for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      GopBReference -> (string)
                                          If  enable,  use  reference B frames
                                          for  GOP  structures  that  have   B
                                          frames > 1.

                                      GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                                          Specify  the  relative  frequency of
                                          open to closed GOPs in this  output.
                                          For  example,  if  you want to allow
                                          four open GOPs and  then  require  a
                                          closed  GOP, set this value to 5. We
                                          recommend   that   you   have    the
                                          transcoder automatically choose this
                                          value for you based on  characteris-
                                          tics  of your input video. To enable
                                          this automatic  behavior,  keep  the
                                          default  value  by leaving this set-
                                          ting out of your JSON job specifica-
                                          tion.  In  the  console,  do this by
                                          keeping the default empty value.  If
                                          you  do  explicitly specify a value,
                                          for  segmented  outputs,  don't  set
                                          this value to 0.

                                      GopSize -> (double)
                                          Use  this  setting only when you set
                                          GOP mode control  (GopSizeUnits)  to
                                          Specified, frames (FRAMES) or Speci-
                                          fied, seconds (SECONDS). Specify the
                                          GOP  length  using a whole number of
                                          frames or a decimal  value  of  sec-
                                          onds.  MediaConvert  will  interpret
                                          this  value  as  frames  or  seconds
                                          depending  on  the  value you choose
                                          for GOP mode control (GopSizeUnits).
                                          If you want to allow MediaConvert to
                                          automatically  determine  GOP  size,
                                          leave  GOP  size  blank  and set GOP
                                          mode control to Auto (AUTO). If your
                                          output group specifies HLS, DASH, or
                                          CMAF, leave GOP size blank  and  set

                                      GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                                          Specify how  the  transcoder  deter-
                                          mines  GOP  size for this output. We
                                          recommend   that   you   have    the
                                          transcoder automatically choose this
                                          value for you based on  characteris-
                                          tics  of your input video. To enable
                                          this automatic behavior, choose Auto
                                          (AUTO)  and and leave GOP size (Gop-
                                          Size)  blank.  By  default,  if  you
                                          don't specify GOP mode control (Gop-
                                          SizeUnits),  MediaConvert  will  use
                                          automatic  behavior.  If your output
                                          group specifies HLS, DASH, or  CMAF,
                                          set  GOP  mode  control  to Auto and
                                          leave GOP size blank in each  output
                                          in  your output group. To explicitly
                                          specify the GOP length, choose Spec-
                                          ified, frames (FRAMES) or Specified,
                                          seconds (SECONDS) and  then  provide
                                          the  GOP  length in the related set-
                                          ting GOP size (GopSize).

                                      HrdBufferInitialFillPercentage -> (inte-
                                      ger)
                                          Percentage of the buffer that should
                                          initially  be  filled  (HRD   buffer
                                          model).

                                      HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                                          Size of buffer (HRD buffer model) in
                                          bits.  For   example,   enter   five
                                          megabits as 5000000.

                                      InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                          Choose  the  scan  line type for the
                                          output. Keep the default value, Pro-
                                          gressive  (PROGRESSIVE)  to create a
                                          progressive  output,  regardless  of
                                          the scan type of your input. Use Top
                                          field first  (TOP_FIELD)  or  Bottom
                                          field first (BOTTOM_FIELD) to create
                                          an output that's interlaced with the
                                          same  field polarity throughout. Use
                                          Follow,    default     top     (FOL-
                                          LOW_TOP_FIELD)  or  Follow,  default
                                          bottom (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to pro-
                                          duce  outputs  with  the  same field
                                          polarity as  the  source.  For  jobs
                                          that  have multiple inputs, the out-
                                          put field polarity might change over
                                          the  course  of  the  output. Follow
                                          behavior depends on the  input  scan
                                          type.  If  the source is interlaced,
                                          the output will be  interlaced  with
                                          the  same polarity as the source. If
                                          the source is progressive, the  out-
                                          put  will  be  interlaced  with  top
                                          field bottom field first,  depending
                                          on  which  of the Follow options you
                                          choose.

                                      MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                          Maximum bitrate in bits/second.  For
                                          example,  enter  five  megabits  per
                                          second  as  5000000.  Required  when
                                          Rate control mode is QVBR.

                                      MinIInterval -> (integer)
                                          Use  this setting only when you also
                                          enable   Scene   change    detection
                                          (SceneChangeDetect).   This  setting
                                          determines how the  encoder  manages
                                          the spacing between I-frames that it
                                          inserts  as  part  of  the   I-frame
                                          cadence  and  the  I-frames  that it
                                          inserts for Scene change  detection.
                                          We   recommend  that  you  have  the
                                          transcoder automatically choose this
                                          value  for you based on characteris-
                                          tics of your input video. To  enable
                                          this  automatic  behavior,  keep the
                                          default value by leaving  this  set-
                                          ting out of your JSON job specifica-
                                          tion. In the  console,  do  this  by
                                          keeping  the  default  empty  value.
                                          When you explicitly specify a  value
                                          for this setting, the encoder deter-
                                          mines    whether    to    skip     a
                                          cadence-driven  I-frame by the value
                                          you set. For example, if you set Min
                                          I interval (minIInterval) to 5 and a
                                          cadence-driven  I-frame  would  fall
                                          within  5  frames  of a scene-change
                                          I-frame, then the encoder skips  the
                                          cadence-driven I-frame. In this way,
                                          one GOP is shrunk slightly  and  one
                                          GOP  is stretched slightly. When the
                                          cadence-driven I-frames are  farther
                                          from  the  scene-change I-frame than
                                          the value you set, then the  encoder
                                          leaves all I-frames in place and the
                                          GOPs surrounding  the  scene  change
                                          are  smaller  than the usual cadence
                                          GOPs.

                                      NumberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames   ->
                                      (integer)
                                          This  setting to determines the num-
                                          ber of  B-frames  that  MediaConvert
                                          puts  between  reference  frames  in
                                          this output. We recommend  that  you
                                          use  automatic behavior to allow the
                                          transcoder to choose the best  value
                                          based  on  characteristics  of  your
                                          input video. In the console,  choose
                                          AUTO to select this automatic behav-
                                          ior. When  you  manually  edit  your
                                          JSON  job  specification, leave this
                                          setting  out  to  choose   automatic
                                          behavior.  When  you want to specify
                                          this  number  explicitly,  choose  a
                                          whole number from 0 through 7.

                                      NumberReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                                          Number  of  reference frames to use.
                                          The  encoder  may  use   more   than
                                          requested  if  using B-frames and/or
                                          interlaced encoding.

                                      ParControl -> (string)
                                          Optional. Specify  how  the  service
                                          determines  the  pixel  aspect ratio
                                          (PAR) for this output.  The  default
                                          behavior,  Follow  source  (INITIAL-
                                          IZE_FROM_SOURCE), uses the PAR  from
                                          your input video for your output. To
                                          specify a different PAR in the  con-
                                          sole,  choose  any  value other than
                                          Follow source. To specify a  differ-
                                          ent  PAR  by  editing  the  JSON job
                                          specification,   choose   SPECIFIED.
                                          When  you  choose SPECIFIED for this
                                          setting, you must also specify  val-
                                          ues  for the parNumerator and parDe-
                                          nominator settings.

                                      ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                          Required when you set  Pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (parControl) to SPECIFIED. On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you specify an output  pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (PAR)  that is different from
                                          your input video PAR,  provide  your
                                          output  PAR as a ratio. For example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify  the  ratio  40:33.  In this
                                          example, the value for  parDenomina-
                                          tor is 33.

                                      ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                          Required  when  you set Pixel aspect
                                          ratio (parControl) to SPECIFIED.  On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you  specify  an output pixel aspect
                                          ratio (PAR) that is  different  from
                                          your  input  video PAR, provide your
                                          output PAR as a ratio. For  example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the  ratio  40:33.  In  this
                                          example,  the value for parNumerator
                                          is 40.

                                      QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                          Optional. Use Quality  tuning  level

                                          you want to trade off encoding speed
                                          for   output   video   quality.  The
                                          default behavior  is  faster,  lower
                                          quality, single-pass encoding.

                                      QvbrSettings -> (structure)

                                          you set QVBR for Rate  control  mode
                                          (RateControlMode).

                                          MaxAverageBitrate -> (integer)
                                             Use  this  setting only when Rate

                                             is  less  than  or  equal  to the
                                             value you set multiplied  by  the

                                          QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                                             Use this setting  only  when  you
                                             set  Rate  control mode (RateCon-
                                             trolMode) to  QVBR.  Specify  the
                                             target  quality  level  for  this
                                             output.  MediaConvert  determines
                                             the  right  number of bits to use
                                             for each part  of  the  video  to
                                             maintain  the  video quality that
                                             you specify. When  you  keep  the
                                             default value, AUTO, MediaConvert
                                             picks a quality  level  for  you,
                                             based  on characteristics of your
                                             input video.  If  you  prefer  to
                                             specify  a quality level, specify
                                             a number from 1 through  10.  Use
                                             higher  numbers for greater qual-
                                             ity. Level 10 results  in  nearly
                                             lossless compression. The quality
                                             level for most  broadcast-quality
                                             transcodes  is  between  6 and 9.

                                             qvbrQualityLevelFineTune.     For
                                             example, if you  want  your  QVBR
                                             quality  level  to  be  7.33, set
                                             qvbrQualityLevel  to  7  and  set
                                             qvbrQualityLevelFineTune  to .33.

                                          QvbrQualityLevelFineTune -> (double)
                                             Optional. Specify a value here to
                                             set the QVBR quality to  a  level
                                             that  is  between  whole numbers.
                                             For example,  if  you  want  your
                                             QVBR  quality  level  to be 7.33,
                                             set qvbrQualityLevel to 7 and set
                                             qvbrQualityLevelFineTune  to .33.
                                             MediaConvert  rounds  your   QVBR

                                             third  of  a  whole  number.  For
                                             example,  if  you  set  qvbrQual-
                                             ityLevel  to  7   and   you   set
                                             qvbrQualityLevelFineTune  to .25,
                                             your actual QVBR quality level is
                                             7.33.

                                      RateControlMode -> (string)
                                          Use  this setting to specify whether
                                          this output has a  variable  bitrate
                                          (VBR),  constant  bitrate  (CBR)  or

                                          to comply with a specification  that
                                          requires  a  specific  value. If you

                                          ment,  we  recommend that you adjust
                                          the softness of your output by using
                                          a lower value for the setting Sharp-
                                          ness (sharpness) or  by  enabling  a

                                          H.264  specification. Choose a value
                                          from 17 to 128 to use planar  inter-
                                          polation.  Increasing values from 17
                                          to 128 result in  increasing  reduc-
                                          tion  of  high-frequency  data.  The
                                          value 128  results  in  the  softest

                                          (ENABLED).  Keep  this default value
                                          to adjust quantization  within  each
                                          frame  based on spatial variation of
                                          content complexity. When you  enable
                                          this feature, the encoder uses fewer
                                          bits on areas that can sustain  more
                                          distortion with no noticeable visual
                                          degradation and uses  more  bits  on
                                          areas  where  any  small  distortion
                                          will  be  noticeable.  For  example,
                                          complex  textured blocks are encoded
                                          with fewer bits and smooth  textured
                                          blocks  are  encoded with more bits.
                                          Enabling this  feature  will  almost
                                          always  improve  your video quality.
                                          Note,  though,  that  this   feature

                                      FlickerAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                                          Enable  this  setting  to  have  the
                                          encoder reduce I-frame pop.  I-frame
                                          pop appears as a visual flicker that
                                          can arise  when  the  encoder  saves
                                          bits  by  copying  some  macroblocks
                                          many times from frame to frame,  and
                                          then  refreshes them at the I-frame.
                                          When you enable  this  setting,  the
                                          encoder  updates  these  macroblocks
                                          slightly more often  to  smooth  out
                                          the  flicker.  This  setting is dis-

                                          Quantization  to  a value other than
                                          Off (OFF).

                                      FramerateControl -> (string)
                                          If you are using  the  console,  use
                                          the Framerate setting to specify the
                                          frame rate for this output.  If  you
                                          want  to keep the same frame rate as
                                          the  input  video,   choose   Follow
                                          source. If you want to do frame rate
                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the  dropdown list or choose Custom.
                                          The framerates shown in the dropdown
                                          list  are  decimal approximations of
                                          fractions.  If  you  choose  Custom,
                                          specify  your  frame rate as a frac-
                                          tion.  If  you  are  creating   your

                                          JSON file without the  console,  use
                                          FramerateControl  to  specify  which
                                          value the service uses for the frame
                                          rate  for  this  output. Choose INI-
                                          TIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE if you want  the
                                          service  to  use the frame rate from
                                          the input. Choose SPECIFIED  if  you
                                          want  the  service  to use the frame
                                          rate you  specify  in  the  settings
                                          FramerateNumerator  and FramerateDe-

                                      FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                          Choose  the  method  that  you  want
                                          MediaConvert to use when  increasing
                                          or  decreasing  the  frame  rate. We
                                          recommend   using   drop   duplicate
                                          (DUPLICATE_DROP)   for   numerically
                                          simple conversions, such as  60  fps
                                          to  30  fps. For numerically complex
                                          conversions, you can use interpolate
                                          (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This
                                          results in  a  smooth  picture,  but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts. For  complex  frame  rate
                                          conversions,   especially   if  your
                                          source video has already  been  con-
                                          verted  from  its  original cadence,
                                          use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to  do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion  method  frame  by  frame. Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding  time  and incurs a sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to  specify  the denominator of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use  1001
                                          for  the value of FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor. When you use  the  console  for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps.  Use  FramerateNumerator
                                          to  specify  the  numerator  of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When  you  use   the   console   for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                          If enable, use  reference  B  frames
                                          for   GOP  structures  that  have  B
                                          frames > 1.

                                      GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                                          Specify the  relative  frequency  of
                                          open  to closed GOPs in this output.
                                          For example, if you  want  to  allow
                                          four  open  GOPs  and then require a
                                          closed GOP, set this value to 5.  We
                                          recommend    that   you   have   the
                                          transcoder automatically choose this
                                          value  for you based on characteris-
                                          tics of your input video. To  enable
                                          this  automatic  behavior,  keep the
                                          default value by leaving  this  set-
                                          ting out of your JSON job specifica-
                                          tion. In the  console,  do  this  by
                                          keeping  the default empty value. If
                                          you do explicitly specify  a  value,
                                          for  segmented  outputs,  don't  set
                                          this value to 0.

                                      GopSize -> (double)
                                          Use this setting only when  you  set
                                          GOP  mode  control (GopSizeUnits) to
                                          Specified, frames (FRAMES) or Speci-
                                          fied, seconds (SECONDS). Specify the
                                          GOP length using a whole  number  of
                                          frames  or  a  decimal value of sec-
                                          onds.  MediaConvert  will  interpret
                                          this  value  as  frames  or  seconds
                                          depending on the  value  you  choose
                                          for GOP mode control (GopSizeUnits).
                                          If you want to allow MediaConvert to
                                          automatically  determine  GOP  size,
                                          leave GOP size  blank  and  set  GOP
                                          mode control to Auto (AUTO). If your
                                          output group specifies HLS, DASH, or
                                          CMAF,  leave  GOP size blank and set
                                          GOP mode control  to  Auto  in  each
                                          output in your output group.

                                      GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                                          Specify  how  the  transcoder deter-
                                          mines GOP size for this  output.  We
                                          recommend    that   you   have   the
                                          transcoder automatically choose this
                                          value  for you based on characteris-
                                          tics of your input video. To  enable
                                          this automatic behavior, choose Auto
                                          (AUTO) and and leave GOP size  (Gop-
                                          Size)  blank.  By  default,  if  you
                                          don't specify GOP mode control (Gop-
                                          SizeUnits),  MediaConvert  will  use
                                          automatic behavior. If  your  output
                                          group  specifies HLS, DASH, or CMAF,
                                          set GOP mode  control  to  Auto  and
                                          leave  GOP size blank in each output
                                          in your output group. To  explicitly
                                          specify the GOP length, choose Spec-
                                          ified, frames (FRAMES) or Specified,
                                          seconds  (SECONDS)  and then provide
                                          the GOP length in the  related  set-
                                          ting GOP size (GopSize).

                                      HrdBufferInitialFillPercentage -> (inte-
                                      ger)
                                          Percentage of the buffer that should
                                          initially   be  filled  (HRD  buffer
                                          model).

                                      HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                                          Size of buffer (HRD buffer model) in
                                          bits.   For   example,   enter  five
                                          megabits as 5000000.

                                      InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                          Choose the scan line  type  for  the
                                          output. Keep the default value, Pro-
                                          gressive (PROGRESSIVE) to  create  a
                                          progressive  output,  regardless  of
                                          the scan type of your input. Use Top
                                          field  first  (TOP_FIELD)  or Bottom
                                          field first (BOTTOM_FIELD) to create
                                          an output that's interlaced with the
                                          same field polarity throughout.  Use
                                          Follow,     default     top    (FOL-
                                          LOW_TOP_FIELD)  or  Follow,  default
                                          bottom (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to pro-
                                          duce outputs  with  the  same  field
                                          polarity  as  the  source.  For jobs
                                          that have multiple inputs, the  out-
                                          put field polarity might change over
                                          the course  of  the  output.  Follow
                                          behavior  depends  on the input scan
                                          type. If the source  is  interlaced,
                                          the  output  will be interlaced with
                                          the same polarity as the source.  If
                                          the  source is progressive, the out-
                                          put  will  be  interlaced  with  top
                                          field  bottom field first, depending
                                          on which of the Follow  options  you
                                          choose.

                                      MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                          Maximum  bitrate in bits/second. For
                                          example,  enter  five  megabits  per
                                          second  as  5000000.  Required  when
                                          Rate control mode is QVBR.

                                      MinIInterval -> (integer)
                                          Use this setting only when you  also
                                          enable    Scene   change   detection
                                          (SceneChangeDetect).  This   setting
                                          determines  how  the encoder manages
                                          the spacing between I-frames that it
                                          inserts   as  part  of  the  I-frame
                                          cadence and  the  I-frames  that  it
                                          inserts  for Scene change detection.
                                          We  recommend  that  you  have   the
                                          transcoder automatically choose this
                                          value for you based on  characteris-
                                          tics  of your input video. To enable
                                          this automatic  behavior,  keep  the
                                          default  value  by leaving this set-
                                          ting out of your JSON job specifica-
                                          tion.  In  the  console,  do this by
                                          keeping  the  default  empty  value.
                                          When  you explicitly specify a value
                                          for this setting, the encoder deter-
                                          mines     whether    to    skip    a
                                          cadence-driven I-frame by the  value
                                          you set. For example, if you set Min
                                          I interval (minIInterval) to 5 and a
                                          cadence-driven  I-frame  would  fall
                                          within 5 frames  of  a  scene-change
                                          I-frame,  then the encoder skips the
                                          cadence-driven I-frame. In this way,
                                          one  GOP  is shrunk slightly and one
                                          GOP is stretched slightly. When  the
                                          cadence-driven  I-frames are farther
                                          from the scene-change  I-frame  than
                                          the  value you set, then the encoder
                                          leaves all I-frames in place and the
                                          GOPs  surrounding  the  scene change
                                          are smaller than the  usual  cadence
                                          GOPs.

                                          are  whole numbers from 0 through 7.

                                          MediaConvert defaults to 2.

                                      NumberReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                                          Number  of  reference frames to use.
                                          The  encoder  may  use   more   than
                                          requested  if  using B-frames and/or

                                          determines  the  pixel  aspect ratio
                                          (PAR) for this output.  The  default
                                          behavior,  Follow  source  (INITIAL-
                                          IZE_FROM_SOURCE), uses the PAR  from
                                          your input video for your output. To
                                          specify a different PAR in the  con-

                                          specification,   choose   SPECIFIED.
                                          When  you  choose SPECIFIED for this
                                          setting, you must also specify  val-
                                          ues  for the parNumerator and parDe-
                                          nominator settings.

                                      ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                          Required when you set  Pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (parControl) to SPECIFIED. On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you specify an output  pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (PAR)  that is different from
                                          your input video PAR,  provide  your
                                          output  PAR as a ratio. For example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify  the  ratio  40:33.  In this
                                          example, the value for  parDenomina-
                                          tor is 33.

                                      ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                          Required  when  you set Pixel aspect
                                          ratio (parControl) to SPECIFIED.  On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you  specify  an output pixel aspect
                                          ratio (PAR) that is  different  from
                                          your  input  video PAR, provide your
                                          output PAR as a ratio. For  example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the  ratio  40:33.  In  this
                                          example,  the value for parNumerator
                                          is 40.

                                      QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                          Optional. Use Quality  tuning  level
                                          (qualityTuningLevel)  to  choose how
                                          you want to trade off encoding speed
                                          for   output   video   quality.  The
                                          default behavior  is  faster,  lower
                                          quality, single-pass encoding.

                                      QvbrSettings -> (structure)

                                          you set QVBR for Rate  control  mode
                                          (RateControlMode).

                                          MaxAverageBitrate -> (integer)
                                             Use  this  setting only when Rate
                                             control mode is QVBR and  Quality
                                             tuning  level  is  Multi-pass HQ.

                                             is  less  than  or  equal  to the
                                             value you set multiplied  by  the

                                          QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                                             Use this setting  only  when  you
                                             set  Rate  control mode (RateCon-
                                             trolMode) to  QVBR.  Specify  the

                                             output.  MediaConvert  determines
                                             the  right  number of bits to use
                                             for each part  of  the  video  to
                                             maintain  the  video quality that
                                             you specify. When  you  keep  the
                                             default value, AUTO, MediaConvert
                                             picks a quality  level  for  you,
                                             based  on characteristics of your
                                             input video.  If  you  prefer  to
                                             specify  a quality level, specify
                                             a number from 1 through  10.  Use
                                             higher  numbers for greater qual-
                                             ity. Level 10 results  in  nearly
                                             lossless compression. The quality
                                             level for most  broadcast-quality
                                             transcodes  is  between  6 and 9.

                                             qvbrQualityLevelFineTune.     For
                                             example, if you  want  your  QVBR
                                             quality  level  to  be  7.33, set
                                             qvbrQualityLevel  to  7  and  set
                                             qvbrQualityLevelFineTune  to .33.

                                             Optional. Specify a value here to
                                             set the QVBR quality to  a  level
                                             that  is  between  whole numbers.
                                             For example,  if  you  want  your
                                             QVBR  quality  level  to be 7.33,
                                             set qvbrQualityLevel to 7 and set
                                             qvbrQualityLevelFineTune  to .33.
                                             MediaConvert  rounds  your   QVBR
                                             quality   level  to  the  nearest

                                             qvbrQualityLevelFineTune  to .25,
                                             your actual QVBR quality level is
                                             7.33.

                                          frames per second (fps). Enable slow
                                          PAL to create a 25 fps output.  When
                                          you  enable  slow  PAL, MediaConvert
                                          relabels the video frames to 25  fps
                                          and  resamples your audio to keep it

                                          that   enabling  this  setting  will
                                          slightly reduce the duration of your

                                          (ENABLED),  to  adjust  quantization
                                          within each frame based  on  spatial
                                          variation   of  content  complexity.
                                          When you enable  this  feature,  the
                                          encoder  uses  fewer  bits  on areas
                                          that  can  sustain  more  distortion
                                          with  no  noticeable visual degrada-
                                          tion and uses  more  bits  on  areas
                                          where  any  small distortion will be
                                          noticeable.  For  example,   complex
                                          textured  blocks  are  encoded  with
                                          fewer  bits  and   smooth   textured
                                          blocks  are  encoded with more bits.
                                          Enabling this  feature  will  almost
                                          always  improve  your video quality.
                                          Note,  though,  that  this   feature
                                          doesn't  take into account where the
                                          viewer's attention is likely to  be.
                                          If viewers are likely to be focusing
                                          their attention on  a  part  of  the

                                          When you enable  this  feature,  the
                                          encoder  uses fewer bits on areas of

                                          uses  more  bits  on complex objects
                                          with sharp edges that  move  a  lot.
                                          For  example,  this feature improves
                                          the readability of text  tickers  on

                                          almost  always  improve  your  video
                                          quality.  Note,  though,  that  this

                                          likely  to be. If viewers are likely
                                          to be focusing their attention on  a

                                          put  compliant  with  the  following
                                          specification:   ISO   IECJTC1  SC29
                                          N13798 Text  ISO/IEC  FDIS  14496-15
                                          3rd  Edition. For these outputs, the
                                          service  stores  parameter  set  NAL
                                          units  in the sample headers but not
                                          in the  samples  directly.  For  MP4
                                          outputs,  when you choose HVC1, your
                                          output video might not work properly
                                          with  some  downstream  systems  and
                                          video players. The service  defaults
                                          to  marking your output as HEV1. For
                                          these outputs,  the  service  writes
                                          parameter  set  NAL  units  directly
                                          into the samples.

                                   Mpeg2Settings -> (structure)
                                      Required  when  you  set  (Codec)  under

                                      AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                                          Specify the strength of any adaptive
                                          quantization    filters   that   you
                                          enable. The value  that  you  choose
                                          here  applies  to the following set-
                                          tings: Spatial adaptive quantization
                                          (spatialAdaptiveQuantization),   and

                                      Bitrate -> (integer)
                                          Specify  the average bitrate in bits
                                          per second.  Required  for  VBR  and
                                          CBR. For MS Smooth outputs, bitrates
                                          must be unique when rounded down  to
                                          the nearest multiple of 1000.

                                      CodecLevel -> (string)
                                          Use  Level  (Mpeg2CodecLevel) to set
                                          the MPEG-2 level for the video  out-

                                      CodecProfile -> (string)
                                          Use  Profile  (Mpeg2CodecProfile) to
                                          set the MPEG-2 profile for the video
                                          output.

                                      DynamicSubGop -> (string)

                                          tive video quality  for  high-motion
                                          content. This will cause the service
                                          to use fewer B-frames  (which  infer
                                          information  based  on other frames)
                                          for  high-motion  portions  of   the
                                          video    and   more   B-frames   for
                                          low-motion  portions.  The   maximum
                                          number of B-frames is limited by the
                                          value you provide for the setting  B
                                          frames   between   reference  frames

                                      FramerateControl -> (string)
                                          If  you  are  using the console, use
                                          the Framerate setting to specify the
                                          frame  rate  for this output. If you
                                          want to keep the same frame rate  as
                                          the   input   video,  choose  Follow
                                          source. If you want to do frame rate
                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the dropdown list or choose  Custom.
                                          The framerates shown in the dropdown
                                          list are decimal  approximations  of
                                          fractions.  If  you  choose  Custom,
                                          specify your frame rate as  a  frac-
                                          tion.   If  you  are  creating  your
                                          transcoding job specification  as  a
                                          JSON  file  without the console, use
                                          FramerateControl  to  specify  which
                                          value the service uses for the frame
                                          rate for this  output.  Choose  INI-
                                          TIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE  if you want the
                                          service to use the frame  rate  from
                                          the  input.  Choose SPECIFIED if you
                                          want the service to  use  the  frame
                                          rate  you  specify  in  the settings
                                          FramerateNumerator and  FramerateDe-
                                          nominator.

                                      FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                          Choose  the  method  that  you  want
                                          MediaConvert  to use when increasing
                                          or decreasing  the  frame  rate.  We
                                          recommend   using   drop   duplicate
                                          (DUPLICATE_DROP)   for   numerically
                                          simple  conversions,  such as 60 fps
                                          to 30 fps. For  numerically  complex
                                          conversions, you can use interpolate
                                          (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This
                                          results  in  a  smooth  picture, but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts.  For  complex  frame rate
                                          conversions,  especially   if   your
                                          source  video  has already been con-
                                          verted from  its  original  cadence,
                                          use  FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion method  frame  by  frame.  Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to specify the denominator  of  this
                                          fraction.  In this example, use 1001
                                          for the value of  FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor.  When  you  use the console for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976  fps.  Use FramerateNumerator
                                          to specify  the  numerator  of  this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When   you   use   the  console  for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                                          Specify  the  relative  frequency of
                                          open to closed GOPs in this  output.
                                          For  example,  if  you want to allow
                                          four open GOPs and  then  require  a
                                          closed  GOP,  set  this  value to 5.
                                          When you create a streaming  output,
                                          we   recommend  that  you  keep  the
                                          default value, 1,  so  that  players
                                          starting  mid-stream  receive an IDR
                                          frame as quickly as possible.  Don't
                                          set  this  value  to  0;  that would
                                          break output segmenting.

                                      GopSize -> (double)
                                          Specify   the    interval    between
                                          keyframes, in seconds or frames, for

                                          for  GOP mode control (GopSizeUnits)
                                          is Frames (FRAMES).

                                      GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                                          Specify the units for GOP size (Gop-
                                          Size).  If you don't specify a value
                                          here, by default  the  encoder  mea-
                                          sures GOP size in frames.

                                      HrdBufferInitialFillPercentage -> (inte-
                                      ger)
                                          Percentage of the buffer that should
                                          initially   be  filled  (HRD  buffer
                                          model).

                                      HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                                          Size of buffer (HRD buffer model) in
                                          bits.   For   example,   enter  five
                                          megabits as 5000000.

                                      InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                          Choose the scan line  type  for  the
                                          output. Keep the default value, Pro-
                                          gressive (PROGRESSIVE) to  create  a
                                          progressive  output,  regardless  of
                                          the scan type of your input. Use Top
                                          field  first  (TOP_FIELD)  or Bottom
                                          field first (BOTTOM_FIELD) to create
                                          an output that's interlaced with the
                                          same field polarity throughout.  Use
                                          Follow,     default     top    (FOL-
                                          LOW_TOP_FIELD)  or  Follow,  default
                                          bottom (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to pro-
                                          duce outputs  with  the  same  field
                                          polarity  as  the  source.  For jobs
                                          that have multiple inputs, the  out-
                                          put field polarity might change over
                                          the course  of  the  output.  Follow
                                          behavior  depends  on the input scan
                                          type. If the source  is  interlaced,
                                          the  output  will be interlaced with
                                          the same polarity as the source.  If
                                          the  source is progressive, the out-
                                          put  will  be  interlaced  with  top
                                          field  bottom field first, depending
                                          on which of the Follow  options  you
                                          choose.

                                      IntraDcPrecision -> (string)
                                          Use Intra DC precision (Mpeg2IntraD-
                                          cPrecision) to set quantization pre-
                                          cision  for  intra-block  DC coeffi-
                                          cients.  If  you  choose  the  value
                                          auto, the service will automatically
                                          select the precision  based  on  the
                                          per-frame compression ratio.

                                      MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                          Maximum  bitrate in bits/second. For
                                          example,  enter  five  megabits  per
                                          second as 5000000.

                                      MinIInterval -> (integer)
                                          Use  this setting only when you also
                                          enable   Scene   change    detection
                                          (SceneChangeDetect).   This  setting
                                          determines how the  encoder  manages
                                          the spacing between I-frames that it
                                          inserts  as  part  of  the   I-frame
                                          cadence  and  the  I-frames  that it
                                          inserts for Scene change  detection.
                                          When  you  specify  a value for this
                                          setting,  the   encoder   determines
                                          whether  to  skip  a  cadence-driven
                                          I-frame by the value  you  set.  For
                                          example,  if  you set Min I interval
                                          (minIInterval)   to    5    and    a
                                          cadence-driven  I-frame  would  fall
                                          within 5 frames  of  a  scene-change
                                          I-frame,  then the encoder skips the
                                          cadence-driven I-frame. In this way,
                                          one  GOP  is shrunk slightly and one
                                          GOP is stretched slightly. When  the
                                          cadence-driven  I-frames are farther
                                          from the scene-change  I-frame  than
                                          the  value you set, then the encoder
                                          leaves all I-frames in place and the
                                          GOPs  surrounding  the  scene change
                                          are smaller than the  usual  cadence
                                          GOPs.

                                      NumberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames   ->
                                      (integer)
                                          Specify the number of B-frames  that
                                          MediaConvert  puts between reference
                                          frames in this output. Valid  values
                                          are  whole numbers from 0 through 7.
                                          When  you  don't  specify  a  value,
                                          MediaConvert defaults to 2.

                                      ParControl -> (string)
                                          Optional.  Specify  how  the service
                                          determines the  pixel  aspect  ratio
                                          (PAR)  for  this output. The default
                                          behavior,  Follow  source  (INITIAL-
                                          IZE_FROM_SOURCE),  uses the PAR from
                                          your input video for your output. To
                                          specify  a different PAR in the con-
                                          sole, choose any  value  other  than
                                          Follow  source. To specify a differ-
                                          ent PAR  by  editing  the  JSON  job
                                          specification,   choose   SPECIFIED.
                                          When you choose SPECIFIED  for  this
                                          setting,  you must also specify val-
                                          ues for the parNumerator and  parDe-
                                          nominator settings.

                                      ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                          Required  when  you set Pixel aspect
                                          ratio (parControl) to SPECIFIED.  On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you  specify  an output pixel aspect
                                          ratio (PAR) that is  different  from
                                          your  input  video PAR, provide your
                                          output PAR as a ratio. For  example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the  ratio  40:33.  In  this
                                          example,  the value for parDenomina-
                                          tor is 33.

                                      ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                          Required when you set  Pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (parControl) to SPECIFIED. On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you specify an output  pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (PAR)  that is different from
                                          your input video PAR,  provide  your
                                          output  PAR as a ratio. For example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify  the  ratio  40:33.  In this
                                          example, the value for  parNumerator
                                          is 40.

                                      QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                          Optional.  Use  Quality tuning level
                                          (qualityTuningLevel) to  choose  how
                                          you want to trade off encoding speed
                                          for  output   video   quality.   The
                                          default  behavior  is  faster, lower
                                          quality, single-pass encoding.

                                      RateControlMode -> (string)
                                          Use Rate control mode (Mpeg2RateCon-
                                          trolMode)  to  specify  whether  the
                                          bitrate is variable  (vbr)  or  con-
                                          stant (cbr).

                                      ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                                          Use this setting for interlaced out-
                                          puts, when your output frame rate is
                                          half  of  your  input frame rate. In
                                          this  situation,  choose   Optimized
                                          interlacing (INTERLACED_OPTIMIZE) to
                                          create a better  quality  interlaced
                                          output.  In this case, each progres-

                                          ment,  we  recommend that you adjust
                                          the softness of your output by using
                                          a lower value for the setting Sharp-
                                          ness (sharpness) or  by  enabling  a
                                          noise  reducer filter (noiseReducer-
                                          Filter).  The  Softness   (softness)
                                          setting  specifies  the quantization
                                          matrices that the encoder uses. Keep
                                          the default value, 0, to use the AWS
                                          Elemental default matrices. Choose a
                                          value  from  17 to 128 to use planar
                                          interpolation.   Increasing   values
                                          from  17 to 128 result in increasing
                                          reduction  of  high-frequency  data.
                                          The value 128 results in the softest
                                          video.

                                          When you enable  this  feature,  the

                                          with  no  noticeable visual degrada-
                                          tion and uses  more  bits  on  areas
                                          where  any  small distortion will be
                                          noticeable.  For  example,   complex
                                          textured  blocks  are  encoded  with
                                          fewer  bits  and   smooth   textured
                                          blocks  are  encoded with more bits.
                                          Enabling this  feature  will  almost
                                          always  improve  your video quality.
                                          Note,  though,  that  this   feature
                                          doesn't  take into account where the

                                          recommend   using   drop   duplicate
                                          (DUPLICATE_DROP)   for   numerically
                                          simple conversions, such as  60  fps
                                          to  30  fps. For numerically complex
                                          conversions, you can use interpolate
                                          (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This
                                          results in  a  smooth  picture,  but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts. For  complex  frame  rate
                                          conversions,   especially   if  your
                                          source video has already  been  con-
                                          verted  from  its  original cadence,
                                          use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to  do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion  method  frame  by  frame. Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding  time  and incurs a sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to  specify  the denominator of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use  1001
                                          for  the value of FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor. When you use  the  console  for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps.  Use  FramerateNumerator
                                          to  specify  the  numerator  of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When  you  use   the   console   for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                          the scan type of your input. Use Top

                                          field first (BOTTOM_FIELD) to create
                                          an output that's interlaced with the
                                          same field polarity throughout.  Use

                                          duce outputs  with  the  same  field
                                          polarity  as  the  source.  For jobs
                                          that have multiple inputs, the  out-
                                          put field polarity might change over
                                          the course  of  the  output.  Follow
                                          behavior  depends  on the input scan
                                          type. If the source  is  interlaced,
                                          the  output  will be interlaced with
                                          the same polarity as the source.  If
                                          the  source is progressive, the out-
                                          put  will  be  interlaced  with  top

                                          your  input  video PAR, provide your
                                          output PAR as a ratio. For  example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the  ratio  40:33.  In  this
                                          example,  the value for parDenomina-

                                          Choose  the  method  that  you  want
                                          MediaConvert  to use when increasing
                                          or decreasing  the  frame  rate.  We
                                          recommend   using   drop   duplicate
                                          (DUPLICATE_DROP)   for   numerically
                                          simple  conversions,  such as 60 fps
                                          to 30 fps. For  numerically  complex
                                          conversions, you can use interpolate
                                          (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This
                                          results  in  a  smooth  picture, but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts.  For  complex  frame rate
                                          conversions,  especially   if   your
                                          source  video  has already been con-
                                          verted from  its  original  cadence,
                                          use  FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion method  frame  by  frame.  Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to specify the denominator  of  this
                                          fraction.  In this example, use 1001
                                          for the value of  FramerateDenomina-

                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976  fps.  Use FramerateNumerator
                                          to specify  the  numerator  of  this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When   you   use   the  console  for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                          determine your output  bitrate.  For
                                          example, say that your video resolu-
                                          tion is 1920x1080 and your framerate
                                          is 29.97. Then Class 145 (CLASS_145)
                                          gives you an output with  a  bitrate

                                      FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                          Choose  the  method  that  you  want
                                          MediaConvert  to use when increasing
                                          or decreasing  the  frame  rate.  We
                                          recommend   using   drop   duplicate
                                          (DUPLICATE_DROP)   for   numerically
                                          simple  conversions,  such as 60 fps
                                          to 30 fps. For  numerically  complex
                                          conversions, you can use interpolate
                                          (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This
                                          results  in  a  smooth  picture, but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts.  For  complex  frame rate
                                          conversions,  especially   if   your
                                          source  video  has already been con-
                                          verted from  its  original  cadence,
                                          use  FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion method  frame  by  frame.  Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to specify the denominator  of  this
                                          fraction.  In this example, use 1001
                                          for the value of  FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor.  When  you  use the console for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976  fps.  Use FramerateNumerator
                                          to specify  the  numerator  of  this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When   you   use   the  console  for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      GopSize -> (double)
                                          GOP  Length  (keyframe  interval) in
                                          frames. Must be greater than zero.

                                      HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                                          Optional. Size of buffer (HRD buffer
                                          model)  in  bits. For example, enter
                                          five megabits as 5000000.

                                      MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                          Ignore this setting unless  you  set
                                          qualityTuningLevel   to  MULTI_PASS.
                                          Optional.   Specify   the    maximum
                                          bitrate in bits/second. For example,
                                          enter five megabits  per  second  as
                                          5000000.  The  default behavior uses
                                          twice the target bitrate as the max-
                                          imum bitrate.

                                      ParControl -> (string)
                                          Optional.  Specify  how  the service
                                          determines the  pixel  aspect  ratio
                                          (PAR)  for  this output. The default
                                          behavior,  Follow  source  (INITIAL-
                                          IZE_FROM_SOURCE),  uses the PAR from
                                          your input video for your output. To
                                          specify  a different PAR in the con-
                                          sole, choose any  value  other  than
                                          Follow  source. To specify a differ-
                                          ent PAR  by  editing  the  JSON  job
                                          specification,   choose   SPECIFIED.
                                          When you choose SPECIFIED  for  this
                                          setting,  you must also specify val-
                                          ues for the parNumerator and  parDe-
                                          nominator settings.

                                      ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                          Required  when  you set Pixel aspect
                                          ratio (parControl) to SPECIFIED.  On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you  specify  an output pixel aspect
                                          ratio (PAR) that is  different  from
                                          your  input  video PAR, provide your
                                          output PAR as a ratio. For  example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the  ratio  40:33.  In  this
                                          example,  the value for parDenomina-
                                          tor is 33.

                                      ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                          Required when you set  Pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (parControl) to SPECIFIED. On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you specify an output  pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (PAR)  that is different from
                                          your input video PAR,  provide  your
                                          output  PAR as a ratio. For example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify  the  ratio  40:33.  In this
                                          example, the value for  parNumerator
                                          is 40.

                                      QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                          Optional.  Use  Quality tuning level
                                          (qualityTuningLevel) to  choose  how
                                          you want to trade off encoding speed
                                          for  output   video   quality.   The
                                          default  behavior  is  faster, lower
                                          quality, multi-pass encoding.

                                      RateControlMode -> (string)
                                          With the VP8 codec, you can use only
                                          the variable bitrate (VBR) rate con-
                                          trol mode.

                                   Vp9Settings -> (structure)
                                      Required  when  you  set  (Codec)  under
                                      (VideoDescription)>(CodecSettings)    to
                                      the value VP9.

                                      Bitrate -> (integer)
                                          Target bitrate in  bits/second.  For
                                          example,  enter  five  megabits  per
                                          second as 5000000.

                                      FramerateControl -> (string)
                                          If you are using  the  console,  use
                                          the Framerate setting to specify the
                                          frame rate for this output.  If  you
                                          want  to keep the same frame rate as
                                          the  input  video,   choose   Follow
                                          source. If you want to do frame rate
                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the  dropdown list or choose Custom.
                                          The framerates shown in the dropdown
                                          list  are  decimal approximations of
                                          fractions.  If  you  choose  Custom,
                                          specify  your  frame rate as a frac-
                                          tion.  If  you  are  creating   your
                                          transcoding  job  specification as a
                                          JSON file without the  console,  use
                                          FramerateControl  to  specify  which
                                          value the service uses for the frame
                                          rate  for  this  output. Choose INI-
                                          TIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE if you want  the
                                          service  to  use the frame rate from
                                          the input. Choose SPECIFIED  if  you
                                          want  the  service  to use the frame
                                          rate you  specify  in  the  settings
                                          FramerateNumerator  and FramerateDe-
                                          nominator.

                                      FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                          Choose  the  method  that  you  want
                                          MediaConvert to use when  increasing
                                          or  decreasing  the  frame  rate. We
                                          recommend   using   drop   duplicate
                                          (DUPLICATE_DROP)   for   numerically
                                          simple conversions, such as  60  fps
                                          to  30  fps. For numerically complex
                                          conversions, you can use interpolate
                                          (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This
                                          results in  a  smooth  picture,  but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts. For  complex  frame  rate
                                          conversions,   especially   if  your
                                          source video has already  been  con-
                                          verted  from  its  original cadence,
                                          use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to  do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion  method  frame  by  frame. Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding  time  and incurs a sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to  specify  the denominator of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use  1001
                                          for  the value of FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor. When you use  the  console  for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps.  Use  FramerateNumerator
                                          to  specify  the  numerator  of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When  you  use   the   console   for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      GopSize -> (double)
                                          GOP Length  (keyframe  interval)  in
                                          frames. Must be greater than zero.

                                      HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                                          Size of buffer (HRD buffer model) in
                                          bits.  For   example,   enter   five
                                          megabits as 5000000.

                                      MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                          Ignore  this  setting unless you set
                                          qualityTuningLevel  to   MULTI_PASS.
                                          Optional.    Specify   the   maximum
                                          bitrate in bits/second. For example,
                                          enter  five  megabits  per second as
                                          5000000. The default  behavior  uses
                                          twice the target bitrate as the max-
                                          imum bitrate.

                                      ParControl -> (string)
                                          Optional. Specify  how  the  service
                                          determines  the  pixel  aspect ratio
                                          for this output. The default  behav-
                                          ior  is to use the same pixel aspect
                                          ratio as your input video.

                                      ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                          Required when you set  Pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (parControl) to SPECIFIED. On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you specify an output  pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (PAR)  that is different from
                                          your input video PAR,  provide  your
                                          output  PAR as a ratio. For example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify  the  ratio  40:33.  In this
                                          example, the value for  parDenomina-
                                          tor is 33.

                                      ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                          Required  when  you set Pixel aspect
                                          ratio (parControl) to SPECIFIED.  On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you  specify  an output pixel aspect
                                          ratio (PAR) that is  different  from
                                          your  input  video PAR, provide your
                                          output PAR as a ratio. For  example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the  ratio  40:33.  In  this
                                          example,  the value for parNumerator
                                          is 40.

                                      QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                          Optional. Use Quality  tuning  level
                                          (qualityTuningLevel)  to  choose how
                                          you want to trade off encoding speed
                                          for   output   video   quality.  The
                                          default behavior  is  faster,  lower
                                          quality, multi-pass encoding.

                                      RateControlMode -> (string)
                                          With the VP9 codec, you can use only
                                          the variable bitrate (VBR) rate con-
                                          trol mode.

                                   XavcSettings -> (structure)
                                      Required  when  you  set  (Codec)  under
                                      (VideoDescription)>(CodecSettings)    to
                                      the value XAVC.

                                      AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                                          Keep the default value, Auto (AUTO),
                                          for this setting to  have  MediaCon-
                                          vert  automatically  apply  the best
                                          types of quantization for your video
                                          content. When you want to apply your
                                          quantization settings manually,  you
                                          must   set   Adaptive   quantization
                                          (adaptiveQuantization)  to  a  value
                                          other  than  Auto  (AUTO).  Use this
                                          setting to specify the  strength  of
                                          any  adaptive  quantization  filters
                                          that you enable. If you  don't  want
                                          MediaConvert   to  do  any  adaptive
                                          quantization in this transcode,  set
                                          Adaptive  quantization to Off (OFF).

                                          Optional.  Choose a specific entropy
                                          encoding mode only when you want  to
                                          override  XAVC  recommendations.  If
                                          you choose the value auto, MediaCon-
                                          vert  uses  the  mode  that the XAVC

                                      FramerateControl -> (string)
                                          If  you  are  using the console, use
                                          the Frame rate  setting  to  specify
                                          the  frame  rate for this output. If
                                          you want to keep the same frame rate
                                          as  the  input  video, choose Follow
                                          source. If you want to do frame rate
                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the dropdown  list.  The  framerates
                                          shown in the dropdown list are deci-

                                          to 30 fps. For  numerically  complex
                                          conversions, you can use interpolate
                                          (INTERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This
                                          results  in  a  smooth  picture, but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts.  For  complex  frame rate
                                          conversions,  especially   if   your
                                          source  video  has already been con-
                                          verted from  its  original  cadence,
                                          use  FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion method  frame  by  frame.  Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to specify the denominator  of  this
                                          fraction.  In this example, use 1001
                                          for the value of  FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor.  When  you  use the console for

                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal number for  Frame  rate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)

                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976  fps.  Use FramerateNumerator
                                          to specify  the  numerator  of  this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When   you   use   the  console  for

                                          the softness of your output by using
                                          a lower value for the setting Sharp-

                                          polation.  Increasing values from 17
                                          to 128 result in  increasing  reduc-
                                          tion  of  high-frequency  data.  The
                                          value 128  results  in  the  softest

                                          this feature, the encoder uses fewer
                                          bits on areas that can sustain  more
                                          distortion with no noticeable visual
                                          degradation and uses  more  bits  on
                                          areas  where  any  small  distortion
                                          will  be  noticeable.  For  example,
                                          complex  textured blocks are encoded
                                          with fewer bits and smooth  textured
                                          blocks  are  encoded with more bits.
                                          Enabling this  feature  will  almost
                                          always  improve  your video quality.

                                          this feature, the encoder uses fewer
                                          bits  on  areas  of  the  frame that
                                          aren't moving and uses more bits  on
                                          complex  objects  with  sharp  edges
                                          that move a lot. For  example,  this
                                          feature  improves the readability of
                                          text tickers on newscasts and score-
                                          boards  on  sports matches. Enabling
                                          this  feature  will  almost   always
                                          improve  your  video  quality. Note,

                                             The  best  way to set up adaptive

                                             when  you  choose  to  change the

                                             have the encoder  reduce  I-frame
                                             pop.  I-frame  pop  appears  as a

                                             when  the  encoder  saves bits by
                                             copying  some  macroblocks   many
                                             times  from  frame  to frame, and
                                             then  refreshes   them   at   the
                                             I-frame.  When  you  enable  this
                                             setting,  the   encoder   updates
                                             these  macroblocks  slightly more
                                             often to smooth out the  flicker.

                                             jobs  that  have multiple inputs,
                                             the output field  polarity  might

                                             on  the  input  scan type. If the
                                             source is interlaced, the  output
                                             will  be interlaced with the same
                                             polarity as the  source.  If  the
                                             source is progressive, the output
                                             will be interlaced with top field
                                             bottom  field first, depending on
                                             which of the Follow  options  you
                                             choose.

                                   metadata  from  this  output.  If you don't
                                   specify a value, the service sets  this  to
                                   Insert by default.

                               Crop -> (structure)
                                   Use  Cropping  selection  (crop) to specify
                                   the  video  area  that  the  service   will
                                   include in the output video frame.

                                   Height -> (integer)
                                      Height  of  rectangle in pixels. Specify
                                      only even numbers.

                                   Width -> (integer)
                                      Width of rectangle  in  pixels.  Specify
                                      only even numbers.

                                   X -> (integer)
                                      The  distance,  in  pixels,  between the
                                      rectangle and the left edge of the video
                                      frame. Specify only even numbers.

                                   Y -> (integer)
                                      The  distance,  in  pixels,  between the
                                      rectangle and the top edge of the  video
                                      frame. Specify only even numbers.

                               DropFrameTimecode -> (string)
                                   Applies  only  to  29.97  fps outputs. When
                                   this feature is enabled, the  service  will
                                   use  drop-frame  timecode on outputs. If it
                                   is not possible to use drop-frame timecode,
                                   the    system    will    fall    back    to
                                   non-drop-frame. This setting is enabled  by
                                   default   when  Timecode  insertion  (Time-
                                   codeInsertion) is enabled.

                               FixedAfd -> (integer)
                                   Applies  only  if  you  set   AFD   Signal-
                                   ing(AfdSignaling)  to  Fixed  (FIXED).  Use
                                   Fixed (FixedAfd) to specify a four-bit  AFD
                                   value  which  the service will write on all
                                   frames of this video output.

                               Height -> (integer)
                                   Use the Height (Height) setting  to  define
                                   the  video  resolution height for this out-
                                   put. Specify in pixels. If you  don't  pro-
                                   vide a value here, the service will use the
                                   input height.

                               Position -> (structure)
                                   Use  Selection  placement   (position)   to
                                   define the video area in your output frame.
                                   The area outside of the rectangle that  you
                                   specify here is black.

                                   Height -> (integer)
                                      Height  of  rectangle in pixels. Specify
                                      only even numbers.

                                   Width -> (integer)
                                      Width of rectangle  in  pixels.  Specify
                                      only even numbers.

                                   X -> (integer)
                                      The  distance,  in  pixels,  between the
                                      rectangle and the left edge of the video
                                      frame. Specify only even numbers.

                                   Y -> (integer)

                                      rectangle and the top edge of the  video
                                      frame. Specify only even numbers.

                               RespondToAfd -> (string)
                                   Use  Respond to AFD (RespondToAfd) to spec-
                                   ify  how  the  service  changes  the  video
                                   itself  in  response  to  AFD values in the
                                   input. * Choose Respond to clip  the  input
                                   video  frame  according  to  the AFD value,
                                   input display aspect ratio, and output dis-
                                   play  aspect ratio. * Choose Passthrough to
                                   include the input AFD values. Do not choose
                                   this  when AfdSignaling is set to (NONE). A
                                   preferred implementation of  this  workflow
                                   is  to  set  RespondToAfd to (NONE) and set
                                   AfdSignaling to (AUTO). *  Choose  None  to
                                   remove  all input AFD values from this out-
                                   put.

                               ScalingBehavior -> (string)
                                   Specify how  the  service  handles  outputs
                                   that have a different aspect ratio from the
                                   input aspect ratio. Choose Stretch to  out-
                                   put (STRETCH_TO_OUTPUT) to have the service
                                   stretch your video image to fit.  Keep  the
                                   setting  Default (DEFAULT) to have the ser-
                                   vice letterbox  your  video  instead.  This
                                   setting  overrides any value that you spec-
                                   ify for  the  setting  Selection  placement
                                   (position) in this output.

                               Sharpness -> (integer)
                                   Use  Sharpness (Sharpness) setting to spec-
                                   ify the  strength  of  anti-aliasing.  This
                                   setting changes the width of the anti-alias
                                   filter kernel used for  scaling.  Sharpness
                                   only  applies  if your output resolution is
                                   different from your input resolution. 0  is
                                   the  softest setting, 100 the sharpest, and
                                   50 recommended for most content.

                               TimecodeInsertion -> (string)
                                   Applies only to H.264,  H.265,  MPEG2,  and
                                   ProRes outputs. Only enable Timecode inser-
                                   tion when the input frame rate is identical
                                   to  the output frame rate. To include time-
                                   codes in this output, set  Timecode  inser-
                                   tion  (VideoTimecodeInsertion)  to PIC_TIM-
                                   ING_SEI. To leave them out, set it to  DIS-
                                   ABLED.  Default  is DISABLED. When the ser-
                                   vice inserts timecodes  in  an  output,  by
                                   default,  it  uses  any  embedded timecodes
                                   from the input. If none  are  present,  the
                                   service will set the timecode for the first
                                   output  frame  to  zero.  To  change   this
                                   default behavior, adjust the settings under
                                   Timecode configuration (TimecodeConfig). In
                                   the  console,  these  settings  are located
                                   under Job > Job settings > Timecode config-

                                      Brightness -> (integer)
                                          Brightness level.

                                      ColorSpaceConversion -> (string)
                                          Specify the color space you want for
                                          this  output.  The  service supports
                                          conversion  between   HDR   formats,
                                          between  SDR  formats,  from  SDR to
                                          HDR, and from HDR to SDR. SDR to HDR
                                          conversion   doesn't   upgrade   the
                                          dynamic range. The  converted  video
                                          has  an  HDR  format,  but  visually
                                          appears the same as  an  unconverted
                                          output.  HDR  to SDR conversion uses
                                          Elemental tone mapping technology to
                                          approximate  the outcome of manually

                                             each asset. Do this by setting up
                                             two output groups. For one output
                                             group,  set  the value of Payload
                                             ID (payload) to 0 in  every  out-
                                             put.  For the other output group,
                                             set Payload ID (payload) to 1  in
                                             every output.

                                          Strength -> (string)
                                             Optional.   Ignore  this  setting
                                             unless Nagra support directs  you
                                             to  specify  a  value.  When  you
                                             don't specify a value  here,  the
                                             Nagra  NexGuard  library uses its
                                             default value.

                                   TimecodeBurnin -> (structure)
                                      Settings for burning the output timecode
                                      and specified prefix into the output.

                                      FontSize -> (integer)
                                          Use  Font Size (FontSize) to set the
                                          font size of any burned-in timecode.
                                          Valid values are 10, 16, 32, 48.

                                      Position -> (string)
                                          Use  Position (Position) under under
                                          Timecode burn-in (TimecodeBurnIn) to
                                          specify  the  location the burned-in
                                          timecode on output video.

                                      Prefix -> (string)
                                          Use Prefix (Prefix) to  place  ASCII
                                          characters   before   any  burned-in
                                          timecode. For example, a  prefix  of
                                          "EZ-"  will  result  in the timecode
                                          "EZ-00:00:00:00". Provide either the
                                          characters  themselves  or the ASCII
                                          code  equivalents.   The   supported
                                          range  of characters is 0x20 through
                                          0x7e. This  includes  letters,  num-
                                          bers,  and  all  special  characters
                                          represented on  a  standard  English
                                          keyboard.

                               Width -> (integer)
                                   Use Width (Width) to define the video reso-
                                   lution width, in pixels, for  this  output.
                                   If you don't provide a value here, the ser-
                                   vice will use the input width.

              TimecodeConfig -> (structure)
                 These settings control  how  the  service  handles  timecodes
                 throughout  the  job. These settings don't affect input clip-
                 ping.

                 Anchor -> (string)
                     If you use an editing platform that relies on  an  anchor
                     timecode, use Anchor Timecode (Anchor) to specify a time-
                     code that will match the input video frame to the  output
                     video  frame.  Use  24-hour  format  with  frame  number,
                     (HH:MM:SS:FF)  or  (HH:MM:SS;FF).  This  setting  ignores
                     frame  rate  conversion. System behavior for Anchor Time-
                     code varies depending on your setting for  Source  (Time-
                     codeSource). * If Source (TimecodeSource) is set to Spec-
                     ified Start (SPECIFIEDSTART), the first  input  frame  is
                     the  specified  value  in  Start Timecode (Start). Anchor
                     Timecode (Anchor) and Start  Timecode  (Start)  are  used
                     calculate  output  timecode. * If Source (TimecodeSource)
                     is set to Start at  0  (ZEROBASED)  the  first  frame  is
                     00:00:00:00.  *  If  Source  (TimecodeSource)  is  set to
                     Embedded (EMBEDDED), the  first  frame  is  the  timecode
                     value on the first input frame of the input.

                 Source -> (string)
                     Use Source (TimecodeSource) to set how timecodes are han-
                     dled within this job.  To  make  sure  that  your  video,
                     audio,  captions,  and  markers are synchronized and that
                     time-based features, such as image  inserter,  work  cor-
                     rectly,  choose  the  Timecode source option that matches
                     your assets. All timecodes are in a 24-hour  format  with
                     frame  number  (HH:MM:SS:FF). * Embedded (EMBEDDED) - Use
                     the timecode that is in the input video. If  no  embedded
                     timecode  is in the source, the service will use Start at
                     0 (ZEROBASED) instead. * Start at 0 (ZEROBASED) - Set the
                     timecode of the initial frame to 00:00:00:00. * Specified
                     Start (SPECIFIEDSTART) - Set the timecode of the  initial
                     frame  to a value other than zero. You use Start timecode
                     (Start) to provide this value.

                 Start -> (string)
                     Only use when you set Source (TimecodeSource)  to  Speci-
                     fied  start  (SPECIFIEDSTART). Use Start timecode (Start)
                     to specify  the  timecode  for  the  initial  frame.  Use
                     24-hour   format  with  frame  number,  (HH:MM:SS:FF)  or
                     (HH:MM:SS;FF).

                 TimestampOffset -> (string)
                     Only applies to outputs  that  support  program-date-time
                     stamp.  Use  Timestamp  offset (TimestampOffset) to over-
                     write the timecode date without affecting  the  time  and
                     frame  number.  Provide  the  new date as a string in the
                     format "yyyy-mm-dd". To use Time stamp offset,  you  must
                     also  enable Insert program-date-time (InsertProgramDate-
                     Time) in the output settings. For example,  if  the  date
                     part  of  your  timecodes  is  2002-1-25  and you want to
                     change it to one year later, set Timestamp offset (Times-
                     tampOffset) to 2003-1-25.

              TimedMetadataInsertion -> (structure)
                 Enable  Timed  metadata insertion (TimedMetadataInsertion) to
                 include ID3 tags in any HLS outputs. To include  timed  meta-
                 data,  you must enable it here, enable it in each output con-
                 tainer, and specify  tags  and  timecodes  in  ID3  insertion
                 (Id3Insertion) objects.

                 Id3Insertions -> (list)
                     Id3Insertions   contains   the   array   of  Id3Insertion
                     instances.

                     (structure)
                        To insert ID3 tags in your output, specify two values.
                        Use  ID3  tag  (Id3)  to  specify  the base 64 encoded
                        string and use Timecode (TimeCode) to specify the time
                        when  the  tag  should be inserted. To insert multiple
                        ID3 tags in your output, create multiple instances  of
                        ID3 insertion (Id3Insertion).

                        Id3 -> (string)
                            Use  ID3  tag  (Id3)  to  provide  a  tag value in
                            base64-encode format.

                        Timecode -> (string)
                            Provide a Timecode (TimeCode)  in  HH:MM:SS:FF  or
                            HH:MM:SS;FF format.

          SimulateReservedQueue -> (string)
              Enable this setting when you run a test job to estimate how many
              reserved transcoding slots (RTS) you need. When this is enabled,
              MediaConvert  runs your job from an on-demand queue with similar
              performance to what you will see with  one  RTS  in  a  reserved
              queue. This setting is disabled by default.

          Status -> (string)
              A  job's  status  can  be SUBMITTED, PROGRESSING, COMPLETE, CAN-
              CELED, or ERROR.

          StatusUpdateInterval -> (string)
              Specify how often MediaConvert  sends  STATUS_UPDATE  events  to
              Amazon  CloudWatch Events. Set the interval, in seconds, between
              status updates. MediaConvert sends an update  at  this  interval
              from the time the service begins processing your job to the time
              it completes the transcode or encounters an error.

          Timing -> (structure)
              Information about when jobs are submitted, started, and finished
              is specified in Unix epoch format in seconds.

              FinishTime -> (timestamp)
