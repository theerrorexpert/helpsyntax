GET-QUEUE()                                                        GET-QUEUE()



NAME
       get-queue -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieve the JSON for a specific queue.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-queue
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name  (string) The name of the queue that you want information about.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

OUTPUT
       Queue -> (structure)
          You can use queues to manage the resources  that  are  available  to
          your  AWS  account for running multiple transcoding jobs at the same
          time. If you don't specify a  queue,  the  service  sends  all  jobs
          through    the    default   queue.   For   more   information,   see
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/working-with-queues.html.

          Arn -> (string)
              An  identifier  for  this  resource that is unique within all of
              AWS.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp in epoch seconds for when you created the queue.

          Description -> (string)
              An optional description that you create for each queue.

          LastUpdated -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp in  epoch  seconds  for  when  you  most  recently
              updated the queue.

          Name -> (string)
              A  name that you create for each queue. Each name must be unique
              within your account.

          PricingPlan -> (string)
              Specifies whether the pricing plan for the queue is on-demand or
              reserved.  For  on-demand,  you pay per minute, billed in incre-
              ments of .01 minute. For reserved, you pay for  the  transcoding
              capacity of the entire queue, regardless of how much or how lit-
              tle you use it. Reserved pricing requires a 12-month commitment.

          ProgressingJobsCount -> (integer)
              The estimated number of jobs with a PROGRESSING status.

          ReservationPlan -> (structure)
              Details about the pricing plan for your reserved queue. Required
              for reserved queues and not applicable to on-demand queues.

              Commitment -> (string)
                 The length of the term of your reserved  queue  pricing  plan
                 commitment.

              ExpiresAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  timestamp  in epoch seconds for when the current pricing
                 plan term for this reserved queue expires.

              PurchasedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp in epoch seconds for when you set up  the  cur-
                 rent pricing plan for this reserved queue.

              RenewalType -> (string)
                 Specifies  whether  the  term  of your reserved queue pricing
                 plan  is  automatically  extended  (AUTO_RENEW)  or   expires
                 (EXPIRE) at the end of the term.

              ReservedSlots -> (integer)
                 Specifies  the  number  of reserved transcode slots (RTS) for
                 this queue. The number of RTS determines how  many  jobs  the
                 queue  can  process in parallel; each RTS can process one job
                 at a time. When you increase this  number,  you  extend  your
                 existing  commitment  with  a  new  12-month commitment for a
                 larger number of RTS. The new commitment begins when you pur-
                 chase  the additional capacity. You can't decrease the number
                 of RTS in your reserved queue.

              Status -> (string)
                 Specifies whether the pricing plan for your reserved queue is
                 ACTIVE or EXPIRED.

          Status -> (string)
              Queues  can  be ACTIVE or PAUSED. If you pause a queue, the ser-
              vice won't begin processing jobs in that queue.  Jobs  that  are
              running when you pause the queue continue to run until they fin-
              ish or result in an error.

          SubmittedJobsCount -> (integer)
              The estimated number of jobs with a SUBMITTED status.

          Type -> (string)
              Specifies whether this on-demand queue is system or custom. Sys-
              tem  queues  are  built  in.  You  can't modify or delete system
              queues. You can create and modify custom queues.
