RESTORE-SERVER()                                              RESTORE-SERVER()



NAME
       restore-server -

DESCRIPTION
       Restores  a backup to a server that is in a CONNECTION_LOST , HEALTHY ,
       RUNNING , UNHEALTHY , or TERMINATED state. When you run  RestoreServer,
       the server's EC2 instance is deleted, and a new EC2 instance is config-
       ured. RestoreServer maintains the existing server endpoint, so configu-
       ration  management  of  the server's client devices (nodes) should con-
       tinue to work.

       Restoring from a backup is performed by creating a new EC2 instance. If
       restoration  is  successful,  and the server is in a HEALTHY state, AWS
       OpsWorks CM switches traffic over to the new instance.  After  restora-
       tion  is  finished,  the old EC2 instance is maintained in a Running or
       Stopped state, but is eventually terminated.

       This operation is asynchronous.

       An InvalidStateException is thrown when the server is not  in  a  valid
       state.  A  ResourceNotFoundException is thrown when the server does not
       exist. A ValidationException is raised when parameters of  the  request
       are not valid.

SYNOPSIS
            restore-server
          --backup-id <value>
          --server-name <value>
          [--instance-type <value>]
          [--key-pair <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --backup-id (string)
          The ID of the backup that you want to use to restore a server.

       --server-name (string)
          The name of the server that you want to restore.

       --instance-type (string)
          The  type  of instance to restore. Valid values must be specified in
          the following format: ^([cm][34]|t2).* For example, m5.large . Valid
          values  are  m5.large  ,  r5.xlarge , and r5.2xlarge . If you do not
          specify this parameter, RestoreServer uses the  instance  type  from
          the specified backup.

       --key-pair (string)
          The name of the key pair to set on the new EC2 instance. This can be
          helpful if the administrator no longer has the SSH key.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To restore a server

       The following restore-server command performs an  in-place  restoration
       of a Chef Automate server named automate-06 in your default region from
       a backup with an ID of automate-06-2016-11-22T16:13:27.998Z.  Restoring
       a  server  restores  connections  to  the  nodes that the Chef Automate
       server was managing at the time that  the  specified  backup  was  per-
       formed.
          aws      opsworks-cm      restore-server      --backup-id     "auto-
          mate-06-2016-11-22T16:13:27.998Z" --server-name "automate-06"

       The output is the command ID only.  Output:

          (None)

              The number of automated backups to keep.

          ServerName -> (string)
              The name of the server.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)

              fied.

          DisableAutomatedBackup -> (boolean)

              main specified.

          Engine -> (string)

              dential  to access the server in EngineAttributes. These creden-
              tials are not stored by AWS OpsWorks CM; they are returned  only
              as part of the result of createServer().
                 Attributes returned in a createServer response for Chef

              o CHEF_AUTOMATE_PIVOTAL_KEY  :  A base64-encoded RSA private key
                that is generated by AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate. This pri-
                vate key is required to access the Chef API.

                file, unzip it, and then change to the directory where  you've
                unzipped  the  file contents. From this directory, you can run
                Knife commands.
