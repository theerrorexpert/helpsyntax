DESCRIBE-SERVERS()                                          DESCRIBE-SERVERS()



NAME
       describe-servers -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  configuration  management  servers that are identified with
       your  account.  Only  the  stored  results  from  Amazon  DynamoDB  are
       returned. AWS OpsWorks CM does not query other services.

       This operation is synchronous.

       A ResourceNotFoundException is thrown when the server does not exist. A
       ValidationException is raised when parameters of the  request  are  not
       valid.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-servers  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Servers

SYNOPSIS
            describe-servers
          [--server-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --server-name (string)
          Describes the server with the specified ServerName.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe servers

       The  following  describe-servers  command returns information about all
       servers that are associated with your  account,  and  in  your  default
       region.:

          aws opsworks-cm describe-servers

       The  output for each server entry returned by the command resembles the
       following.  Output:

OUTPUT
       Servers -> (list)
          Contains the response to a DescribeServers request.
              For     Chef    Automate    servers:    If    DescribeServersRe-
              sponse$Servers$EngineAttributes                         includes
              CHEF_MAJOR_UPGRADE_AVAILABLE,  you can upgrade the Chef Automate
              server to Chef Automate 2. To be eligible for upgrade, a  server
              running  Chef  Automate  1 must have had at least one successful
              maintenance run after November 1, 2019.

              For Puppet  servers:   DescribeServersResponse$Servers$EngineAt-
              tributes contains the following two responses:

          o PUPPET_API_CA_CERT  ,  the PEM-encoded CA certificate that is used
            by the Puppet API over TCP port number 8140. The CA certificate is
            also used to sign node certificates.

          o PUPPET_API_CRL  ,  a  certificate revocation list. The certificate
            revocation list is for internal  maintenance  purposes  only.  For
            more information about the Puppet certificate revocation list, see
            Man Page: puppet certificate_revocation_list in the  Puppet  docu-
            mentation.

          (structure)
              Describes a configuration management server.

              AssociatePublicIpAddress -> (boolean)
                 Associate  a  public  IP  address  with a server that you are
                 launching.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 Time     stamp     of      server      creation.      Example

              CloudFormationStackArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of the CloudFormation stack that was used to create
                 the server.

                 https://aws.my-company.com  . You cannot access the server by
                 using the Endpoint value if the  server  has  a  CustomDomain
                 specified.

              DisableAutomatedBackup -> (boolean)
                 Disables  automated  backups. The number of stored backups is
                 dependent on the value of PreferredBackupCount.

              Endpoint -> (string)
                 A DNS name that can be used to access  the  engine.  Example:
                 myserver-asdfghjkl.us-east-1.opsworks.io  . You cannot access
                 the server by using the Endpoint value if the  server  has  a
                 CustomDomain specified.

              Engine -> (string)
                 The  engine  type of the server. Valid values in this release
                 include ChefAutomate and Puppet .

                 The  response  of a createServer() request returns the master
                 credential to access the server  in  EngineAttributes.  These
                 credentials  are  not  stored  by  AWS  OpsWorks CM; they are
                 returned only as part of the result of createServer().
                     Attributes returned in a createServer response for Chef

                 o CHEF_AUTOMATE_PIVOTAL_KEY : A  base64-encoded  RSA  private
                   key  that  is  generated by AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate.
                   This private key is required to access the Chef API.

                 o CHEF_STARTER_KIT : A base64-encoded ZIP file. The ZIP  file
                   contains  a  Chef  starter  kit, which includes a README, a
                   configuration file, and the required RSA private key.  Save
                   this file, unzip it, and then change to the directory where
                   you've unzipped the file contents. From this directory, you
                   can run Knife commands.

              EngineVersion -> (string)
                 The  engine  version  of  the  server. For a Chef server, the

                 CloudFormation  stack.  These  might not be the same security
                 groups that are shown in the EC2 console.
