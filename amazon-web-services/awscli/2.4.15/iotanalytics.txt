NAME
       iotanalytics -

DESCRIPTION
       IoT  Analytics  allows  you  to  collect  large amounts of device data,
       process messages, and store them. You can then query the data  and  run
       sophisticated  analytics  on  it.  IoT  Analytics enables advanced data
       exploration through integration with Jupyter Notebooks and data visual-
       ization through integration with Amazon QuickSight.

       Traditional  analytics  and business intelligence tools are designed to
       process structured data. IoT data often comes from devices that  record
       noisy  processes  (such  as temperature, motion, or sound). As a result
       the data from these devices can have significant gaps,  corrupted  mes-
       sages,  and  false readings that must be cleaned up before analysis can
       occur. Also, IoT data is often only meaningful in the context of  other
       data from external sources.

       IoT  Analytics  automates  the  steps required to analyze data from IoT
       devices. IoT Analytics  filters,  transforms,  and  enriches  IoT  data
       before storing it in a time-series data store for analysis. You can set
       up the service to collect only the data you  need  from  your  devices,
       apply  mathematical transforms to process the data, and enrich the data
       with device-specific metadata such as device type and  location  before
       storing  it.  Then,  you can analyze your data by running queries using
       the built-in SQL query engine, or perform more  complex  analytics  and
       machine learning inference. IoT Analytics includes pre-built models for
       common IoT use cases so you can answer questions like which devices are
       about  to fail or which customers are at risk of abandoning their wear-
       able devices.
