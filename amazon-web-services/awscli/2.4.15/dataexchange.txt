NAME
       dataexchange -

DESCRIPTION
       AWS  Data Exchange is a service that makes it easy for AWS customers to
       exchange data in the cloud. You can use the AWS Data Exchange  APIs  to
       create,  update,  manage,  and  access  file-based  data set in the AWS
       Cloud.

       As a subscriber, you can view and access the data sets that you have an
       entitlement to through a subscription. You can use the APIS to download
       or copy your entitled data sets to Amazon S3 for use across  a  variety
       of AWS analytics and machine learning services.

       As  a provider, you can create and manage your data sets that you would
       like to publish to a product. Being able to package  and  provide  your
       data  sets into products requires a few steps to determine eligibility.
       For more information, visit the AWS Data Exchange User Guide.

       A data set is a collection of data that can be changed or updated  over
       time.  Data  sets can be updated using revisions, which represent a new
       version or incremental change to a data set. A revision contains one or
       more  assets. An asset in AWS Data Exchange is a piece of data that can
       be stored as an Amazon S3 object. The asset can be  a  structured  data
       file,  an  image  file,  or some other data file. Jobs are asynchronous
       import or export operations used to create or copy assets.
