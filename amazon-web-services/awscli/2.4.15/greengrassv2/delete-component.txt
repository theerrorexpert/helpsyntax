DELETE-COMPONENT()                                          DELETE-COMPONENT()



NAME
       delete-component -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a version of a component from IoT Greengrass.

       NOTE:
          This  operation  deletes  the component's recipe and artifacts. As a
          result, deployments that refer to this component version will  fail.
          If  you  have  deployments  that use this component version, you can
          remove the component from the deployment or update the deployment to
          use a valid version.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-component
          --arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The ARN of the component version.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a component version

       The following delete-component example deletes a Hello World component.

          aws greengrassv2 delete-component \
              --arn arn:aws:greengrass:us-west-2:123456789012:components:com.example.HelloWorld:versions:1.0.0

       This command produces no output.

       V2 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
