BATCH-DISASSOCIATE-CLIENT-DBATCH-DISASSOCIATE-CLIENT-DEVICE-FROM-CORE-DEVICE()



NAME
       batch-disassociate-client-device-from-core-device -

DESCRIPTION
       Disassociates  a  list  of client devices from a core device. After you
       disassociate a client device from a  core  device,  the  client  device
       won't be able to use cloud discovery to retrieve the core device's con-
       nectivity information and certificates.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-disassociate-client-device-from-core-device
          [--entries <value>]
          --core-device-thing-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --entries (list)
          The list of client devices to disassociate.

          (structure)
              Contains a request to disassociate a client device from  a  core
              device.  The  BatchDisassociateClientDeviceWithCoreDevice opera-
              tion consumes a list of these requests.

              thingName -> (string)
                 The name of the IoT thing that represents the  client  device
                 to disassociate.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          thingName=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "thingName": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --core-device-thing-name (string)
          The name of the core device. This is also the name of the IoT thing.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To disassociate client devices from a core device

       The following batch-disassociate-client-device-from-core-device example
       disassociates two client devices from a core device.

          aws greengrassv2 batch-disassociate-client-device-from-core-device \
            --core-device-thing-name MyGreengrassCore \
            --entries thingName=MyClientDevice1 thingName=MyClientDevice2

       Output:

          {
              "errorEntries": []
          }

       For  more  information,  see Interact with local IoT devices in the AWS
       IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       errorEntries -> (list)
          The list of any errors for the entries in the  request.  Each  error
          entry  contains  the name of the IoT thing that failed to disassoci-
          ate.

          (structure)
              Contains an error that occurs from a request to  disassociate  a
              client      device      from      a     core     device.     The
              BatchDisassociateClientDeviceWithCoreDevice operation returns  a
              list of these errors.

              thingName -> (string)
                 The  name of the IoT thing whose disassociate request failed.

              code -> (string)
                 The error code for the request.

              message -> (string)
                 A message that  provides  additional  information  about  the
                 error.
