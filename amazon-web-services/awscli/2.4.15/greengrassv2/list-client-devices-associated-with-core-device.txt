LIST-CLIENT-DEVICES-ASSOCIATELIST-CLIENT-DEVICES-ASSOCIATED-WITH-CORE-DEVICE()



NAME
       list-client-devices-associated-with-core-device -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a paginated list of client devices that are associated with a
       core device.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-client-devices-associated-with-core-device is a  paginated  opera-
       tion.  Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire
       data set of results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by  providing  the
       --no-paginate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argu-
       ment on a paginated response, the --query argument  must  extract  data
       from  the results of the following query expressions: associatedClient-
       Devices

SYNOPSIS
            list-client-devices-associated-with-core-device
          --core-device-thing-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --core-device-thing-name (string)
          The name of the core device. This is also the name of the IoT thing.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the client devices associated with a core device

       The following  list-client-devices-associated-with-core-device  example
       lists all client devices associated with a core device.

          aws greengrassv2 list-client-devices-associated-with-core-device \
            --core-device-thing-name MyTestGreengrassCore

       Output:

          {
              "associatedClientDevices": [
                  {
                      "thingName": "MyClientDevice2",
                      "associationTimestamp": "2021-07-12T16:33:55.843000-07:00"
                  },
                  {
                      "thingName": "MyClientDevice1",
                      "associationTimestamp": "2021-07-12T16:33:55.843000-07:00"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       associatedClientDevices -> (list)
          A list that describes the client devices that  are  associated  with
          the core device.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a client device that is associated to
              a core device for cloud discovery.

              thingName -> (string)
                 The name of the IoT  thing  that  represents  the  associated
                 client device.

              associationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The  time that the client device was associated, expressed in
                 ISO 8601 format.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results, or null if there are no addi-
          tional results.
