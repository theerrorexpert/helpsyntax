DELETE-CORE-DEVICE()                                      DELETE-CORE-DEVICE()



NAME
       delete-core-device -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a Greengrass core device, which is an IoT thing. This operation
       removes the core device from the list of core devices.  This  operation
       doesn't  delete the IoT thing. For more information about how to delete
       the IoT thing, see DeleteThing in the IoT API Reference .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-core-device
          --core-device-thing-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --core-device-thing-name (string)
          The name of the core device. This is also the name of the IoT thing.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a core device

       The  following delete-core-device example deletes an AWS IoT Greengrass
       core device.

          aws greengrassv2 delete-core-device \
              --core-device-thing-name MyGreengrassCore

       This command produces no output.

       For more information, see Uninstall the AWS IoT Greengrass  Core  soft-
       ware in the AWS IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
