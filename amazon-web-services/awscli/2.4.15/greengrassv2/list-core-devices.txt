LIST-CORE-DEVICES()                                        LIST-CORE-DEVICES()



NAME
       list-core-devices -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a paginated list of Greengrass core devices.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-core-devices  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: coreDevices

SYNOPSIS
            list-core-devices
          [--thing-group-arn <value>]
          [--status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --thing-group-arn (string)
          The ARN of the IoT thing group by which to filter.  If  you  specify
          this parameter, the list includes only core devices that are members
          of this thing group.

       --status (string)
          The core device status by which  to  filter.  If  you  specify  this
          parameter,  the  list includes only core devices that have this sta-
          tus. Choose one of the following options:

          o HEALTHY  The IoT Greengrass Core software and all  components  run
            on the core device without issue.

          o UNHEALTHY  The IoT Greengrass Core software or a component is in a
            failed state on the core device.

          Possible values:

          o HEALTHY

          o UNHEALTHY

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list core devices

       The  following  list-core-devices  example lists the AWS IoT Greengrass
       core devices in your AWS account in the current Region.

          aws greengrassv2 list-core-devices

       Output:

          {
              "coreDevices": [
                  {
                      "coreDeviceThingName": "MyGreengrassCore",
                      "status": "HEALTHY",
                      "lastStatusUpdateTimestamp": "2021-01-08T04:57:58.838000-08:00"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Greengrass V2 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       coreDevices -> (list)
          A list that summarizes each core device.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a Greengrass core device, which is an
              IoT thing that runs the IoT Greengrass Core software.

              coreDeviceThingName -> (string)
                 The name of the core device. This is also the name of the IoT
                 thing.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the core device. Core devices can have the fol-
                 lowing statuses:

                 o HEALTHY  The IoT Greengrass Core software  and  all  compo-
                   nents run on the core device without issue.

                 o UNHEALTHY   The IoT Greengrass Core software or a component
                   is in a failed state on the core device.

              lastStatusUpdateTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the  core  device's  status  last  updated,
                 expressed in ISO 8601 format.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results, or null if there are no addi-
          tional results.
