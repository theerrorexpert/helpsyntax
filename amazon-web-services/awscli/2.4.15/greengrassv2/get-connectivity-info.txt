GET-CONNECTIVITY-INFO()                                GET-CONNECTIVITY-INFO()



NAME
       get-connectivity-info -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves connectivity information for a Greengrass core device.

       Connectivity  information  includes  endpoints  and  ports where client
       devices can connect to an MQTT broker on the core device. When a client
       device calls the Greengrass discovery API , IoT Greengrass returns con-
       nectivity information for all of the  core  devices  where  the  client
       device can connect. For more information, see Connect client devices to
       core devices in the IoT Greengrass Version 2 Developer Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-connectivity-info
          --thing-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --thing-name (string)
          The name of the core device. This is also the name of the IoT thing.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       connectivityInfo -> (list)
          The connectivity information for the core device.

          (structure)
              Contains  information  about  an  endpoint and port where client
              devices can connect to an  MQTT  broker  on  a  Greengrass  core
              device.

              id -> (string)
                 An ID for the connectivity information.

              hostAddress -> (string)
                 The  IP  address or DNS address where client devices can con-
                 nect to an MQTT broker on the Greengrass core device.

              portNumber -> (integer)
                 The port where the MQTT broker operates on the  core  device.
                 This  port  is  typically 8883, which is the default port for
                 the MQTT broker component that runs on core devices.

              metadata -> (string)
                 Additional metadata to provide to client devices that connect
                 to this core device.

       message -> (string)
          A message about the connectivity information request.
