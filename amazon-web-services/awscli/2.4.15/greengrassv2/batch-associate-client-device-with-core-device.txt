BATCH-ASSOCIATE-CLIENT-DEVICE-BATCH-ASSOCIATE-CLIENT-DEVICE-WITH-CORE-DEVICE()



NAME
       batch-associate-client-device-with-core-device -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  a  list  of client devices with a core device. Use this API
       operation to specify which client devices can discover  a  core  device
       through  cloud  discovery. With cloud discovery, client devices connect
       to IoT Greengrass to retrieve  associated  core  devices'  connectivity
       information and certificates. For more information, see Configure cloud
       discovery in the IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide .

       NOTE:
          Client devices are local IoT devices that connect to and communicate
          with an IoT Greengrass core device over MQTT. You can connect client
          devices to a core device to sync MQTT messages and  data  to  Amazon
          Web Services IoT Core and interact with client devices in Greengrass
          components. For  more  information,  see  Interact  with  local  IoT
          devices in the IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            batch-associate-client-device-with-core-device
          [--entries <value>]
          --core-device-thing-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --entries (list)
          The list of client devices to associate.

          (structure)
              Contains  a  request  to  associate  a client device with a core
              device. The  BatchAssociateClientDeviceWithCoreDevice  operation
              consumes a list of these requests.

              thingName -> (string)
                 The  name  of the IoT thing that represents the client device
                 to associate.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          thingName=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "thingName": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --core-device-thing-name (string)
          The name of the core device. This is also the name of the IoT thing.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To associate client devices with a core device

       The  following  batch-associate-client-device-with-core-device  example
       associates two client devices with a core device.

          aws greengrassv2 batch-associate-client-device-with-core-device \
            --core-device-thing-name MyGreengrassCore \
            --entries thingName=MyClientDevice1 thingName=MyClientDevice2

       Output:

          {
              "errorEntries": []
          }

       For more information, see Interact with local IoT devices  in  the  AWS
       IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       errorEntries -> (list)
          The  list  of  any errors for the entries in the request. Each error
          entry contains the name of the IoT thing that failed to associate.

          (structure)
              Contains an error that occurs from  a  request  to  associate  a
              client      device      with      a     core     device.     The
              BatchAssociateClientDeviceWithCoreDevice  operation  returns   a
              list of these errors.

              thingName -> (string)
                 The name of the IoT thing whose associate request failed.

              code -> (string)
                 The error code for the request.

              message -> (string)
                 A  message  that  provides  additional  information about the
                 error.
