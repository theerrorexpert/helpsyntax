GET-CORE-DEVICE()                                            GET-CORE-DEVICE()



NAME
       get-core-device -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves metadata for a Greengrass core device.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-core-device
          --core-device-thing-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --core-device-thing-name (string)
          The name of the core device. This is also the name of the IoT thing.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get a core device

       The following get-core-device example gets information about an AWS IoT
       Greengrass core device.

          aws greengrassv2 get-core-device \
              --core-device-thing-name MyGreengrassCore

       Output:

          {
              "coreDeviceThingName": "MyGreengrassCore",
              "coreVersion": "2.0.3",
              "platform": "linux",
              "architecture": "amd64",
              "status": "HEALTHY",
              "lastStatusUpdateTimestamp": "2021-01-08T04:57:58.838000-08:00",
              "tags": {}
          }

       Greengrass V2 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       coreDeviceThingName -> (string)
          The name of the core device. This is also the name of the IoT thing.

       coreVersion -> (string)
          The version of the IoT Greengrass Core software that the core device
          runs. This version is equivalent to the version  of  the  Greengrass
          nucleus  component  that  runs on the core device. For more informa-
          tion, see the Greengrass nucleus component in the IoT Greengrass  V2
          Developer Guide .

       platform -> (string)
          The operating system platform that the core device runs.

       architecture -> (string)
          The computer architecture of the core device.

       status -> (string)
          The status of the core device. The core device status can be:

          o HEALTHY   The  IoT Greengrass Core software and all components run
            on the core device without issue.

          o UNHEALTHY  The IoT Greengrass Core software or a component is in a
            failed state on the core device.

       lastStatusUpdateTimestamp -> (timestamp)
          The  time  at which the core device's status last updated, expressed
          in ISO 8601 format.

       tags -> (map)
          A list of key-value pairs that contain metadata  for  the  resource.
          For  more  information, see Tag your resources in the IoT Greengrass
          V2 Developer Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)
