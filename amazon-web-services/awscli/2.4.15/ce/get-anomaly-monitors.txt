NAME
       get-anomaly-monitors -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  cost  anomaly monitor definitions for your account. You
       can filter using a list of cost anomaly monitor Amazon  Resource  Names
       (ARNs).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-anomaly-monitors
          [--monitor-arn-list <value>]
          [--next-page-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --monitor-arn-list (list)
          A list of cost anomaly monitor ARNs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --next-page-token (string)
          The  token  to retrieve the next set of results. Amazon Web Services
          provides the token when the response from a previous call  has  more
          results than the maximum page size.

       --max-results (integer)
          The number of entries that a paginated response contains.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              LastEvaluatedDate -> (string)
                 The date when the monitor last evaluated for anomalies.

              MonitorType -> (string)
                 The possible type values.

              MonitorDimension -> (string)
                 The dimensions to evaluate.

              MonitorSpecification -> (structure)
                 Use  Expression  to filter by cost or by usage. There are two
                 patterns:

                 o Simple dimension values - You can set  the  dimension  name
                   and  values for the filters that you plan to use. For exam-
                   ple,   you   can   filter    for    REGION==us-east-1    OR
                   REGION==us-west-1  . For GetRightsizingRecommendation , the
                   Region is a full name (for  example,  REGION==US  East  (N.
                   Virginia)  .  The  Expression  example  is  as  follows:  {
                   "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values":  [  "us-east-1",
                   us-west-1  ]  }  }    The list of dimension values are OR'd
                   together to retrieve cost or usage  data.  You  can  create
                   Expression  and  DimensionValues objects using either with*
                   methods or set* methods in multiple lines.

                 o Compound dimension values with logical operations - You can
                   use  multiple  Expression  types  and the logical operators
                   AND/OR/NOT to create a  list  of  one  or  more  Expression
                   objects.  By  doing  this,  you can filter on more advanced
                   options.  For  example,  you  can  filter  on  ((REGION  ==
                   us-east-1  OR  REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type == Type1))
                   AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer) . The Expression for  that
                   is as follows:  { "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key":
                   "REGION",  "Values":  [  "us-east-1",  "us-west-1"  ]   }},
                   {"Tags":  {  "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]},
                   {"Not": {"Dimensions":  {  "Key":  "USAGE_TYPE",  "Values":
                   ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }

                 NOTE:
                        Because  each  Expression  can have only one operator,
                        the service returns an error if more than one is spec-
                        ified.  The  following  example  shows  an  Expression
                        object that creates an error.

                     { "And":  [  ...  ],  "DimensionValues":  {  "Dimension":
                     "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

                 NOTE:
                     For  the  GetRightsizingRecommendation action, a combina-
                     tion of OR and NOT isn't supported.  OR  isn't  supported
                     between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT
                     operators aren't supported. Dimensions are  also  limited
                     to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

                     For the GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation action, only
                     NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions
                     are limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

                 Or -> (list)
                     Return results that match either Dimension object.

                     (structure)
                        Use  Expression  to  filter by cost or by usage. There
                        are two patterns:

                        o Simple dimension values - You can set the  dimension
                          name  and  values  for  the filters that you plan to
                          use.   For   example,    you    can    filter    for
                          REGION==us-east-1   OR   REGION==us-west-1   .   For
                          GetRightsizingRecommendation , the Region is a  full
                          name  (for  example, REGION==US East (N. Virginia) .
                          The Expression example is  as  follows:   {  "Dimen-
                          sions":  { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1",
                          us-west-1 ] } }   The list of dimension  values  are
                          OR'd  together  to  retrieve cost or usage data. You
                          can create Expression  and  DimensionValues  objects
                          using either with* methods or set* methods in multi-
                          ple lines.

                        o Compound dimension values with logical operations  -
                          You  can use multiple Expression types and the logi-
                          cal operators AND/OR/NOT to create a list of one  or
                          more Expression objects. By doing this, you can fil-
                          ter on more advanced options. For example,  you  can
                          filter   on  ((REGION  ==  us-east-1  OR  REGION  ==
                          us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type == Type1))  AND  (USAGE_TYPE
                          !=  DataTransfer)  .  The  Expression for that is as
                          follows:  {  "And":  [  {"Or":  [  {"Dimensions":  {
                          "Key":    "REGION",    "Values":    [   "us-east-1",
                          "us-west-1" ] }}, {"Tags": { "Key": "TagName", "Val-
                          ues":  ["Value1"]  }  } ]}, {"Not": {"Dimensions": {
                          "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": ["DataTransfer"]  }}}
                          ] }

                        NOTE:
                               Because each Expression can have only one oper-
                               ator, the service returns an error if more than
                               one  is  specified. The following example shows
                               an Expression object that creates an error.

                            { "And": [ ...  ],  "DimensionValues":  {  "Dimen-
                            sion":  "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ]
                            } }

                        NOTE:
                            For  the  GetRightsizingRecommendation  action,  a
                            combination  of  OR  and  NOT  isn't supported. OR
                            isn't supported between different  dimensions,  or
                            dimensions  and  tags.  NOT  operators aren't sup-
                            ported.   Dimensions   are   also    limited    to
                            LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

                            For    the    GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation
                            action, only NOT is supported. AND and  OR  aren't
                            supported.     Dimensions     are    limited    to
                            LINKED_ACCOUNT .

                        Or -> (list)
                            Return results that match either Dimension object.

                            ( ... recursive ... )

                        And -> (list)
                            Return  results that match both Dimension objects.

                            ( ... recursive ... )

                        ( ... recursive ... )Dimensions -> (structure)
                            The specific Dimension to use for Expression .

                            Key -> (string)
                               The names of the metadata types  that  you  can
                               use to filter and group your results. For exam-
                               ple, AZ returns a list of Availability Zones.

                            Values -> (list)
                               The metadata values that you can use to  filter
                               and  group  your results. You can use GetDimen-
                               sionValues to find specific values.

                               your  results.  MatchOptions is only applicable
                               for  actions  related  to  Cost  Category.  The
                               default  values for MatchOptions are EQUALS and
