GET-ANOMALY-SUBSCRIPTIONS()                        GET-ANOMALY-SUBSCRIPTIONS()



NAME
       get-anomaly-subscriptions -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  cost anomaly subscription objects for your account. You
       can filter using a list of cost anomaly monitor Amazon  Resource  Names
       (ARNs).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-anomaly-subscriptions
          [--subscription-arn-list <value>]
          [--monitor-arn <value>]
          [--next-page-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subscription-arn-list (list)
          A list of cost anomaly subscription ARNs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --monitor-arn (string)
          Cost anomaly monitor ARNs.

       --next-page-token (string)
          The  token  to retrieve the next set of results. Amazon Web Services
          provides the token when the response from a previous call  has  more
          results than the maximum page size.

       --max-results (integer)
          The number of entries a paginated response contains.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AnomalySubscriptions -> (list)
          A  list  of  cost  anomaly  subscriptions that includes the detailed
          metadata for each one.

          (structure)
              The association between a monitor, threshold, and list  of  sub-
              scribers  used to deliver notifications about anomalies detected
              by a monitor that exceeds a threshold. The content  consists  of
              the  detailed metadata and the current status of the AnomalySub-
              scription object.

              SubscriptionArn -> (string)
                 The AnomalySubscription Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

              AccountId -> (string)
                 Your unique account identifier.

              MonitorArnList -> (list)
                 A list of cost anomaly monitors.

                 (string)

              Subscribers -> (list)
                 A list of subscribers to notify.

                 (structure)
                     The recipient of AnomalySubscription notifications.

                     Address -> (string)
                        The email address or SNS Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN).
                        This depends on the Type .

                     Type -> (string)
                        The notification delivery channel.

                     Status -> (string)
                        Indicates if the subscriber accepts the notifications.

              Threshold -> (double)
                 The dollar value that triggers a notification if the  thresh-
                 old is exceeded.

              Frequency -> (string)
                 The frequency that anomaly reports are sent over email.

              SubscriptionName -> (string)
                 The name for the subscription.

       NextPageToken -> (string)
          The  token  to retrieve the next set of results. Amazon Web Services
          provides the token when the response from a previous call  has  more
          results than the maximum page size.
