SYNOPSIS
            get-cost-categories
          [--search-string <value>]
          --time-period <value>
          [--cost-category-name <value>]
          [--filter <value>]
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-page-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --search-string (string)
          The value that you want to search the filter values for.

          If you do not specify a CostCategoryName , SearchString will be used
          to  filter  Cost Category names that match the SearchString pattern.
          If you do specifiy a CostCategoryName , SearchString will be used to
          filter Cost Category values that match the SearchString pattern.

       --time-period (structure)
          The time period of the request.

          Start -> (string)
              The  beginning  of the time period. The start date is inclusive.
              For example, if  start  is  2017-01-01  ,  Amazon  Web  Services
              retrieves  cost  and usage data starting at 2017-01-01 up to the
              end date. The start date must be equal to or no later  than  the
              current date to avoid a validation error.

          End -> (string)
              The end of the time period. The end date is exclusive. For exam-
              ple, if end is 2017-05-01 , Amazon Web Services  retrieves  cost
              and  usage  data  from  the start date up to, but not including,
              2017-05-01 .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Start=string,End=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Start": "string",
            "End": "string"
          }

       --cost-category-name (string)
          The unique name of the Cost Category.

       --filter (structure)
          Use Expression to filter by cost or by usage.  There  are  two  pat-
          terns:

          o Simple  dimension values - You can set the dimension name and val-
            ues for the filters that you plan to use.  For  example,  you  can
            filter  for REGION==us-east-1 OR REGION==us-west-1 . For GetRight-
            sizingRecommendation , the Region is a  full  name  (for  example,
            REGION==US  East (N. Virginia) . The Expression example is as fol-
            lows:  { "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1",
            us-west-1  ]  } }   The list of dimension values are OR'd together
            to retrieve cost or usage data.  You  can  create  Expression  and
            DimensionValues objects using either with* methods or set* methods
            in multiple lines.

          o Compound dimension values with logical operations -  You  can  use
            multiple  Expression types and the logical operators AND/OR/NOT to
            create a list of one or more Expression objects.  By  doing  this,
            you can filter on more advanced options. For example, you can fil-
            ter on ((REGION == us-east-1 OR REGION == us-west-1) OR  (TAG.Type
            ==  Type1))  AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer) . The Expression for
            that is as follows:  { "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions":  {  "Key":
            "REGION",  "Values":  [  "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] }}, {"Tags": {
            "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } }  ]},  {"Not":  {"Dimen-
            sions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }

          NOTE:
                 Because  each Expression can have only one operator, the ser-
                 vice returns an error if more than one is specified. The fol-
                 lowing  example  shows  an  Expression object that creates an
                 error.

              {  "And":   [   ...   ],   "DimensionValues":   {   "Dimension":
              "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

          NOTE:
              For the GetRightsizingRecommendation action, a combination of OR
              and NOT isn't supported. OR isn't  supported  between  different
              dimensions,  or  dimensions  and tags. NOT operators aren't sup-
              ported. Dimensions are also limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION ,
              or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

              For the GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation action, only NOT is
              supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions  are  limited
              to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

          Or -> (list)
              Return results that match either Dimension object.

              (structure)
                 Use  Expression  to filter by cost or by usage. There are two
                 patterns:

                 o Simple dimension values - You can set  the  dimension  name
                   and  values for the filters that you plan to use. For exam-
                   ple,   you   can   filter    for    REGION==us-east-1    OR
                   REGION==us-west-1  . For GetRightsizingRecommendation , the
                   Region is a full name (for  example,  REGION==US  East  (N.
                   Virginia)  .  The  Expression  example  is  as  follows:  {
                   "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values":  [  "us-east-1",
                   us-west-1  ]  }  }    The list of dimension values are OR'd
                   together to retrieve cost or usage  data.  You  can  create
                   Expression  and  DimensionValues objects using either with*
                   methods or set* methods in multiple lines.

                 o Compound dimension values with logical operations - You can
                   use  multiple  Expression  types  and the logical operators
                   AND/OR/NOT to create a  list  of  one  or  more  Expression
                   objects.  By  doing  this,  you can filter on more advanced
                   options.  For  example,  you  can  filter  on  ((REGION  ==
                   us-east-1  OR  REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type == Type1))
                   AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer) . The Expression for  that
                   is as follows:  { "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key":
                   "REGION",  "Values":  [  "us-east-1",  "us-west-1"  ]   }},
                   {"Tags":  {  "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]},
                   {"Not": {"Dimensions":  {  "Key":  "USAGE_TYPE",  "Values":
                   ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }

                 NOTE:
                        Because  each  Expression  can have only one operator,
                        the service returns an error if more than one is spec-
                        ified.  The  following  example  shows  an  Expression
                        object that creates an error.

                     { "And":  [  ...  ],  "DimensionValues":  {  "Dimension":
                     "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

                 NOTE:
                     For  the  GetRightsizingRecommendation action, a combina-
                     tion of OR and NOT isn't supported.  OR  isn't  supported
                     between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT
                     operators aren't supported. Dimensions are  also  limited
                     to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

                     For the GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation action, only
                     NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions
                     are limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

              (structure)
                 Use Expression to filter by cost or by usage. There  are  two
                 patterns:

                 o Simple  dimension  values  - You can set the dimension name
                   and values for the filters that you plan to use. For  exam-
                   ple,    you    can    filter   for   REGION==us-east-1   OR
                   REGION==us-west-1 . For GetRightsizingRecommendation ,  the
                   Region  is  a  full  name (for example, REGION==US East (N.
                   Virginia) .  The  Expression  example  is  as  follows:   {
                   "Dimensions":  {  "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1",
                   us-west-1 ] } }   The list of  dimension  values  are  OR'd
                   together  to  retrieve  cost  or usage data. You can create
                   Expression and DimensionValues objects using  either  with*
                   methods or set* methods in multiple lines.

                 o Compound dimension values with logical operations - You can
                   use multiple Expression types  and  the  logical  operators
                   AND/OR/NOT  to  create  a  list  of  one or more Expression
                   objects. By doing this, you can  filter  on  more  advanced
                   options.  For  example,  you  can  filter  on  ((REGION  ==
                   us-east-1 OR REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type  ==  Type1))
                   AND  (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer) . The Expression for that
                   is as follows:  { "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key":
                   "REGION",   "Values":  [  "us-east-1",  "us-west-1"  ]  }},

       --sort-by (list)
          The value by which you want to sort the data.

          The  key represents cost and usage metrics. The following values are
          supported:

          o BlendedCost

          o UnblendedCost

          o AmortizedCost

          o NetAmortizedCost

          o NetUnblendedCost

          o UsageQuantity

          o NormalizedUsageAmount

          Supported values for SortOrder are ASCENDING or DESCENDING .

          When using SortBy , NextPageToken  and  SearchString  are  not  sup-
          ported.

          (structure)
              The details of how to sort the data.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key that's used to sort the data.

              SortOrder -> (string)
                 The order that's used to sort the data.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,SortOrder=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "SortOrder": "ASCENDING"|"DESCENDING"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          This field is only used when SortBy is provided in the request.

          The  maximum number of objects that to be returned for this request.
          If MaxResults is not specified with SortBy , the request will return
          1000 results as the default value for this parameter.

          For GetCostCategories , MaxResults has an upper limit of 1000.

       --next-page-token (string)
          If  the  number  of  objects  that are still available for retrieval
          exceeds the limit, Amazon Web Services returns a NextPageToken value
          in  the response. To retrieve the next batch of objects, provide the
          NextPageToken from the prior call in your next request.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
