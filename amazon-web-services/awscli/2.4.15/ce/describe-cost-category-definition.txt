NAME
       describe-cost-category-definition -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the name, ARN, rules, definition, and effective dates of a Cost
       Category that's defined in the account.

       You have the option to use EffectiveOn to return a Cost  Category  that
       is  active  on  a  specific date. If there is no EffectiveOn specified,
       youll see a Cost Category that is effective on  the  current  date.  If
       Cost  Category  is  still  effective,  EffectiveEnd  is  omitted in the
       response.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-cost-category-definition
          --cost-category-arn <value>
          [--effective-on <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cost-category-arn (string)
          The unique identifier for your Cost Category.

       --effective-on (string)
          The date when the Cost Category was effective.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CostCategory -> (structure)
          The structure of Cost Categories. This  includes  detailed  metadata
          and the set of rules for the CostCategory object.

          CostCategoryArn -> (string)
              The unique identifier for your Cost Category.

          EffectiveStart -> (string)
              The effective state data of your Cost Category.

          EffectiveEnd -> (string)
              The effective end data of your Cost Category.

          Name -> (string)
              The unique name of the Cost Category.

          RuleVersion -> (string)
              The rule schema version in this particular Cost Category.

          Rules -> (list)
              The  rules  are  processed in order. If there are multiple rules
              that match the line item, then the first rule to match  is  used
              to determine that Cost Category value.

              (structure)
                 Rules  are  processed  in  order. If there are multiple rules
                 that match the line item, then the first  rule  to  match  is
                 used to determine that Cost Category value.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The default value for the cost category.

                 Rule -> (structure)
                     An  Expression object used to categorize costs. This sup-
                     ports dimensions, tags, and nested expressions. Currently
                     the  only  dimensions supported are LINKED_ACCOUNT , SER-
                     VICE_CODE , RECORD_TYPE , and LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME .

                     Root level OR isn't supported. We recommend that you cre-
                     ate a separate rule instead.
                        RECORD_TYPE  is  a  dimension  used  for Cost Explorer
                        APIs, and is also supported for Cost Category  expres-
                        sions.  This dimension uses different terms, depending
                        on whether you're using the console or  API/JSON  edi-
                        tor.  For  a detailed comparison, see Term Comparisons
                        in the Billing and Cost Management User Guide .

                     Or -> (list)
                        Return results that match either Dimension object.

                        (structure)
                            Use Expression to filter  by  cost  or  by  usage.
                            There are two patterns:

                            o Simple dimension values - You can set the dimen-
                              sion name and values for the  filters  that  you
                              plan  to  use.  For  example, you can filter for
                              REGION==us-east-1  OR  REGION==us-west-1  .  For
                              GetRightsizingRecommendation  ,  the Region is a
                              full name (for example, REGION==US East (N. Vir-
                              ginia)  .  The Expression example is as follows:
                              { "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION",  "Values":  [
                              "us-east-1",  us-west-1  ]  }  }    The  list of
                              dimension values are OR'd together  to  retrieve
                              cost  or  usage  data. You can create Expression
                              and DimensionValues objects using  either  with*
                              methods or set* methods in multiple lines.

                            o Compound  dimension  values  with logical opera-
                              tions - You can use  multiple  Expression  types
                              and the logical operators AND/OR/NOT to create a
                              list of one or more Expression objects. By doing
                              this,  you  can filter on more advanced options.
                              For example,  you  can  filter  on  ((REGION  ==
                              us-east-1  OR  REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type
                              == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE  !=  DataTransfer)  .
                              The Expression for that is as follows:  { "And":
                              [ {"Or": [  {"Dimensions":  {  "Key":  "REGION",
                              "Values":   [  "us-east-1",  "us-west-1"  ]  }},
                              {"Tags":   {   "Key":    "TagName",    "Values":
                              ["Value1"]  }  }  ]},  {"Not":  {"Dimensions": {
                              "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values":  ["DataTransfer"]
                              }}} ] }

                            NOTE:
                                   Because  each  Expression can have only one
                                   operator, the service returns an  error  if
                                   more  than  one is specified. The following
                                   example shows  an  Expression  object  that
                                   creates an error.

                               {  "And": [ ... ], "DimensionValues": { "Dimen-
                               sion": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer"
                               ] } }

                            NOTE:
                               For  the GetRightsizingRecommendation action, a
                               combination of OR and NOT isn't  supported.  OR
                               isn't  supported  between different dimensions,
                               or dimensions and tags.  NOT  operators  aren't
                               supported.   Dimensions  are  also  limited  to
                               LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

                               For   the  GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation
                               action, only  NOT  is  supported.  AND  and  OR
                               aren't  supported.  Dimensions  are  limited to
                               LINKED_ACCOUNT .

                            Or -> (list)
                               Return  results  that  match  either  Dimension
                               object.

                               ( ... recursive ... )

                            And -> (list)
                               Return   results   that  match  both  Dimension
                               objects.

                               ( ... recursive ... )

                            ( ... recursive ... )Dimensions -> (structure)
                               The specific Dimension to use for Expression  .

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The  names  of  the metadata types that you
                                   can use to filter and group  your  results.
                                   For  example,  AZ  returns a list of Avail-
                                   ability Zones.

                               Values -> (list)
                                   The metadata values that  you  can  use  to
                                   filter  and group your results. You can use
                                   GetDimensionValues to find specific values.

                                   (string)

                                   applicable for actions related to Cost Cat-
                                   egory. The default values for  MatchOptions
                                   are EQUALS and CASE_SENSITIVE .

                            Tags -> (structure)
                               The specific Tag to use for Expression .

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The key for the tag.

                               Values -> (list)
                                   The specific value of the tag.

                               The filter that's based on CostCategory values.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The unique name of the Cost Category.

                               Values -> (list)
                                   The specific value of the Cost Category.

                        (structure)
                            Use Expression to filter  by  cost  or  by  usage.
                            There are two patterns:

                            o Simple dimension values - You can set the dimen-
                              sion name and values for the  filters  that  you
                              plan  to  use.  For  example, you can filter for
                              REGION==us-east-1  OR  REGION==us-west-1  .  For
                              GetRightsizingRecommendation  ,  the Region is a
                              full name (for example, REGION==US East (N. Vir-
                              ginia)  .  The Expression example is as follows:
                              { "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION",  "Values":  [
                              "us-east-1",  us-west-1  ]  }  }    The  list of
                              dimension values are OR'd together  to  retrieve
                              cost  or  usage  data. You can create Expression
                              and DimensionValues objects using  either  with*
                              methods or set* methods in multiple lines.

                            o Compound  dimension  values  with logical opera-
                              tions - You can use  multiple  Expression  types
                              and the logical operators AND/OR/NOT to create a
                              list of one or more Expression objects. By doing
                              this,  you  can filter on more advanced options.
                              For example,  you  can  filter  on  ((REGION  ==
                              us-east-1  OR  REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type
                              == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE  !=  DataTransfer)  .
                              The Expression for that is as follows:  { "And":
                              [ {"Or": [  {"Dimensions":  {  "Key":  "REGION",
                              "Values":   [  "us-east-1",  "us-west-1"  ]  }},
                              {"Tags":   {   "Key":    "TagName",    "Values":
                              ["Value1"]  }  }  ]},  {"Not":  {"Dimensions": {
                              "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values":  ["DataTransfer"]
                              }}} ] }

                            NOTE:
                                   Because  each  Expression can have only one
                                   operator, the service returns an  error  if
                                   more  than  one is specified. The following
                                   example shows  an  Expression  object  that
                                   creates an error.

                               {  "And": [ ... ], "DimensionValues": { "Dimen-
                               sion": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer"
