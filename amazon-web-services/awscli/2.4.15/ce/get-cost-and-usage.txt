GET-COST-AND-USAGE()                                      GET-COST-AND-USAGE()



NAME
       get-cost-and-usage -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  cost  and  usage  metrics  for your account. You can specify
       which cost and usage-related  metric  that  you  want  the  request  to
       return.  For  example,  you can specify BlendedCosts or UsageQuantity .
       You can also filter and group your data by various dimensions, such  as
       SERVICE  or AZ , in a specific time range. For a complete list of valid
       dimensions, see the GetDimensionValues operation. Management account in
       an organization in Organizations have access to all member accounts.

       For  information  about filter limitations, see Quotas and restrictions
       in the Billing and Cost Management User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            get-cost-and-usage
          --time-period <value>
          --granularity <value>
          [--filter <value>]
          --metrics <value>
          [--group-by <value>]
          [--next-page-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --time-period (structure)
          Sets the start date and end date for retrieving Amazon Web  Services
          costs.  The  start date is inclusive, but the end date is exclusive.
          For example, if start is 2017-01-01 and end is 2017-05-01 , then the
          cost and usage data is retrieved from 2017-01-01 up to and including
          2017-04-30 but not including 2017-05-01 .

          Start -> (string)
              The beginning of the time period. The start date  is  inclusive.
              For  example,  if  start  is  2017-01-01  ,  Amazon Web Services
              retrieves cost and usage data starting at 2017-01-01 up  to  the
              end  date.  The start date must be equal to or no later than the
              current date to avoid a validation error.

          End -> (string)
              The end of the time period. The end date is exclusive. For exam-
              ple,  if  end is 2017-05-01 , Amazon Web Services retrieves cost
              and usage data from the start date up  to,  but  not  including,
              2017-05-01 .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Start=string,End=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Start": "string",
            "End": "string"
          }

       --granularity (string)
          Sets  the Amazon Web Services cost granularity to MONTHLY or DAILY ,
          or HOURLY . If Granularity isn't set, the  response  object  doesn't
          include the Granularity , either MONTHLY or DAILY , or HOURLY .

          Possible values:

          o DAILY

          o MONTHLY

          o HOURLY

       --filter (structure)
          Filters Amazon Web Services costs by different dimensions. For exam-
          ple, you can specify SERVICE and LINKED_ACCOUNT and  get  the  costs
          that  are  associated with that account's usage of that service. You
          can nest Expression objects to define any combination  of  dimension
          filters. For more information, see Expression .

          The  default values are EQUALS and CASE_SENSITIVE . Valid values for
          MatchOptions for Dimensions are EQUALS and CASE_SENSITIVE .

          Valid values for MatchOptions for CostCategories and Tags are EQUALS
          , ABSENT , and CASE_SENSITIVE .

          Or -> (list)
              Return results that match either Dimension object.

              (structure)
                 Use  Expression  to filter by cost or by usage. There are two
                 patterns:

                 o Simple dimension values - You can set  the  dimension  name
                   and  values for the filters that you plan to use. For exam-
                   ple,   you   can   filter    for    REGION==us-east-1    OR
                   REGION==us-west-1  . For GetRightsizingRecommendation , the
                   Region is a full name (for  example,  REGION==US  East  (N.
                   Virginia)  .  The  Expression  example  is  as  follows:  {
                   "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values":  [  "us-east-1",
                   us-west-1  ]  }  }    The list of dimension values are OR'd
                   together to retrieve cost or usage  data.  You  can  create
                   Expression  and  DimensionValues objects using either with*
                   methods or set* methods in multiple lines.

                 o Compound dimension values with logical operations - You can
                   use  multiple  Expression  types  and the logical operators
                   AND/OR/NOT to create a  list  of  one  or  more  Expression
                   objects.  By  doing  this,  you can filter on more advanced
                   options.  For  example,  you  can  filter  on  ((REGION  ==
                   us-east-1  OR  REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type == Type1))
                   AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer) . The Expression for  that
                   is as follows:  { "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key":
                   "REGION",  "Values":  [  "us-east-1",  "us-west-1"  ]   }},
                   {"Tags":  {  "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]},
                   {"Not": {"Dimensions":  {  "Key":  "USAGE_TYPE",  "Values":
                   ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }

                 NOTE:
                        Because  each  Expression  can have only one operator,
                        the service returns an error if more than one is spec-
                        ified.  The  following  example  shows  an  Expression
                        object that creates an error.

                     { "And":  [  ...  ],  "DimensionValues":  {  "Dimension":
                     "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

                 NOTE:
                     For  the  GetRightsizingRecommendation action, a combina-
                     tion of OR and NOT isn't supported.  OR  isn't  supported
                     between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT
                     operators aren't supported. Dimensions are  also  limited
                     to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

                     For the GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation action, only
                     NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions
                     are limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

                 Or -> (list)
                     Return results that match either Dimension object.

                     ( ... recursive ... )

                 And -> (list)
                     Return results that match both Dimension objects.

                        filter and group your results. For example, AZ returns
                        a list of Availability Zones.

                     Values -> (list)
                        The  metadata  values  that  you can use to filter and
                        group your results. You can use GetDimensionValues  to
                        find specific values.

                        results. MatchOptions is only applicable  for  actions
                        related  to  Cost  Category.  The  default  values for
                        MatchOptions are EQUALS and CASE_SENSITIVE .

       --metrics (list)
          Which  metrics are returned in the query. For more information about
          blended and unblended rates, see Why does the  "blended"  annotation
          appear on some line items in my bill? .

          Valid  values  are  AmortizedCost , BlendedCost , NetAmortizedCost ,
          NetUnblendedCost  ,  NormalizedUsageAmount  ,  UnblendedCost  ,  and
          UsageQuantity .

          NOTE:
                 If  you  return  the UsageQuantity metric, the service aggre-
                 gates all usage  numbers  without  taking  into  account  the
                 units. For example, if you aggregate usageQuantity across all
                 of Amazon EC2, the results aren't meaningful  because  Amazon
                 EC2 compute hours and data transfer are measured in different
                 units (for example, hours and GB).  To  get  more  meaningful
                 UsageQuantity metrics, filter by UsageType or UsageTypeGroups
                 .

              Metrics is required for GetCostAndUsage requests.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --group-by (list)
          You can group Amazon Web Services costs using up  to  two  different
          groups,  either  dimensions,  tag  keys, cost categories, or any two
          group by types.

          Valid values for  the  DIMENSION  type  are  AZ  ,  INSTANCE_TYPE  ,
          LEGAL_ENTITY_NAME  ,  LINKED_ACCOUNT  ,  OPERATION , PLATFORM , PUR-
          CHASE_TYPE , SERVICE , TENANCY , RECORD_TYPE , and USAGE_TYPE .

          When you group by the TAG type and include a valid tag key, you  get
          all tag values, including empty strings.

          (structure)
              Represents  a  group  when you specify a group by criteria or in
              the response to a query with a specific grouping.

              Type -> (string)
                 The string that represents the type of group.

              Key -> (string)
                 The string that represents a key for a specified group.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string,Key=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Type": "DIMENSION"|"TAG"|"COST_CATEGORY",
              "Key": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --next-page-token (string)
          The token to retrieve the next set of results. Amazon  Web  Services
          provides  the  token when the response from a previous call has more
          results than the maximum page size.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextPageToken -> (string)
          The  token  for the next set of retrievable results. Amazon Web Ser-
          vices provides the token when the response from a previous call  has
          more results than the maximum page size.

       GroupDefinitions -> (list)
          The groups that are specified by the Filter or GroupBy parameters in
          the request.

          (structure)
              Represents a group when you specify a group by  criteria  or  in
              the response to a query with a specific grouping.

              Type -> (string)
                 The string that represents the type of group.

              Key -> (string)
                 The string that represents a key for a specified group.

       ResultsByTime -> (list)
          The time period that's covered by the results in the response.

          (structure)
              The result that's associated with a time period.

              TimePeriod -> (structure)
                 The time period that the result covers.

                 Start -> (string)
                     The  beginning  of  the  time  period.  The start date is
                     inclusive. For example, if start is 2017-01-01  ,  Amazon
                     Web  Services  retrieves  cost and usage data starting at
                     2017-01-01 up to the end date. The  start  date  must  be
                     equal  to  or  no  later than the current date to avoid a
                     validation error.
