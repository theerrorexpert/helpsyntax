NAME
       get-rightsizing-recommendation -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates recommendations that help you save cost by identifying idle and
       underutilized Amazon EC2 instances.

       Recommendations  are  generated  to  either   downsize   or   terminate
       instances, along with providing savings detail and metrics. For details
       on calculation and function, see Optimizing Your Cost with  Rightsizing
       Recommendations in the Billing and Cost Management User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --filter (structure)
          Use  Expression  to  filter  by cost or by usage. There are two pat-
          terns:

          o Simple dimension values - You can set the dimension name and  val-
            ues  for  the  filters  that you plan to use. For example, you can
            filter for REGION==us-east-1 OR REGION==us-west-1 . For  GetRight-
            sizingRecommendation  ,  the  Region  is a full name (for example,
            REGION==US East (N. Virginia) . The Expression example is as  fol-
            lows:  { "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1",
            us-west-1 ] } }   The list of dimension values are  OR'd  together
            to  retrieve  cost  or  usage  data. You can create Expression and
            DimensionValues objects using either with* methods or set* methods
            in multiple lines.

          o Compound  dimension  values  with logical operations - You can use
            multiple Expression types and the logical operators AND/OR/NOT  to
            create  a  list  of one or more Expression objects. By doing this,
            you can filter on more advanced options. For example, you can fil-
            ter  on ((REGION == us-east-1 OR REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type
            == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer) . The  Expression  for
            that  is  as follows:  { "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key":
            "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ]  }},  {"Tags":  {
            "Key":  "TagName",  "Values":  ["Value1"] } } ]}, {"Not": {"Dimen-
            sions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }

          NOTE:
                 Because each Expression can have only one operator, the  ser-
                 vice returns an error if more than one is specified. The fol-
                 lowing example shows an Expression  object  that  creates  an
                 error.

              {   "And":   [   ...   ],   "DimensionValues":   {  "Dimension":
              "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

          NOTE:
              For the GetRightsizingRecommendation action, a combination of OR
              and  NOT  isn't  supported. OR isn't supported between different
              dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT  operators  aren't  sup-
              ported. Dimensions are also limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION ,
              or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

              For the GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation action, only NOT is
              supported.  AND  and OR aren't supported. Dimensions are limited
              to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

          Or -> (list)
              Return results that match either Dimension object.

              (structure)
                 Use Expression to filter by cost or by usage. There  are  two
                 patterns:

                 o Simple  dimension  values  - You can set the dimension name
                   and values for the filters that you plan to use. For  exam-
                   ple,    you    can    filter   for   REGION==us-east-1   OR
                   REGION==us-west-1 . For GetRightsizingRecommendation ,  the
                   Region  is  a  full  name (for example, REGION==US East (N.
                   Virginia) .  The  Expression  example  is  as  follows:   {
                   "Dimensions":  {  "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1",
                   us-west-1 ] } }   The list of  dimension  values  are  OR'd
                   together  to  retrieve  cost  or usage data. You can create
                   Expression and DimensionValues objects using  either  with*
                   methods or set* methods in multiple lines.

                 o Compound dimension values with logical operations - You can
                   use multiple Expression types  and  the  logical  operators
                   AND/OR/NOT  to  create  a  list  of  one or more Expression
                   objects. By doing this, you can  filter  on  more  advanced
                   options.  For  example,  you  can  filter  on  ((REGION  ==
                   us-east-1 OR REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type  ==  Type1))
                   AND  (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer) . The Expression for that
                   is as follows:  { "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key":
                   "REGION",   "Values":  [  "us-east-1",  "us-west-1"  ]  }},
                   {"Tags": { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] }  }  ]},
                   {"Not":  {"Dimensions":  {  "Key":  "USAGE_TYPE", "Values":
                   ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }

                 NOTE:
                        Because each Expression can have  only  one  operator,
                        the service returns an error if more than one is spec-
                        ified.  The  following  example  shows  an  Expression
                        object that creates an error.

                     {  "And":  [  ...  ],  "DimensionValues":  { "Dimension":
                     "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

                 NOTE:
                     For the GetRightsizingRecommendation action,  a  combina-
                     tion  of  OR  and NOT isn't supported. OR isn't supported
                     between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT
                     operators  aren't  supported. Dimensions are also limited
                     to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

                     For the GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation action, only
                     NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions
                     are limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

                 Or -> (list)
                     Return results that match either Dimension object.

                     ( ... recursive ... )

                 And -> (list)

              (structure)
                 Use  Expression  to filter by cost or by usage. There are two
                 patterns:

       --configuration (structure)
          Enables you to customize recommendations across two attributes.  You
          can  choose  to  view  recommendations for instances within the same
          instance families or across different  instance  families.  You  can
          also choose to view your estimated savings associated with recommen-
          dations with consideration of existing Savings Plans or RI benefits,
          or neither.

          RecommendationTarget -> (string)
              The  option to see recommendations within the same instance fam-
              ily or recommendations for instances across other families.  The
              default value is SAME_INSTANCE_FAMILY .

          BenefitsConsidered -> (boolean)
              The  option to consider RI or Savings Plans discount benefits in
              your savings calculation. The default value is TRUE .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RecommendationTarget=string,BenefitsConsidered=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "RecommendationTarget": "SAME_INSTANCE_FAMILY"|"CROSS_INSTANCE_FAMILY",
            "BenefitsConsidered": true|false
          }

       --service (string)
          The specific service that you want  recommendations  for.  The  only
          valid value for GetRightsizingRecommendation is "AmazonEC2 ".

       --page-size (integer)
          The  number  of  recommendations  that you want returned in a single
          response object.

       --next-page-token (string)
          The pagination token that indicates the next set of results that you
          want to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
