NAME
       list-cost-category-definitions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  name,  ARN, NumberOfRules and effective dates of all Cost
       Categories defined in the account. You have the option  to  use  Effec-
       tiveOn  to  return a list of Cost Categories that were active on a spe-
       cific date. If there is no EffectiveOn specified, youll see Cost  Cate-
       gories  that  are  effective  on  the current date. If Cost Category is
       still effective, EffectiveEnd is omitted in the response. ListCostCate-
       goryDefinitions  supports pagination. The request can have a MaxResults
       range up to 100.

SYNOPSIS
            list-cost-category-definitions
          [--effective-on <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --effective-on (string)
          The date when the Cost Category was effective.

       --next-token (string)
          The token to retrieve the next set of results. Amazon  Web  Services
          provides  the  token when the response from a previous call has more
          results than the maximum page size.

       --max-results (integer)
          The number of entries a paginated response contains.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
