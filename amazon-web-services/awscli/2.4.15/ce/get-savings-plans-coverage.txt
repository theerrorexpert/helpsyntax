NAME
       get-savings-plans-coverage -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the Savings Plans covered for your account. This enables you
       to see how much of your cost is covered by a Savings Plan. An organiza-
       tions  management account can see the coverage of the associated member
       accounts. This supports dimensions, Cost Categories, and nested expres-
       sions. For any time period, you can filter data for Savings Plans usage
       with the following dimensions:

       o LINKED_ACCOUNT

       o REGION

       o SERVICE

       o INSTANCE_FAMILY

       NOTE:
          GetSavingsPlansCoverage doesn't support filtering by  tags.  GetSav-
          ingsPlansCoverage  also doesn't support the OR operator between fil-
          ter dimensions. For the full request syntax with  supported  parame-
          ters, see Examples .

       To  determine  valid values for a dimension, use the GetDimensionValues
       operation.

            get-savings-plans-coverage
          --time-period <value>
          [--group-by <value>]
          [--granularity <value>]
          [--filter <value>]
          [--metrics <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--sort-by <value>]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --time-period (structure)
          The time period that you want the usage and  costs  for.  The  Start
          date  must be within 13 months. The End date must be after the Start
          date, and before the current date. Future dates can't be used as  an
          End date.

          Start -> (string)
              The  beginning  of the time period. The start date is inclusive.
              For example, if  start  is  2017-01-01  ,  Amazon  Web  Services
              retrieves  cost  and usage data starting at 2017-01-01 up to the
              end date. The start date must be equal to or no later  than  the
              current date to avoid a validation error.

          End -> (string)
              The end of the time period. The end date is exclusive. For exam-
              ple, if end is 2017-05-01 , Amazon Web Services  retrieves  cost
              and  usage  data  from  the start date up to, but not including,
              2017-05-01 .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Start=string,End=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Start": "string",
            "End": "string"
          }

       --group-by (list)
          You can group the data using the attributes INSTANCE_FAMILY , REGION
          , or SERVICE .

          (structure)
              Represents  a  group  when you specify a group by criteria or in
              the response to a query with a specific grouping.

              Type -> (string)
                 The string that represents the type of group.

              Key -> (string)
                 The string that represents a key for a specified group.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string,Key=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Type": "DIMENSION"|"TAG"|"COST_CATEGORY",
              "Key": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --granularity (string)
          The granularity of the Amazon Web Services cost data for  your  Sav-
          ings Plans. Granularity can't be set if GroupBy is set.

          The   GetSavingsPlansCoverage  operation  supports  only  DAILY  and
          MONTHLY granularities.

          Possible values:

          o DAILY

          o MONTHLY

          o HOURLY

       --filter (structure)
          Filters Savings Plans coverage data by dimensions.  You  can  filter
          data for Savings Plans usage with the following dimensions:

          o LINKED_ACCOUNT

          o REGION

          o SERVICE

          o INSTANCE_FAMILY
              GetSavingsPlansCoverage  uses  the same Expression object as the
              other operations, but only AND is supported  among  each  dimen-
              sion.

          Cost category is supported. Tags are not supported.

          Or -> (list)
              Return results that match either Dimension object.

              (structure)
                 Use  Expression  to filter by cost or by usage. There are two
                 patterns:

                 o Simple dimension values - You can set  the  dimension  name
                   and  values for the filters that you plan to use. For exam-
                   ple,   you   can   filter    for    REGION==us-east-1    OR
                   REGION==us-west-1  . For GetRightsizingRecommendation , the
                   Region is a full name (for  example,  REGION==US  East  (N.
                   Virginia)  .  The  Expression  example  is  as  follows:  {
                   "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values":  [  "us-east-1",
                   us-west-1  ]  }  }    The list of dimension values are OR'd
                   together to retrieve cost or usage  data.  You  can  create
                   Expression  and  DimensionValues objects using either with*
                   methods or set* methods in multiple lines.

                 o Compound dimension values with logical operations - You can
                   use  multiple  Expression  types  and the logical operators
                   AND/OR/NOT to create a  list  of  one  or  more  Expression
                   objects.  By  doing  this,  you can filter on more advanced
                   options.  For  example,  you  can  filter  on  ((REGION  ==
                   us-east-1  OR  REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type == Type1))
                   AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer) . The Expression for  that
                   is as follows:  { "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key":
                   "REGION",  "Values":  [  "us-east-1",  "us-west-1"  ]   }},
                   {"Tags":  {  "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]},
                   {"Not": {"Dimensions":  {  "Key":  "USAGE_TYPE",  "Values":
                   ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }

                 NOTE:
                        Because  each  Expression  can have only one operator,
                        the service returns an error if more than one is spec-
                        ified.  The  following  example  shows  an  Expression
                        object that creates an error.

                     { "And":  [  ...  ],  "DimensionValues":  {  "Dimension":
                     "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

                 NOTE:
                     For  the  GetRightsizingRecommendation action, a combina-
                     tion of OR and NOT isn't supported.  OR  isn't  supported
                     between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT
                     operators aren't supported. Dimensions are  also  limited
                     to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

                     For the GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation action, only
                     NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions
                     are limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

                 Or -> (list)
                     Return results that match either Dimension object.

                     ( ... recursive ... )

                 And -> (list)
                     Return results that match both Dimension objects.

                     ( ... recursive ... )

                        filter and group your results. For example, AZ returns
                        a list of Availability Zones.

                     Values -> (list)
                        The  metadata  values  that  you can use to filter and
                        group your results. You can use GetDimensionValues  to
                        find specific values.

                     MatchOptions -> (list)
                        The  match  options  that  you  can use to filter your
                        results. MatchOptions is only applicable  for  actions
                        related  to  Cost  Category.  The  default  values for
                        MatchOptions are EQUALS and CASE_SENSITIVE .

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --next-token (string)
          The token to retrieve the next set of results. Amazon  Web  Services
          provides  the  token when the response from a previous call has more
          results than the maximum page size.

       --max-results (integer)
          The number of items to be returned in a response. The default is  20
          , with a minimum value of 1 .

       --sort-by (structure)
          The value by which you want to sort the data.

          The following values are supported for Key :

          o SpendCoveredBySavingsPlan

          o OnDemandCost

          o CoveragePercentage

          o TotalCost

          o InstanceFamily

          o Region

          o Service

          Supported values for SortOrder are ASCENDING or DESCENDING .

          Key -> (string)
              The key that's used to sort the data.

          SortOrder -> (string)
              The order that's used to sort the data.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,SortOrder=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Key": "string",
            "SortOrder": "ASCENDING"|"DESCENDING"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     retrieves cost and usage data from the start date up  to,
                     but not including, 2017-05-01 .

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token  to retrieve the next set of results. Amazon Web Services
          provides the token when the response from a previous call  has  more
          results than the maximum page size.
