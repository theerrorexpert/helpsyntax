SYNOPSIS
            get-anomalies
          [--monitor-arn <value>]
          --date-interval <value>
          [--feedback <value>]
          [--total-impact <value>]
          [--next-page-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --monitor-arn (string)
          Retrieves all of the cost anomalies detected  for  a  specific  cost
          anomaly monitor Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

       --date-interval (structure)
          Assigns  the  start and end dates for retrieving cost anomalies. The
          returned anomaly object will have an AnomalyEndDate in the specified
          time range.

          StartDate -> (string)
              The first date an anomaly was observed.

          EndDate -> (string)
              The last date an anomaly was observed.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          StartDate=string,EndDate=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "StartDate": "string",
            "EndDate": "string"
          }

       --feedback (string)
          Filters anomaly results by the feedback field on the anomaly object.

          Possible values:

          o YES

          o NO

          o PLANNED_ACTIVITY

       --total-impact (structure)
          Filters anomaly results by the total impact  field  on  the  anomaly
          object. For example, you can filter anomalies GREATER_THAN 200.00 to
          retrieve anomalies, with an estimated  dollar  impact  greater  than
          200.

          NumericOperator -> (string)
              The comparing value that's used in the filter.

          StartValue -> (double)
              The lower bound dollar value that's used in the filter.

          EndValue -> (double)
              The upper bound dollar value that's used in the filter.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          NumericOperator=string,StartValue=double,EndValue=double

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "NumericOperator": "EQUAL"|"GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL"|"LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL"|"GREATER_THAN"|"LESS_THAN"|"BETWEEN",
            "StartValue": double,
            "EndValue": double
          }

       --next-page-token (string)
          The  token  to retrieve the next set of results. Amazon Web Services
          provides the token when the response from a previous call  has  more
          results than the maximum page size.

       --max-results (integer)
          The number of entries a paginated response contains.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
