GET-MEDIA()                                                        GET-MEDIA()



NAME
       get-media -

DESCRIPTION
       Use  this API to retrieve media content from a Kinesis video stream. In
       the request, you identify the stream name  or  stream  Amazon  Resource
       Name  (ARN), and the starting chunk. Kinesis Video Streams then returns
       a stream of chunks in order by fragment number.

       NOTE:
          You must first call the GetDataEndpoint API to get an endpoint. Then
          send the GetMedia requests to this endpoint using the --endpoint-url
          parameter .

       When you put media data (fragments) on a stream, Kinesis Video  Streams
       stores  each incoming fragment and related metadata in what is called a
       "chunk." For more information, see PutMedia . The GetMedia API  returns
       a  stream  of  these chunks starting from the chunk that you specify in
       the request.

       The following limits apply when using the GetMedia API:

       o A client can call GetMedia up to five times per second per stream.

       o Kinesis Video Streams sends  media  data  at  a  rate  of  up  to  25
         megabytes  per  second (or 200 megabits per second) during a GetMedia
         session.

       NOTE:
          If an error is thrown after invoking a Kinesis Video  Streams  media
          API,  in  addition to the HTTP status code and the response body, it
          includes the following pieces of information:

          o x-amz-ErrorType HTTP header  contains a more specific  error  type
            in addition to what the HTTP status code provides.

          o x-amz-RequestId  HTTP  header   if  you want to report an issue to
            AWS, the support team can better diagnose the problem if given the
            Request Id.

          Both  the  HTTP status code and the ErrorType header can be utilized
          to make programmatic decisions about whether errors  are  retry-able
          and  under  what  conditions, as well as provide information on what
          actions the client programmer might need to take in  order  to  suc-
          cessfully try again.

          For  more  information, see the Errors section at the bottom of this
          topic, as well as Common Errors .

SYNOPSIS
            get-media
          [--stream-name <value>]
          [--stream-arn <value>]
          --start-selector <value>
          <outfile>

OPTIONS
       --stream-name (string)
          The Kinesis video stream name from where you want to get  the  media
          content.  If you don't specify the streamName , you must specify the
          streamARN .

       --stream-arn (string)
          The ARN of the stream from where you want to get the media  content.
          If you don't specify the streamARN , you must specify the streamName
          .

       --start-selector (structure)
          Identifies the starting chunk to get from the specified stream.

          StartSelectorType -> (string)
              Identifies the fragment on the Kinesis video  stream  where  you
              want to start getting the data from.

              o NOW - Start with the latest chunk on the stream.

              o EARLIEST  - Start with earliest available chunk on the stream.

              o FRAGMENT_NUMBER - Start with the chunk after a specific  frag-
                ment. You must also specify the AfterFragmentNumber parameter.

              o PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP or SERVER_TIMESTAMP - Start with the  chunk
                containing  a  fragment  with the specified producer or server
                timestamp. You specify the timestamp by adding  StartTimestamp
                .

              o CONTINUATION_TOKEN  -  Read  using  the specified continuation
                token.

              NOTE:
                 If you choose the NOW, EARLIEST, or CONTINUATION_TOKEN as the
                 startSelectorType , you don't provide any additional informa-
                 tion in the startSelector .

          AfterFragmentNumber -> (string)
              Specifies the fragment number from where you want  the  GetMedia
              API to start returning the fragments.

          StartTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp value. This value is required if you choose the PRO-
              DUCER_TIMESTAMP or the SERVER_TIMESTAMP as the startSelectorType
              .  The  GetMedia  API  then starts with the chunk containing the
              fragment that has the specified timestamp.

          ContinuationToken -> (string)
              Continuation token that Kinesis Video Streams  returned  in  the
              previous  GetMedia  response.  The GetMedia API then starts with
              the chunk identified by the continuation token.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          StartSelectorType=string,AfterFragmentNumber=string,StartTimestamp=timestamp,ContinuationToken=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "StartSelectorType": "FRAGMENT_NUMBER"|"SERVER_TIMESTAMP"|"PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP"|"NOW"|"EARLIEST"|"CONTINUATION_TOKEN",
            "AfterFragmentNumber": "string",
            "StartTimestamp": timestamp,
            "ContinuationToken": "string"
          }

       outfile (string) Filename where the content will be saved

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ContentType -> (string)
          The content type of the requested media.

       Payload -> (blob)
          The payload Kinesis Video Streams returns is a  sequence  of  chunks
          from  the  specified stream. For information about the chunks, see .
          The chunks that Kinesis Video Streams returns in the  GetMedia  call
          also include the following additional Matroska (MKV) tags:

          o AWS_KINESISVIDEO_CONTINUATION_TOKEN  (UTF-8 string) - In the event
            your GetMedia call terminates, you can use this continuation token
            in  your next request to get the next chunk where the last request
            terminated.

          o AWS_KINESISVIDEO_MILLIS_BEHIND_NOW (UTF-8 string) - Client  appli-
            cations  can  use  this  tag value to determine how far behind the
            chunk returned in the response is from the  latest  chunk  on  the
            stream.

          o AWS_KINESISVIDEO_FRAGMENT_NUMBER - Fragment number returned in the
            chunk.

          o AWS_KINESISVIDEO_SERVER_TIMESTAMP - Server timestamp of the  frag-
            ment.

          o AWS_KINESISVIDEO_PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP  -  Producer  timestamp of the
            fragment.

          The following tags will be present if an error occurs:

          o AWS_KINESISVIDEO_ERROR_CODE - String description of an error  that
            caused GetMedia to stop.

          o AWS_KINESISVIDEO_ERROR_ID: Integer code of the error.

          The error codes are as follows:

          o 3002 - Error writing to the stream

          o 4000 - Requested fragment is not found

          o 4500 - Access denied for the stream's KMS key

          o 4501 - Stream's KMS key is disabled

          o 4502 - Validation error on the stream's KMS key

          o 4503 - KMS key specified in the stream is unavailable

          o 4504 - Invalid usage of the KMS key specified in the stream

          o 4505 - Invalid state of the KMS key specified in the stream

          o 4506 - Unable to find the KMS key specified in the stream

          o 5000 - Internal error



                                                                   GET-MEDIA()
