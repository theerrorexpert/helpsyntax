DESCRIPTION
       Welcome to the Amazon AppFlow API reference. This guide is for develop-
       ers who need detailed information about the Amazon AppFlow  API  opera-
       tions, data types, and errors.

       Amazon  AppFlow is a fully managed integration service that enables you
       to securely transfer data between software as a service (SaaS) applica-
       tions  like  Salesforce, Marketo, Slack, and ServiceNow, and Amazon Web
       Services like Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift.

       If you're new to Amazon AppFlow,  we  recommend  that  you  review  the
       Amazon AppFlow User Guide .

       Amazon  AppFlow API users can use vendor-specific mechanisms for OAuth,
       and include applicable OAuth attributes (such as auth-code and redirec-
       turi ) with the connector-specific ConnectorProfileProperties when cre-
       ating a new connector profile using Amazon AppFlow API operations.  For
       example,  Salesforce users can refer to the ` Authorize Apps with OAuth
       https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=remoteaccess_authenticate.htm`__
       documentation.
