NAME
       create-token -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  and  returns  an  access  token for the authorized client. The
       access token issued will be used to fetch  short-term  credentials  for
       the assigned roles in the AWS account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-token
          --client-id <value>
          --client-secret <value>
          --grant-type <value>
          --device-code <value>
          [--code <value>]
          [--refresh-token <value>]
          [--scope <value>]
          [--redirect-uri <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-id (string)
          The unique identifier string for each client. This value should come
          from the persisted result of the  RegisterClient API.

       --client-secret (string)
          A secret string generated for the client.  This  value  should  come
          from the persisted result of the  RegisterClient API.

       --grant-type (string)
          Supports  grant  types  for  authorization  code, refresh token, and
          device code request.

       --device-code (string)
          Used only when calling this API for the device code grant type. This
          short-term  code  is  used  to identify this authentication attempt.
          This should come from an in-memory reference to the  result  of  the
          StartDeviceAuthorization API.

       --code (string)
          The authorization code received from the authorization service. This
          parameter is required to perform an authorization grant  request  to
          get access to a token.

       --refresh-token (string)
          The  token  used  to  obtain  an  access token in the event that the
          access token is invalid or expired. This token is not issued by  the
          service.

       --scope (list)
          The  list  of  scopes that is defined by the client. Upon authoriza-
          tion, this list is used to restrict  permissions  when  granting  an
          access token.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --redirect-uri (string)
          The  location of the application that will receive the authorization
          code. Users authorize the service to send the request to this  loca-
          tion.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       accessToken -> (string)
          An opaque token to access AWS SSO resources assigned to a user.

       tokenType -> (string)
          Used  to  notify  the  client  that  the returned token is an access
          token. The supported type is BearerToken .

       expiresIn -> (integer)
          Indicates the time in seconds when an access token will expire.

       refreshToken -> (string)
          A token that, if present, can be used to refresh a previously issued
          access token that might have expired.
