REGISTER-CLIENT()                                            REGISTER-CLIENT()



NAME
       register-client -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers a client with AWS SSO. This allows clients to initiate device
       authorization. The output should be persisted for  reuse  through  many
       authentication requests.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            register-client
          --client-name <value>
          --client-type <value>
          [--scopes <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-name (string)
          The friendly name of the client.

       --client-type (string)
          The  type  of  client.  The service supports only public as a client
          type. Anything other than public will be rejected by the service.

       --scopes (list)
          The list of scopes that are defined by the client.  Upon  authoriza-
          tion,  this  list  is  used to restrict permissions when granting an
          access token.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       clientId -> (string)
          The unique identifier string for each client. This client uses  this
          identifier  to get authenticated by the service in subsequent calls.

       clientSecret -> (string)
          A secret string generated for the client. The client will  use  this
          string to get authenticated by the service in subsequent calls.

       clientIdIssuedAt -> (long)
          Indicates  the  time  at  which  the  clientId and clientSecret were
          issued.

       clientSecretExpiresAt -> (long)
          Indicates the time at  which  the  clientId  and  clientSecret  will
          become invalid.

       authorizationEndpoint -> (string)
          The endpoint where the client can request authorization.

       tokenEndpoint -> (string)
          The endpoint where the client can get an access token.
