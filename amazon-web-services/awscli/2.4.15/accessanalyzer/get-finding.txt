GET-FINDING()                                                    GET-FINDING()



NAME
       get-finding -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information about the specified finding.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-finding
          --analyzer-arn <value>
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --analyzer-arn (string)
          The ARN of the analyzer that generated the finding.

       --id (string)
          The ID of the finding to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              public access to the resource.

          principal -> (map)
              The external principal that access to a resource within the zone

              The type of the resource identified in the finding.

          sources -> (list)
              The  sources  of the finding. This indicates how the access that
              generated the finding is granted. It is populated for Amazon  S3
              bucket findings.

              (structure)
                 The source of the finding. This indicates how the access that
                 generated the finding is granted. It is populated for  Amazon
                 S3 bucket findings.

                 detail -> (structure)
                     Includes  details about how the access that generated the
