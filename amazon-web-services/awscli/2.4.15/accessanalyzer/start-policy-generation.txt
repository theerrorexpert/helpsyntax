NAME
       start-policy-generation -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts the policy generation request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-policy-generation
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--cloud-trail-details <value>]
          --policy-generation-details <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. Idempotency ensures that an API  request
          completes  only  once.  With  an idempotent request, if the original
          request completes successfully, the subsequent retries with the same
          client  token return the result from the original successful request
          and they have no additional effect.

          If you do not specify a client token, one is automatically generated
          by the Amazon Web Services SDK.

       --cloud-trail-details (structure)
          A  CloudTrailDetails object that contains details about a Trail that
          you want to analyze to generate policies.

          accessRole -> (string)
              The ARN of the service role that IAM  Access  Analyzer  uses  to
              access  your CloudTrail trail and service last accessed informa-
              tion.

          endTime -> (timestamp)
              The end of the time range for which IAM Access Analyzer  reviews
              your  CloudTrail events. Events with a timestamp after this time
              are not considered to generate a policy. If this is not included
              in the request, the default value is the current time.

          startTime -> (timestamp)
              The  start  of  the  time  range  for  which IAM Access Analyzer
              reviews your CloudTrail events. Events with a  timestamp  before
              this time are not considered to generate a policy.

          trails -> (list)
              A Trail object that contains settings for a trail.

              (structure)
                 Contains details about the CloudTrail trail being analyzed to
                 generate a policy.

                 allRegions -> (boolean)
                     Possible values are true or false . If set to true ,  IAM
                     Access   Analyzer  retrieves  CloudTrail  data  from  all
                     regions to analyze and generate a policy.

                 cloudTrailArn -> (string)
                     Specifies the ARN of the trail. The format of a trail ARN
                     is                                         arn:aws:cloud-
                     trail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail .

                 regions -> (list)
                     A list of regions to get CloudTrail data from and analyze
                     to generate a policy.

                     (string)

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "accessRole": "string",
            "endTime": timestamp,
            "startTime": timestamp,
            "trails": [
              {
                "allRegions": true|false,
                "cloudTrailArn": "string",
                "regions": ["string", ...]
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --policy-generation-details (structure)
          Contains  the ARN of the IAM entity (user or role) for which you are
          generating a policy.

          principalArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the IAM entity (user or role) for which you are  gen-
              erating a policy.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          principalArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "principalArn": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       jobId -> (string)
          The  JobId  that is returned by the StartPolicyGeneration operation.
          The JobId can be used with GetGeneratedPolicy to retrieve the gener-
          ated policies or used with CancelPolicyGeneration to cancel the pol-
          icy generation request.
