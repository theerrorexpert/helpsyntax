NAME
       get-access-preview -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information  about  an access preview for the specified ana-
       lyzer.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-access-preview
          --access-preview-id <value>
          --analyzer-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --access-preview-id (string)
          The unique ID for the access preview.

       --analyzer-arn (string)
          The ARN of the analyzer used to generate the access preview.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       accessPreview -> (structure)
          An object that contains information about the access preview.

          analyzerArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the analyzer used to generate the access preview.

          configurations -> (map)
              A map of resource ARNs for the proposed resource  configuration.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                 Access  control  configuration  structures for your resource.
                 You specify the configuration as a type-value pair.  You  can
                 specify only one type of access control configuration.

                 iamRole -> (structure)
                     The access control configuration is for an IAM role.

                     trustPolicy -> (string)
                        The proposed trust policy for the IAM role.

                 kmsKey -> (structure)
                     The access control configuration is for a KMS key.

                     grants -> (list)
                        A  list  of  proposed grant configurations for the KMS
                        key. If the proposed grant  configuration  is  for  an
                        existing  key,  the  access  preview uses the proposed
                        list of grant configurations in place of the  existing
                        grants.  Otherwise, the access preview uses the exist-
                        ing grants for the key.

                        (structure)
                            A proposed grant configuration for a KMS key.  For
                            more information, see CreateGrant .

                            constraints -> (structure)
                               Use   this   structure   to   propose  allowing
                               cryptographic operations in the grant only when
                               the  operation  request  includes the specified
                               encryption context .

                               encryptionContextEquals -> (map)

                                   the encryption context in the cryptographic
                                   operation request.  The  grant  allows  the
                                   operation  only when the encryption context
                                   in the request is the same as  the  encryp-
                                   tion  context specified in this constraint.

                               encryptionContextSubset -> (map)
                                   A list of  key-value  pairs  that  must  be
                                   included  in  the encryption context of the
                                   cryptographic operation request. The  grant
                                   allows  the  cryptographic  operation  only
                                   when the encryption context in the  request
                                   includes  the  key-value pairs specified in
                                   this constraint, although  it  can  include
                                   additional key-value pairs.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (structure)
                            The configuration for an Amazon S3 access point or
                            multi-region access point for the bucket. You  can
                            propose  up  to  10  access points or multi-region
                            access points per bucket. If the  proposed  Amazon
                            S3  access  point configuration is for an existing
                            bucket,  the  access  preview  uses  the  proposed

                            ing access points.  To  propose  an  access  point
                            without  a policy, you can provide an empty string
                            as the access point policy. For more  information,
                            see  Creating access points . For more information
                            about  access  point  policy  limits,  see  Access
                            points restrictions and limitations .

                               Configuration does not  apply  to  multi-region
                               access  points.  If the access preview is for a
                               new resource  and  neither  is  specified,  the
                               access  preview  uses  Internet for the network
                               origin. If the access preview is for an  exist-
                               ing  resource  and  neither  is  specified, the
                               access preview uses the exiting network origin.

                                   configuration  for  the  Amazon  S3  access
                                   point.  VPC configuration does not apply to
                                   multi-region access points. For more infor-
                                   mation, see VpcConfiguration .

                                   vpcId -> (string)

                        bucket. If the proposed grant configuration is for  an
                        existing  bucket, the access preview uses the proposed
                        list of grant configurations in place of the  existing
                        grants.  Otherwise, the access preview uses the exist-

              For example, if the creation of  the  access  preview  fails,  a
              Failed  status is returned. This failure can be due to an inter-
              nal issue with the analysis or due to an invalid  resource  con-
              figuration.

              code -> (string)
                 The reason code for the current status of the access preview.
