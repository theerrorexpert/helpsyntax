NAME
       create-access-preview -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  access  preview that allows you to preview IAM Access Ana-
       lyzer findings for your resource before deploying resource permissions.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-access-preview
          --analyzer-arn <value>
          [--client-token <value>]
          --configurations <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --analyzer-arn (string)
          The ARN of the account analyzer used to generate the access preview.
          You can only create an access preview for analyzers with an  Account
          type and Active status.

       --client-token (string)
          A client token.

       --configurations (map)
          Access  control configuration for your resource that is used to gen-
          erate the access preview. The access preview includes  findings  for
          external  access  allowed  to  the resource with the proposed access
          control configuration. The configuration must  contain  exactly  one
          element.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Access  control  configuration structures for your resource. You
              specify the configuration as a type-value pair. You can  specify
              only one type of access control configuration.

              iamRole -> (structure)
                 The access control configuration is for an IAM role.

                 trustPolicy -> (string)
                     The proposed trust policy for the IAM role.

              kmsKey -> (structure)
                 The access control configuration is for a KMS key.

                 grants -> (list)
                     A  list of proposed grant configurations for the KMS key.
                     If the proposed grant configuration is  for  an  existing
                     key,  the  access preview uses the proposed list of grant
                     configurations in place of the  existing  grants.  Other-
                     wise, the access preview uses the existing grants for the
                     key.

                     (structure)
                        A proposed grant configuration for a KMS key. For more
                        information, see CreateGrant .

                        constraints -> (structure)
                            Use    this    structure   to   propose   allowing
                            cryptographic operations in the  grant  only  when
                            the   operation  request  includes  the  specified
                            encryption context .

                            encryptionContextEquals -> (map)
                               A list of key-value pairs that must  match  the
                               encryption  context in the cryptographic opera-
                               tion request. The grant  allows  the  operation
                               only when the encryption context in the request
                               is the same as the encryption context specified
                               in this constraint.

                               key -> (string)

                               in the encryption context of the  cryptographic
                               operation request. The grant allows the crypto-
                               graphic operation only when the encryption con-
                               text  in  the  request  includes  the key-value
                               pairs specified in this constraint, although it
                               can include additional key-value pairs.

                               key -> (string)

                            KMS grants issued by accounts other than the owner
                            of the key.

                        operations -> (list)
                            A list of operations that the grant permits.

                            (string)

                        retiringPrincipal -> (string)
                            The  principal  that is given permission to retire
                            the grant by using RetireGrant operation.

                 keyPolicies -> (map)

                     valid  value  for the name of the key policy is default .
                     For more information, see Default key policy .

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

              s3Bucket -> (structure)
                 The access control configuration is for an Amazon S3  Bucket.

                 accessPoints -> (map)
                     The   configuration   of   Amazon  S3  access  points  or
                     multi-region access points for the bucket. You  can  pro-
                     pose up to 10 new access points per bucket.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        The  configuration  for  an  Amazon S3 access point or
                        multi-region access point for the bucket. You can pro-
                        pose  up  to  10  access points or multi-region access
                        points per bucket. If the proposed  Amazon  S3  access
                        point  configuration  is  for  an existing bucket, the
                        access preview uses the proposed access point configu-
                        ration in place of the existing access points. To pro-
                        pose an access point without a policy, you can provide
                        an  empty  string as the access point policy. For more
                        information, see Creating access  points  .  For  more
                        information  about  access  point  policy  limits, see

                            apply to this Amazon S3 access point.  VpcConfigu-
                            ration  does  not  apply  to  multi-region  access
                            points.  If  the  access  preview  is  for  a  new
                            resource and neither is specified, the access pre-
                            view uses Internet for the network origin. If  the
                            access  preview  is  for  an existing resource and
                            neither is specified, the access preview uses  the
                            exiting network origin.

                               figuration for the Amazon S3 access point.  VPC
                               configuration  does  not  apply to multi-region
                               access  points.  For  more   information,   see
                               VpcConfiguration .

                                   If  this  field  is  specified, this access
                                   point will only allow connections from  the
                                   specified VPC ID.

                            apply  to  this  Amazon   S3   access   point   or
                            multi-region access point.

                            ignorePublicAcls -> (boolean)
                               Specifies  whether Amazon S3 should ignore pub-
                               lic ACLs for this bucket and  objects  in  this
                               bucket.

                     proposed grant configuration is for an  existing  bucket,
                     the  access  preview uses the proposed list of grant con-
                     figurations in place of the existing  grants.  Otherwise,
                     the  access  preview  uses  the  existing  grants for the
                     bucket.

       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
