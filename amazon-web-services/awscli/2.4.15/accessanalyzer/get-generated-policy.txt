DESCRIPTION

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-generated-policy
          [--include-resource-placeholders | --no-include-resource-placeholders]
          [--include-service-level-template | --no-include-service-level-template]
          --job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --include-resource-placeholders   |  --no-include-resource-placeholders
       (boolean)
          The level of detail that you  want  to  generate.  You  can  specify
          whether to generate policies with placeholders for resource ARNs for
          actions that support resource level granularity in policies.

          For example, in the resource section of a policy, you can receive  a
          placeholder  such as "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::${BucketName}" instead
          of "*" .

       --include-service-level-template |  --no-include-service-level-template
       (boolean)
          The  level  of  detail  that  you  want to generate. You can specify
          whether to generate service-level policies.

          IAM Access Analyzer uses iam:servicelastaccessed  to  identify  ser-
          vices that have been used recently to create this service-level tem-
          plate.

       --job-id (string)
          The JobId that is returned by the  StartPolicyGeneration  operation.
          The JobId can be used with GetGeneratedPolicy to retrieve the gener-
          ated policies or used with CancelPolicyGeneration to cancel the pol-
          icy generation request.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       generatedPolicyResult -> (structure)
          A  GeneratedPolicyResult object that contains the generated policies
          and associated details.

          generatedPolicies -> (list)
              The text to use as the content for the new policy. The policy is
              created using the CreatePolicy action.

              (structure)
                 Contains the text for the generated policy.

                 policy -> (string)
                     The  text  to  use as the content for the new policy. The
                     policy is created using the CreatePolicy action.

          properties -> (structure)
              A GeneratedPolicyProperties object that contains  properties  of
              the generated policy.

              cloudTrailProperties -> (structure)
                 Lists details about the Trail used to generated policy.

                 endTime -> (timestamp)
                     The  end  of the time range for which IAM Access Analyzer
                     reviews your CloudTrail events. Events with  a  timestamp
                     after  this time are not considered to generate a policy.
                     If this is not included in the request, the default value
                     is the current time.

                 startTime -> (timestamp)
                     The start of the time range for which IAM Access Analyzer
                     reviews your CloudTrail events. Events with  a  timestamp
                     before this time are not considered to generate a policy.

                 trailProperties -> (list)
                     A TrailProperties object that contains settings for trail
                     properties.

                     (structure)
                        Contains details about the CloudTrail trail being ana-
                        lyzed to generate a policy.

                        allRegions -> (boolean)
                            Possible values are true or false . If set to true
                            ,  IAM  Access  Analyzer retrieves CloudTrail data
                            from all regions to analyze and generate a policy.

                        cloudTrailArn -> (string)
                            Specifies  the  ARN  of the trail. The format of a
                            trail        ARN         is         arn:aws:cloud-
                            trail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail .

                        regions -> (list)

                            (string)

              isComplete -> (boolean)
                 This value is set to true if the  generated  policy  contains
                 all  possible  actions for a service that IAM Access Analyzer
                 identified from the CloudTrail trail that you specified,  and
                 false otherwise.

              principalArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of  the IAM entity (user or role) for which you are
                 generating a policy.

       jobDetails -> (structure)
          A GeneratedPolicyDetails object that contains details about the gen-
          erated policy.

                 vice quota was exceeded or which resource was not found.

          jobId -> (string)
              The JobId that is returned by the  StartPolicyGeneration  opera-
              tion.  The JobId can be used with GetGeneratedPolicy to retrieve
              the generated policies or used  with  CancelPolicyGeneration  to
              cancel the policy generation request.

          startedOn -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp of when the job was started.
