LIST-ACCESS-PREVIEW-FINDINGS()                  LIST-ACCESS-PREVIEW-FINDINGS()



NAME
       list-access-preview-findings -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a list of access preview findings generated by the specified
       access preview.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-access-preview-findings is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: findings

SYNOPSIS

          --access-preview-id <value>
          --analyzer-arn <value>
          [--filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]

OPTIONS
       --access-preview-id (string)
          The unique ID for the access preview.

       --analyzer-arn (string)
          The ARN of the analyzer used to generate the access.

       --filter (map)
          Criteria to filter the returned findings.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              The criteria to use in the filter that defines the archive rule.

              contains -> (list)
                 A "contains" operator to match for the filter used to  create
                 the rule.

                 (string)

              eq -> (list)
                 An  "equals"  operator to match for the filter used to create
                 the rule.

                 (string)

              exists -> (boolean)
                 An "exists" operator to match for the filter used  to  create
                 the rule.

              neq -> (list)
                 A  "not equals" operator to match for the filter used to cre-
                 ate the rule.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=contains=string,string,eq=string,string,exists=boolean,neq=string,string,KeyName2=contains=string,string,eq=string,string,exists=boolean,neq=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": {
                "contains": ["string", ...],
                "eq": ["string", ...],
                "exists": true|false,
                "neq": ["string", ...]
              }
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       findings -> (list)
          A  list  of  access preview findings that match the specified filter
          criteria.

          (structure)
              An access preview finding generated by the access preview.

              action -> (list)
                 The action in the analyzed policy statement that an  external
                 principal has permission to perform.

                 (string)

              changeType -> (string)
                 Provides  context  on how the access preview finding compares
                 to existing access identified in IAM Access Analyzer.

                 o New - The finding is for newly-introduced access.

                 o Unchanged - The preview finding is an existing finding that
                   would remain unchanged.

                 o Changed - The preview finding is an existing finding with a
                   change in status.

                 For example, a Changed finding with preview  status  Resolved
                 and  existing  status  Active  indicates  the existing Active
                 finding would become Resolved as a  result  of  the  proposed
                 permissions change.

              condition -> (map)
                 The  condition in the analyzed policy statement that resulted
                 in a finding.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the access preview finding was created.

              error -> (string)
                 An error.

              existingFindingId -> (string)
                 The existing ID of the finding in IAM Access  Analyzer,  pro-
                 vided only for existing findings.

              existingFindingStatus -> (string)
                 The  existing status of the finding, provided only for exist-
                 ing findings.

              id -> (string)
                 The ID of the access preview finding. This ID uniquely  iden-
                 tifies the element in the list of access preview findings and
                 is not related to the finding ID in Access Analyzer.

              isPublic -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether  the  policy  that  generated  the  finding
                 allows public access to the resource.

              principal -> (map)
                 The  external  principal that has access to a resource within
                 the zone of trust.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              resource -> (string)
                 The resource that an external principal has access  to.  This
                 is the resource associated with the access preview.

              resourceOwnerAccount -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web  Services account ID that owns the resource.
                 For most Amazon Web Services resources, the owning account is
                 the account in which the resource was created.

              resourceType -> (string)
                 The type of the resource that can be accessed in the finding.

              sources -> (list)
                 The sources of the finding. This  indicates  how  the  access
                 that  generated  the  finding is granted. It is populated for
                 Amazon S3 bucket findings.

                 (structure)
                     The source of the finding. This indicates how the  access
                     that  generated  the  finding is granted. It is populated
                     for Amazon S3 bucket findings.

                     detail -> (structure)
                        Includes details about how the access  that  generated
                        the  finding  is granted. This is populated for Amazon
                        S3 bucket findings.

                        accessPointArn -> (string)
                            The ARN of the access  point  that  generated  the
                            finding. The ARN format depends on whether the ARN
                            represents  an  access  point  or  a  multi-region
                            access point.

                     type -> (string)
                        Indicates  the type of access that generated the find-
                        ing.

              status -> (string)
                 The preview status of the finding. This is what the status of
                 the  finding would be after permissions deployment. For exam-
                 ple, a Changed  finding  with  preview  status  Resolved  and
                 existing  status Active indicates the existing Active finding
                 would become Resolved as a result of the proposed permissions
                 change.

       nextToken -> (string)
          A token used for pagination of results returned.
