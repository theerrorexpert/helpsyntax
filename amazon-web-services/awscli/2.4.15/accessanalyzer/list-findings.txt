LIST-FINDINGS()                                                LIST-FINDINGS()



NAME
       list-findings -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a list of findings generated by the specified analyzer.

       To learn about filter keys that you can use to retrieve a list of find-
       ings, see IAM Access Analyzer filter keys in the IAM User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-findings is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: findings

OPTIONS
       --analyzer-arn (string)
          The ARN of the analyzer to retrieve findings from.

       --filter (map)
          A filter to match for the findings to return.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              The criteria to use in the filter that defines the archive rule.

              contains -> (list)
                 A "contains" operator to match for the filter used to  create
                 the rule.

                 (string)

              eq -> (list)
                 An  "equals"  operator to match for the filter used to create
                 the rule.

                 (string)

              exists -> (boolean)
                 An "exists" operator to match for the filter used  to  create
                 the rule.

              neq -> (list)
                 A  "not equals" operator to match for the filter used to cre-
                 ate the rule.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=contains=string,string,eq=string,string,exists=boolean,neq=string,string,KeyName2=contains=string,string,eq=string,string,exists=boolean,neq=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": {
                "contains": ["string", ...],
                "eq": ["string", ...],
                "exists": true|false,
                "neq": ["string", ...]
              }
            ...}

       --sort (structure)
          The sort order for the findings returned.

          attributeName -> (string)
              The name of the attribute to sort on.

          orderBy -> (string)
              The sort order, ascending or descending.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attributeName=string,orderBy=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "attributeName": "string",
            "orderBy": "ASC"|"DESC"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
