NAME
       evidently -

DESCRIPTION
       You can use Amazon CloudWatch Evidently to safely validate new features
       by serving them to a specified percentage of your users while you  roll
       out  the feature. You can monitor the performance of the new feature to
       help you decide when to ramp up traffic to your users. This  helps  you
       reduce  risk  and  identify  unintended  consequences  before you fully
       launch the feature.

       You can also conduct A/B experiments to make feature  design  decisions
       based  on  evidence  and  data.  An experiment can test as many as five
       variations at once. Evidently collects experiment data and analyzes  it
       using statistical methods. It also provides clear recommendations about
       which variations perform better. You can test both user-facing features
       and backend features.
