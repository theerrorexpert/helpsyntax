NAME
       get-architecture-recommendations -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets   recommendations   about   architecture   designs  for  improving
       resiliency for an application, based on a recovery group.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-architecture-recommendations
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          --recovery-group-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          The number of objects that you want to return with this call.

       --next-token (string)
          The token that identifies which batch of results you want to see.

       --recovery-group-name (string)
          The name of a recovery group.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LastAuditTimestamp -> (timestamp)
          The time that a recovery group was  last  assessed  for  recommenda-
          tions, in UTC ISO-8601 format.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token that identifies which batch of results you want to see.

       Recommendations -> (list)
          A list of the recommendations for the customer's application.

          (structure)
              Recommendations  that  are  provided to make an application more
              recovery resilient.

              RecommendationText -> (string)
                 Text of the recommendations that  are  provided  to  make  an
                 application more recovery resilient.
