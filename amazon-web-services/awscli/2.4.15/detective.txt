NAME
       detective -

DESCRIPTION
       Detective  uses  machine  learning  and purpose-built visualizations to
       help you to analyze and investigate security issues across your  Amazon
       Web  Services  (Amazon Web Services) workloads. Detective automatically
       extracts time-based events such as login attempts, API calls, and  net-
       work  traffic  from CloudTrail and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon
       VPC) flow logs. It also extracts findings detected by Amazon GuardDuty.

       The  Detective  API  primarily  supports the creation and management of
       behavior graphs. A behavior graph contains the extracted  data  from  a
       set  of member accounts, and is created and managed by an administrator
       account.

       To add a member  account  to  the  behavior  graph,  the  administrator
       account  sends  an  invitation to the account. When the account accepts
       the invitation, it becomes a member account in the behavior graph.

       Detective is also integrated with Organizations. The organization  man-
       agement  account designates the Detective administrator account for the
       organization. That account becomes the administrator  account  for  the
       organization  behavior  graph.  The Detective administrator account can
       enable any organization account as a member account in the organization
       behavior  graph.  The organization accounts do not receive invitations.
       The Detective administrator account can also invite other  accounts  to
       the organization behavior graph.

       Every  behavior graph is specific to a Region. You can only use the API
       to manage behavior graphs that belong to the Region that is  associated
       with the currently selected endpoint.

       The  administrator  account  for a behavior graph can use the Detective
       API to do the following:

       o Enable and disable Detective. Enabling Detective creates a new behav-
         ior graph.

       o View the list of member accounts in a behavior graph.

       o Add member accounts to a behavior graph.

       o Remove member accounts from a behavior graph.

       o Apply tags to a behavior graph.

       The organization management account can use the Detective API to select
       the delegated administrator for Detective.

       The Detective administrator account for an  organization  can  use  the
       Detective API to do the following:

       o Perform all of the functions of an administrator account.

       o Determine  whether  to automatically enable new organization accounts
         as member accounts in the organization behavior graph.

       An invited member account can use the Detective API to do  the  follow-
       ing:

       o View the list of behavior graphs that they are invited to.

       o Accept an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.

       o Decline an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.

       o Remove their account from a behavior graph.

       All  API actions are logged as CloudTrail events. See Logging Detective
       API Calls with CloudTrail .

       NOTE:
          We replaced the term "master account" with the  term  "administrator
          account."  An administrator account is used to centrally manage mul-
          tiple accounts. In the case of Detective, the administrator  account
          manages the accounts in their behavior graph.
