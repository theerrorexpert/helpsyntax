LIST-HARVEST-JOBS()                                        LIST-HARVEST-JOBS()



NAME
       list-harvest-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a collection of HarvestJob records.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-harvest-jobs  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: HarvestJobs

SYNOPSIS
            list-harvest-jobs
          [--include-channel-id <value>]
          [--include-status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --include-channel-id (string) When specified, the request  will  return
       only HarvestJobs associated with the given Channel ID.

       --include-status  (string) When specified, the request will return only
       HarvestJobs in the given status.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       HarvestJobs -> (list)
          A list of HarvestJob records.

          (structure)
              A HarvestJob resource configuration

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) assigned to the HarvestJob.

              ChannelId -> (string)
                 The  ID of the Channel that the HarvestJob will harvest from.

              CreatedAt -> (string)
                 The time the HarvestJob was submitted

              EndTime -> (string)
                 The end of the time-window which will be harvested.

              Id -> (string)
                 The ID of the HarvestJob. The ID must be  unique  within  the
                 region  and it cannot be changed after the HarvestJob is sub-
                 mitted.

              OriginEndpointId -> (string)
                 The ID of the OriginEndpoint that the HarvestJob will harvest
                 from.  This cannot be changed after the HarvestJob is submit-
                 ted.

              S3Destination -> (structure)
                 Configuration parameters for where in an S3 bucket  to  place
                 the harvested content

                 BucketName -> (string)
                     The  name  of an S3 bucket within which harvested content
                     will be exported

                 ManifestKey -> (string)
                     The key in the specified S3 bucket  where  the  harvested
                     top-level manifest will be placed.

                 RoleArn -> (string)
                     The IAM role used to write to the specified S3 bucket

              StartTime -> (string)
                 The start of the time-window which will be harvested.

              Status -> (string)
                 The  current  status of the HarvestJob. Consider setting up a
                 CloudWatch Event to listen for HarvestJobs as they succeed or
                 fail.  In  the  event  of  failure, the CloudWatch Event will

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token that can be used to resume pagination from the  end  of  the
