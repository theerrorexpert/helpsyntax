LIST-ORIGIN-ENDPOINTS()                                LIST-ORIGIN-ENDPOINTS()



NAME
       list-origin-endpoints -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a collection of OriginEndpoint records.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-origin-endpoints  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: OriginEndpoints

SYNOPSIS
            list-origin-endpoints
          [--channel-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel-id (string) When specified,  the  request  will  return  only
       OriginEndpoints associated with the given Channel ID.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list all origin-endpoints on a channel

       The following list-origin-endpoints command lists  all  of  the  origin
       endpoints that are configured on the channel named test.

                        EncryptionContractConfiguration -> (structure)
                            Use  encryptionContractConfiguration  to configure
                            one or more content encryption keys for your  end-
                            points that use SPEKE 2.0. The encryption contract
                            defines which content keys are used to encrypt the
                            audio  and video tracks in your stream. To config-
                            ure the encryption contract, specify  which  audio

                            lowing considerations  when  using  encryptionCon-
                            tractConfiguration:   encryptionContractConfigura-
                            tion can be used for DASH or CMAF  endpoints  that
                            use  SPEKE  2.0.  SPEKE 2.0 relies on the CPIX 2.3
                            specification. You must disable key  rotation  for
                            this  endpoint  by setting keyRotationIntervalSec-
                            onds to 0.

                            PresetSpeke20Audio -> (string)
                               A collection of audio encryption presets.

                        RoleArn -> (string)
                            An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role  that
                            AWS   Elemental   MediaPackage  will  assume  when
                            accessing the key provider service.

                        SystemIds -> (list)
                            The system IDs to include in key requests.

                            (string)

                            The URL of the external key provider service.

                 HlsManifests -> (list)
                     A list of HLS manifest configurations

                     (structure)
                        A HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) manifest configuration.

                        AdMarkers -> (string)
                            This setting controls how ad markers are  included
                            in  the  packaged OriginEndpoint. "NONE" will omit
                            all  SCTE-35   ad   markers   from   the   output.
                            "PASSTHROUGH"  causes  the  manifest  to contain a
                            copy of the SCTE-35 ad  markers  (comments)  taken
                            directly  from the input HTTP Live Streaming (HLS)
                            manifest. "SCTE35_ENHANCED" generates  ad  markers
                            and blackout tags based on SCTE-35 messages in the
                            input source. "DATERANGE" inserts  EXT-X-DATERANGE
                            tags to signal ad and program transition events in
                            HLS and CMAF manifests. For this option, you  must
                            set a programDateTimeIntervalSeconds value that is
                            greater than 0.

                        Id -> (string)
                            The ID of the manifest.  The  ID  must  be  unique
                            within the OriginEndpoint and it cannot be changed
                            after it is created.

                        IncludeIframeOnlyStream -> (boolean)
                            When enabled,  an  I-Frame  only  stream  will  be
                            included in the output.

                        ManifestName -> (string)
                            An  optional  short  string appended to the end of
                            the OriginEndpoint URL. If not specified, defaults
                            to the manifestName for the OriginEndpoint.

                        PlaylistType -> (string)
                            The  HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) playlist type. When
                            either "EVENT" or "VOD"  is  specified,  a  corre-
                            sponding   EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE   entry   will   be
                            included in the media playlist.

                        PlaylistWindowSeconds -> (integer)
                            Time window (in seconds) contained in each  parent
                            manifest.

                        ProgramDateTimeIntervalSeconds -> (integer)
                            The  interval (in seconds) between each EXT-X-PRO-
                            GRAM-DATE-TIME tag inserted into manifests.  Addi-
                            tionally,  when  an interval is specified ID3Timed
                            Metadata messages will be generated every  5  sec-
                            onds  using the ingest time of the content. If the
                            interval is not specified, or set to  0,  then  no
                            EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tags will be inserted into
                            manifests and no ID3Timed Metadata  messages  will
                            be  generated.  Note  that  irrespective  of  this
                            parameter, if any ID3 Timed Metadata is  found  in
                            HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) input, it will be passed
                            through to HLS output.

                        Url -> (string)
                            The URL of the packaged  OriginEndpoint  for  con-
                            sumption.

                 SegmentDurationSeconds -> (integer)
                     Duration  (in  seconds)  of each segment. Actual segments
                     will be rounded to the nearest  multiple  of  the  source
                     segment duration.

                 SegmentPrefix -> (string)
                     An  optional  custom string that is prepended to the name
                     of each segment. If not specified,  it  defaults  to  the

                 AdsOnDeliveryRestrictions -> (string)
                     This setting allows the  delivery  restriction  flags  on
                     SCTE-35  segmentation  descriptors to determine whether a
                     message signals an ad. Choosing "NONE" means  no  SCTE-35
                     messages  become ads. Choosing "RESTRICTED" means SCTE-35
                     messages of the types specified in AdTriggers  that  con-
                     tain delivery restrictions will be treated as ads. Choos-
                     ing "UNRESTRICTED" means SCTE-35 messages  of  the  types
                     specified  in  AdTriggers  that  do  not contain delivery
                     restrictions will be  treated  as  ads.  Choosing  "BOTH"
