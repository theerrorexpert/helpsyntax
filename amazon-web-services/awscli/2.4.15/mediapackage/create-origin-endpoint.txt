            "CdnIdentifierSecret": "string",
            "SecretsRoleArn": "string"
          }

       --channel-id  (string)  The  ID  of the Channel that the OriginEndpoint
       will be associated with. This cannot be changed  after  the  OriginEnd-
       point is created.

       --cmaf-package  (structure)  A  Common  Media Application Format (CMAF)
       packaging configuration.Encryption -> (structure)
              A Common Media Application Format (CMAF)  encryption  configura-
              tion.

              ConstantInitializationVector -> (string)
                 An  optional  128-bit,  16-byte  hex  value  represented by a
                 32-character string, used in conjunction  with  the  key  for
                 encrypting  blocks. If you don't specify a value, then Media-
                 Package creates the constant initialization vector (IV).

              KeyRotationIntervalSeconds -> (integer)
                 Time (in seconds) between each encryption key rotation.

              SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)
                 A configuration for accessing an external Secure Packager and
                 Encoder  Key  Exchange  (SPEKE)  service  that  will  provide
                 encryption keys.

                 CertificateArn -> (string)
                     An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  a  Certificate  Manager
                     certificate  that  MediaPackage  will  use  for enforcing
                     secure end-to-end data transfer  with  the  key  provider
                     service.

                 EncryptionContractConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Use  encryptionContractConfiguration  to configure one or
                     more content encryption keys for your endpoints that  use
                     SPEKE  2.0. The encryption contract defines which content
                     keys are used to encrypt the audio and  video  tracks  in
                     your  stream. To configure the encryption contract, spec-
                     ify which audio and video encryption presets to use. Note
                     the  following  considerations  when using encryptionCon-
                     tractConfiguration:  encryptionContractConfiguration  can
                     be  used  for  DASH or CMAF endpoints that use SPEKE 2.0.
                     SPEKE 2.0 relies on the CPIX 2.3 specification. You  must
                     disable  key rotation for this endpoint by setting keyRo-
                     tationIntervalSeconds to 0.

                     PresetSpeke20Audio -> (string)
                        A collection of audio encryption presets.

                 RoleArn -> (string)
                     An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an  IAM  role  that  AWS
                     Elemental MediaPackage will assume when accessing the key
                     provider service.

                 SystemIds -> (list)
                     The system IDs to include in key requests.

                     (string)

                 Url -> (string)
                     The URL of the external key provider service.

          HlsManifests -> (list)
              A list of HLS manifest configurations

              (structure)
                 A HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) manifest configuration.

                 AdMarkers -> (string)
                     This setting controls how ad markers are included in  the
                     packaged  OriginEndpoint. "NONE" will omit all SCTE-35 ad
                     markers from the output. "PASSTHROUGH" causes  the  mani-
                     fest  to  contain  a copy of the SCTE-35 ad markers (com-
                     ments) taken directly from the input HTTP Live  Streaming
                     (HLS)  manifest.  "SCTE35_ENHANCED"  generates ad markers
                     and blackout tags based on SCTE-35 messages in the  input
                     source.  "DATERANGE" inserts EXT-X-DATERANGE tags to sig-
                     nal ad and program transition events in HLS and CMAF man-
                     ifests.  For  this  option,  you  must set a programDate-
                     TimeIntervalSeconds value that is greater than 0.

                 AdTriggers -> (list)
                     A list of SCTE-35 message types that are  treated  as  ad
                     markers  in  the output. If empty, no ad markers are out-
                     put. Specify multiple items to create ad markers for  all
                     of the included message types.

                     (string)

                 AdsOnDeliveryRestrictions -> (string)
                     This  setting  allows  the  delivery restriction flags on
                     SCTE-35 segmentation descriptors to determine  whether  a
                     message  signals  an ad. Choosing "NONE" means no SCTE-35
                     messages become ads. Choosing "RESTRICTED" means  SCTE-35
                     messages  of  the types specified in AdTriggers that con-
                     tain delivery restrictions will be treated as ads. Choos-
                     ing  "UNRESTRICTED"  means  SCTE-35 messages of the types
                     specified in AdTriggers  that  do  not  contain  delivery
                     restrictions  will  be  treated  as  ads. Choosing "BOTH"
                     means all SCTE-35 messages  of  the  types  specified  in
                     AdTriggers  will  be  treated  as  ads.  Note that Splice
                     Insert messages do not have these flags  and  are  always
                     treated as ads if specified in AdTriggers.

                 Id -> (string)
                     The  ID of the manifest. The ID must be unique within the
                     OriginEndpoint and it cannot be changed after it is  cre-
                     ated.

                 IncludeIframeOnlyStream -> (boolean)
                     When  enabled, an I-Frame only stream will be included in
                     the output.

                 ManifestName -> (string)
                     An optional short string appended to the end of the Orig-
                     inEndpoint  URL.  If not specified, defaults to the mani-
                     festName for the OriginEndpoint.

                 PlaylistType -> (string)
                     The HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) playlist type. When  either
                     "EVENT"   or   "VOD"   is   specified,   a  corresponding
                     EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE entry will be included in  the  media
                     playlist.

                 PlaylistWindowSeconds -> (integer)
                     Time  window  (in seconds) contained in each parent mani-
                     fest.

                 ProgramDateTimeIntervalSeconds -> (integer)
                     The  interval  (in  seconds)  between   each   EXT-X-PRO-
                     GRAM-DATE-TIME tag inserted into manifests. Additionally,
                     when an interval is specified ID3Timed Metadata  messages
                     will  be  generated every 5 seconds using the ingest time
                     of the content. If the interval is not specified, or  set
                     to  0,  then  no  EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME  tags  will  be
                     inserted into manifests and no ID3Timed Metadata messages
                     will be generated. Note that irrespective of this parame-
                     ter, if any ID3 Timed Metadata  is  found  in  HTTP  Live
                     Streaming  (HLS)  input, it will be passed through to HLS
                     output.

          SegmentDurationSeconds -> (integer)
              Duration (in seconds) of each segment. Actual segments  will  be
              rounded  to the nearest multiple of the source segment duration.

          SegmentPrefix -> (string)
              An optional custom string that is prepended to the name of  each
              segment. If not specified, it defaults to the ChannelId.

       figuration.AdMarkers -> (string)
              This setting controls how ad markers are included in  the  pack-
              aged  OriginEndpoint.  "NONE"  will  omit all SCTE-35 ad markers
              from the output. "PASSTHROUGH" causes the manifest to contain  a
              copy  of  the  SCTE-35 ad markers (comments) taken directly from
              the input HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) manifest.  "SCTE35_ENHANCED"
              generates ad markers and blackout tags based on SCTE-35 messages
              in the input source. "DATERANGE" inserts EXT-X-DATERANGE tags to
              signal  ad  and  program transition events in HLS and CMAF mani-
              fests. For this option, you  must  set  a  programDateTimeInter-
              valSeconds value that is greater than 0.

          AdsOnDeliveryRestrictions -> (string)
              This setting allows the delivery restriction  flags  on  SCTE-35
              segmentation  descriptors to determine whether a message signals
              an ad. Choosing "NONE" means no  SCTE-35  messages  become  ads.
              Choosing "RESTRICTED" means SCTE-35 messages of the types speci-
              fied in AdTriggers that contain delivery  restrictions  will  be
              treated  as  ads. Choosing "UNRESTRICTED" means SCTE-35 messages
              of the types specified in AdTriggers that do not contain  deliv-
              ery  restrictions  will be treated as ads. Choosing "BOTH" means
              all SCTE-35 messages of the types specified in  AdTriggers  will
              be  treated as ads. Note that Splice Insert messages do not have
              these flags and are  always  treated  as  ads  if  specified  in
              AdTriggers.

                 EncryptionContractConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Use  encryptionContractConfiguration  to configure one or
                     more content encryption keys for your endpoints that  use
                     SPEKE  2.0. The encryption contract defines which content
                     keys are used to encrypt the audio and  video  tracks  in
                     your  stream. To configure the encryption contract, spec-
                     ify which audio and video encryption presets to use. Note
                     the  following  considerations  when using encryptionCon-
                     tractConfiguration:  encryptionContractConfiguration  can
                     be  used  for  DASH or CMAF endpoints that use SPEKE 2.0.
                     SPEKE 2.0 relies on the CPIX 2.3 specification. You  must
                     disable  key rotation for this endpoint by setting keyRo-
                     tationIntervalSeconds to 0.

              specified ID3Timed Metadata messages will be generated  every  5
              seconds using the ingest time of the content. If the interval is
              not specified, or set to 0, then no EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tags
              will  be  inserted  into manifests and no ID3Timed Metadata mes-
              sages will be generated. Note that irrespective of this  parame-

       tent to retain for startover  playback.  If  not  specified,  startover
       playback will be disabled for the OriginEndpoint.

       --tags  (map)  A  collection  of  tags associated with a resourcekey ->
       (string)
          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --time-delay-seconds (integer) Amount of delay (seconds) to enforce  on
       the  playback  of live content. If not specified, there will be no time
       delay in effect for the OriginEndpoint.

       --whitelist (list) A list of source IP CIDR blocks that will be allowed
       to access the OriginEndpoint.(string)

       Syntax:

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

              KeyRotationIntervalSeconds -> (integer)
                 Time (in seconds) between each encryption key rotation.

              SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)
                 A configuration for accessing an external Secure Packager and
                 Encoder  Key  Exchange  (SPEKE)  service  that  will  provide
                 encryption keys.

                     service.

                 EncryptionContractConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Use encryptionContractConfiguration to configure  one  or
                     more  content encryption keys for your endpoints that use
                     SPEKE 2.0. The encryption contract defines which  content
                     keys  are  used  to encrypt the audio and video tracks in
                     your stream. To configure the encryption contract,  spec-
                     ify which audio and video encryption presets to use. Note
                     the following considerations  when  using  encryptionCon-
                     tractConfiguration:  encryptionContractConfiguration  can
                     be used for DASH or CMAF endpoints that  use  SPEKE  2.0.
                     SPEKE  2.0 relies on the CPIX 2.3 specification. You must
                     disable key rotation for this endpoint by setting  keyRo-
                     tationIntervalSeconds to 0.

                     PresetSpeke20Audio -> (string)
                        A collection of audio encryption presets.

              A list of HLS manifest configurations

              (structure)
                 A HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) manifest configuration.

                 AdMarkers -> (string)
                     This  setting controls how ad markers are included in the
                     packaged OriginEndpoint. "NONE" will omit all SCTE-35  ad
                     markers  from  the output. "PASSTHROUGH" causes the mani-
                     fest to contain a copy of the SCTE-35  ad  markers  (com-
                     ments)  taken directly from the input HTTP Live Streaming
                     (HLS) manifest. "SCTE35_ENHANCED"  generates  ad  markers
                     and  blackout tags based on SCTE-35 messages in the input
                     source. "DATERANGE" inserts EXT-X-DATERANGE tags to  sig-
                     nal ad and program transition events in HLS and CMAF man-
                     ifests. For this option,  you  must  set  a  programDate-
                     TimeIntervalSeconds value that is greater than 0.

                 Id -> (string)
                     The  ID of the manifest. The ID must be unique within the
                     OriginEndpoint and it cannot be changed after it is  cre-
                     ated.

                 IncludeIframeOnlyStream -> (boolean)
                     When  enabled, an I-Frame only stream will be included in
                     the output.

                 ManifestName -> (string)
                     An optional short string appended to the end of the Orig-
                     inEndpoint  URL.  If not specified, defaults to the mani-
                     festName for the OriginEndpoint.

                 PlaylistType -> (string)

                     "EVENT"   or   "VOD"   is   specified,   a  corresponding
                     EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE entry will be included in  the  media
                     playlist.

                 PlaylistWindowSeconds -> (integer)
                     Time  window  (in seconds) contained in each parent mani-
                     fest.

                 ProgramDateTimeIntervalSeconds -> (integer)
                     The  interval  (in  seconds)  between   each   EXT-X-PRO-
                     GRAM-DATE-TIME tag inserted into manifests. Additionally,
                     when an interval is specified ID3Timed Metadata  messages
                     will  be  generated every 5 seconds using the ingest time
                     of the content. If the interval is not specified, or  set
                     to  0,  then  no  EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME  tags  will  be
                     inserted into manifests and no ID3Timed Metadata messages
                     will be generated. Note that irrespective of this parame-
                     ter, if any ID3 Timed Metadata  is  found  in  HTTP  Live
                     Streaming  (HLS)  input, it will be passed through to HLS
                     output.

                 Url -> (string)
                     The URL of the packaged OriginEndpoint for consumption.

          SegmentDurationSeconds -> (integer)
              Duration (in seconds) of each segment. Actual segments  will  be
              rounded  to the nearest multiple of the source segment duration.

          SegmentPrefix -> (string)
              An optional custom string that is prepended to the name of  each
              segment. If not specified, it defaults to the ChannelId.

          StreamSelection -> (structure)

              tiple items to create ad markers for all of the included message
              types.

              (string)

          AdsOnDeliveryRestrictions -> (string)
              This setting allows the delivery restriction  flags  on  SCTE-35
              segmentation  descriptors to determine whether a message signals
              an ad. Choosing "NONE" means no  SCTE-35  messages  become  ads.
              Choosing "RESTRICTED" means SCTE-35 messages of the types speci-
              fied in AdTriggers that contain delivery  restrictions  will  be
              treated  as  ads. Choosing "UNRESTRICTED" means SCTE-35 messages
              of the types specified in AdTriggers that do not contain  deliv-
              ery  restrictions  will be treated as ads. Choosing "BOTH" means
              all SCTE-35 messages of the types specified in  AdTriggers  will
              be  treated as ads. Note that Splice Insert messages do not have
              these flags and are  always  treated  as  ads  if  specified  in

                     more content encryption keys for your endpoints that  use
                     SPEKE  2.0. The encryption contract defines which content
                     keys are used to encrypt the audio and  video  tracks  in
                     your  stream. To configure the encryption contract, spec-
                     ify which audio and video encryption presets to use. Note
                     the  following  considerations  when using encryptionCon-
                     tractConfiguration:  encryptionContractConfiguration  can
                     be  used  for  DASH or CMAF endpoints that use SPEKE 2.0.
                     SPEKE 2.0 relies on the CPIX 2.3 specification. You  must
                     disable  key rotation for this endpoint by setting keyRo-

              an ad. Choosing "NONE" means no  SCTE-35  messages  become  ads.
              Choosing "RESTRICTED" means SCTE-35 messages of the types speci-
              fied in AdTriggers that contain delivery  restrictions  will  be
              treated  as  ads. Choosing "UNRESTRICTED" means SCTE-35 messages
              of the types specified in AdTriggers that do not contain  deliv-
              ery  restrictions  will be treated as ads. Choosing "BOTH" means
              all SCTE-35 messages of the types specified in  AdTriggers  will
              be  treated as ads. Note that Splice Insert messages do not have
              these flags and are  always  treated  as  ads  if  specified  in
              AdTriggers.

                     Use  encryptionContractConfiguration  to configure one or
                     more content encryption keys for your endpoints that  use
                     SPEKE  2.0. The encryption contract defines which content
                     keys are used to encrypt the audio and  video  tracks  in
                     your  stream. To configure the encryption contract, spec-
                     ify which audio and video encryption presets to use. Note
                     the  following  considerations  when using encryptionCon-
                     tractConfiguration:  encryptionContractConfiguration  can
                     be  used  for  DASH or CMAF endpoints that use SPEKE 2.0.
                     SPEKE 2.0 relies on the CPIX 2.3 specification. You  must
                     disable  key rotation for this endpoint by setting keyRo-
                     tationIntervalSeconds to 0.

              specified ID3Timed Metadata messages will be generated  every  5
              seconds using the ingest time of the content. If the interval is
              not specified, or set to 0, then no EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tags
              will  be  inserted  into manifests and no ID3Timed Metadata mes-
