NAME
       describe-origin-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets details about an existing OriginEndpoint.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-origin-endpoint
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string) The ID of the OriginEndpoint.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 encrypting  blocks. If you don't specify a value, then Media-
                 Package creates the constant initialization vector (IV).

              KeyRotationIntervalSeconds -> (integer)
                 Time (in seconds) between each encryption key rotation.

              SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)
                 A configuration for accessing an external Secure Packager and
                 Encoder  Key  Exchange  (SPEKE)  service  that  will  provide
                 encryption keys.

                 CertificateArn -> (string)
                     An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  a  Certificate  Manager
                     certificate  that  MediaPackage  will  use  for enforcing
                     secure end-to-end data transfer  with  the  key  provider
                     service.

                 EncryptionContractConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Use  encryptionContractConfiguration  to configure one or
                     more content encryption keys for your endpoints that  use
                     SPEKE  2.0. The encryption contract defines which content
                     keys are used to encrypt the audio and  video  tracks  in
                     your  stream. To configure the encryption contract, spec-
                     ify which audio and video encryption presets to use. Note
                     the  following  considerations  when using encryptionCon-
                     tractConfiguration:  encryptionContractConfiguration  can
                     be  used  for  DASH or CMAF endpoints that use SPEKE 2.0.
                     SPEKE 2.0 relies on the CPIX 2.3 specification. You  must
                     disable  key rotation for this endpoint by setting keyRo-
                     tationIntervalSeconds to 0.

                     PresetSpeke20Audio -> (string)
                        A collection of audio encryption presets.

                     PresetSpeke20Video -> (string)
                        A collection of video encryption presets.

                 RoleArn -> (string)
                     An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an  IAM  role  that  AWS
                     Elemental MediaPackage will assume when accessing the key
                     provider service.

                 SystemIds -> (list)
                     The system IDs to include in key requests.

                     (string)

                 Url -> (string)
                     The URL of the external key provider service.

          HlsManifests -> (list)
              A list of HLS manifest configurations

              (structure)
                 A HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) manifest configuration.

                 AdMarkers -> (string)
                     This setting controls how ad markers are included in  the
                     packaged  OriginEndpoint. "NONE" will omit all SCTE-35 ad
                     markers from the output. "PASSTHROUGH" causes  the  mani-
                     fest  to  contain  a copy of the SCTE-35 ad markers (com-
                     ments) taken directly from the input HTTP Live  Streaming
                     (HLS)  manifest.  "SCTE35_ENHANCED"  generates ad markers
                     and blackout tags based on SCTE-35 messages in the  input
                     source.  "DATERANGE" inserts EXT-X-DATERANGE tags to sig-
                     nal ad and program transition events in HLS and CMAF man-
                     ifests.  For  this  option,  you  must set a programDate-
                     TimeIntervalSeconds value that is greater than 0.

                 Id -> (string)
                     The ID of the manifest. The ID must be unique within  the
                     OriginEndpoint  and it cannot be changed after it is cre-
                     ated.

                 IncludeIframeOnlyStream -> (boolean)
                     When enabled, an I-Frame only stream will be included  in
                     the output.

                 ManifestName -> (string)
                     An optional short string appended to the end of the Orig-
                     inEndpoint URL. If not specified, defaults to  the  mani-
                     festName for the OriginEndpoint.

                 PlaylistType -> (string)
                     The  HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) playlist type. When either
                     "EVENT"  or   "VOD"   is   specified,   a   corresponding
                     EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE  entry  will be included in the media
                     playlist.

                 PlaylistWindowSeconds -> (integer)
                     Time window (in seconds) contained in each  parent  mani-
                     fest.

                 ProgramDateTimeIntervalSeconds -> (integer)
                     The   interval   (in  seconds)  between  each  EXT-X-PRO-
                     GRAM-DATE-TIME tag inserted into manifests. Additionally,
                     when  an interval is specified ID3Timed Metadata messages
                     will be generated every 5 seconds using the  ingest  time
                     of  the content. If the interval is not specified, or set
                     to  0,  then  no  EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME  tags  will  be
                     inserted into manifests and no ID3Timed Metadata messages
                     will be generated. Note that irrespective of this parame-
                     ter,  if  any  ID3  Timed  Metadata is found in HTTP Live
                     Streaming (HLS) input, it will be passed through  to  HLS
                     output.

                 Url -> (string)
                     The URL of the packaged OriginEndpoint for consumption.

          SegmentDurationSeconds -> (integer)
              Duration  (in  seconds) of each segment. Actual segments will be
              rounded to the nearest multiple of the source segment  duration.

          SegmentPrefix -> (string)
              An  optional custom string that is prepended to the name of each
              segment. If not specified, it defaults to the ChannelId.

          StreamSelection -> (structure)
              A StreamSelection configuration.

              A list of SCTE-35 message types that are treated as  ad  markers
              in  the output. If empty, no ad markers are output. Specify mul-
              tiple items to create ad markers for all of the included message
              types.

              (string)

          AdsOnDeliveryRestrictions -> (string)
              This  setting  allows  the delivery restriction flags on SCTE-35
              segmentation descriptors to determine whether a message  signals
              an  ad.  Choosing  "NONE"  means no SCTE-35 messages become ads.
              Choosing "RESTRICTED" means SCTE-35 messages of the types speci-
              fied  in  AdTriggers  that contain delivery restrictions will be
              treated as ads. Choosing "UNRESTRICTED" means  SCTE-35  messages
              of  the types specified in AdTriggers that do not contain deliv-
              ery restrictions will be treated as ads. Choosing  "BOTH"  means
              all  SCTE-35  messages of the types specified in AdTriggers will
              be treated as ads. Note that Splice Insert messages do not  have
              these  flags  and  are  always  treated  as  ads if specified in
              AdTriggers.

                 Encoder  Key  Exchange  (SPEKE)  service  that  will  provide
                 encryption keys.

                 CertificateArn -> (string)
                     An  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of a Certificate Manager
                     certificate that  MediaPackage  will  use  for  enforcing
                     secure  end-to-end  data  transfer  with the key provider
                     service.

                 EncryptionContractConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Use encryptionContractConfiguration to configure  one  or
                     more  content encryption keys for your endpoints that use
                     SPEKE 2.0. The encryption contract defines which  content
                     keys  are  used  to encrypt the audio and video tracks in
                     your stream. To configure the encryption contract,  spec-
                     ify which audio and video encryption presets to use. Note
                     the following considerations  when  using  encryptionCon-
                     tractConfiguration:  encryptionContractConfiguration  can
                     be used for DASH or CMAF endpoints that  use  SPEKE  2.0.
                     SPEKE  2.0 relies on the CPIX 2.3 specification. You must
                     disable key rotation for this endpoint by setting  keyRo-
                     tationIntervalSeconds to 0.

              aged OriginEndpoint. "NONE" will omit  all  SCTE-35  ad  markers
              from  the output. "PASSTHROUGH" causes the manifest to contain a
              copy of the SCTE-35 ad markers (comments)  taken  directly  from
              the  input HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) manifest. "SCTE35_ENHANCED"
              generates ad markers and blackout tags based on SCTE-35 messages
              in the input source. "DATERANGE" inserts EXT-X-DATERANGE tags to
              signal ad and program transition events in HLS  and  CMAF  mani-
              fests.  For  this  option,  you must set a programDateTimeInter-
              valSeconds value that is greater than 0.

              tiple items to create ad markers for all of the included message
              types.

              (string)

          AdsOnDeliveryRestrictions -> (string)
              This  setting  allows  the delivery restriction flags on SCTE-35
              segmentation descriptors to determine whether a message  signals
              an  ad.  Choosing  "NONE"  means no SCTE-35 messages become ads.
              Choosing "RESTRICTED" means SCTE-35 messages of the types speci-
              fied  in  AdTriggers  that contain delivery restrictions will be
              treated as ads. Choosing "UNRESTRICTED" means  SCTE-35  messages
              of  the types specified in AdTriggers that do not contain deliv-
              ery restrictions will be treated as ads. Choosing  "BOTH"  means
              all  SCTE-35  messages of the types specified in AdTriggers will
              be treated as ads. Note that Splice Insert messages do not  have
              these  flags  and  are  always  treated  as  ads if specified in
              AdTriggers.

                     more  content encryption keys for your endpoints that use
                     SPEKE 2.0. The encryption contract defines which  content
                     keys  are  used  to encrypt the audio and video tracks in
                     your stream. To configure the encryption contract,  spec-
                     ify which audio and video encryption presets to use. Note

                     tractConfiguration:  encryptionContractConfiguration  can
                     be used for DASH or CMAF endpoints that  use  SPEKE  2.0.
                     SPEKE  2.0 relies on the CPIX 2.3 specification. You must
                     disable key rotation for this endpoint by setting  keyRo-
                     tationIntervalSeconds to 0.

              specified  ID3Timed  Metadata messages will be generated every 5
              seconds using the ingest time of the content. If the interval is
              not specified, or set to 0, then no EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tags
              will be inserted into manifests and no  ID3Timed  Metadata  mes-
