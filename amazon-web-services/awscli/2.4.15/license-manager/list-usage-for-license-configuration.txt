LIST-USAGE-FOR-LICENSE-CONFIGURATION()  LIST-USAGE-FOR-LICENSE-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       list-usage-for-license-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all license usage records for a license configuration, displaying
       license consumption details by resource at a selected  point  in  time.
       Use  this  action  to  audit  the  current  license consumption for any
       license inventory and configuration.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-usage-for-license-configuration is a paginated operation. Multiple
       API  calls  may  be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: LicenseConfigurationUsageList

SYNOPSIS
            list-usage-for-license-configuration
          --license-configuration-arn <value>
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --license-configuration-arn (string)
          Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the license configuration.

       --filters (list)
          Filters  to  scope  the  results.  The following filters and logical
          operators are supported:

          o resourceArn - The ARN of the license configuration resource. Logi-
            cal operators are EQUALS | NOT_EQUALS .

          o resourceType  -  The  resource  type  (EC2_INSTANCE  |  EC2_HOST |
            EC2_AMI | SYSTEMS_MANAGER_MANAGED_INSTANCE  ).  Logical  operators
            are EQUALS | NOT_EQUALS .

          o resourceAccount  -  The  ID of the account that owns the resource.
            Logical operators are EQUALS | NOT_EQUALS .

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to  return  more  spe-
              cific  results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to
              match a set of resources by specific  criteria,  such  as  tags,
              attributes, or IDs.

              Name -> (string)
                 Name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 Filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the licenses in use for a license configuration

       The following list-usage-for-license-configuration example lists infor-
       mation  about  the  resources  using licenses for the specified license
       configuration. For example, if the license type is vCPU, any  instances
       consume one license per vCPU.

       Output:

          {
              "LicenseConfigurationUsageList": [

                      "ResourceType": "EC2_INSTANCE",
                      "ResourceStatus": "running",
                      "ResourceOwnerId": "123456789012",
                      "AssociationTime": 1570892850.519,
                      "ConsumedLicenses": 2
                  }
              ]
          }
