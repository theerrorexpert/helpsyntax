DESCRIPTION
       Describes the license configurations for the specified resource.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-license-specifications-for-resource is a paginated operation. Mul-
       tiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data  set
       of  results.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: LicenseSpecifications

SYNOPSIS
            list-license-specifications-for-resource
          --resource-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a  resource  that  has  an  associated
          license configuration.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       To list the license configurations for a resource

       The following  list-license-specifications-for-resource  example  lists
       the license configurations associated with the specified Amazon Machine
       Image (AMI).

          aws license-manager list-license-specifications-for-resource \
              --resource-arn arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2::image/ami-1234567890abcdef0

       Output:

          {
              "LicenseConfigurationArn": "arn:aws:license-manager:us-west-2:123456789012:license-configuration:lic-38b658717b87478aaa7c00883EXAMPLE"
          }

OUTPUT
       LicenseSpecifications -> (list)
          License configurations associated with a resource.

          (structure)
              Details for associating a license configuration with a resource.

              LicenseConfigurationArn -> (string)
                 Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the license configuration.

              AmiAssociationScope -> (string)
                 Scope   of   AMI   associations.   The   possible   value  is
                 cross-account .

       NextToken -> (string)
