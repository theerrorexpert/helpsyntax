NAME
       list-realtime-contact-analysis-segments -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  a list of analysis segments for a real-time analysis session.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-realtime-contact-analysis-segments
          --instance-id <value>
          --contact-id <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The identifier of the Amazon Connect instance.

       --contact-id (string)
          The identifier of the contact.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximimum number of results to return per page.

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next set of results. Use the value returned in the
          previous  response  in  the next request to retrieve the next set of
          results.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     value -> (structure)
                        Provides  information about the category rule that was
                        matched.

                        PointsOfInterest -> (list)
                            The section of audio where the category  rule  was

       NextToken -> (string)
          If there are additional results, this is the token for the next  set
          of  results.  If  response includes nextToken there are two possible
          scenarios:

          o There are more segments so another call is required to get them.

          o There are no more segments at this time, but more may be available
            later  (real-time  analysis  is  in progress) so the client should
            call the operation again to get new segments.

          If response does not include nextToken , the analysis  is  completed
          (successfully or failed) and there are no more segments to retrieve.
