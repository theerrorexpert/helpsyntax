NAME
       update-scheduling-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates a scheduling policy.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-scheduling-policy
          --arn <value>
          [--fairshare-policy <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the scheduling policy to update.

       --fairshare-policy (structure)
          The fair share policy.

          shareDecaySeconds -> (integer)
              The  time period to use to calculate a fair share percentage for
              each fair share identifier in use, in seconds. A value  of  zero
              (0)  indicates  that  only current usage should be measured. The
              decay allows for more recently run jobs to have more weight than
              jobs  that ran earlier. The maximum supported value is 604800 (1
              week).

          computeReservation -> (integer)
              A value used to reserve some of the available maximum  vCPU  for
              fair share identifiers that have not yet been used.

              The reserved ratio is
              ``
              (computeReservation /100)^*ActiveFairShares* `` where `` Active-
              FairShares `` is the number of active fair share identifiers.

              For example, a computeReservation value  of  50  indicates  that
              Batch  should reserve 50% of the maximum available vCPU if there
              is only one fair share identifier, 25% if  there  are  two  fair
              share identifiers, and 12.5% if there are three fair share iden-
              tifiers. A computeReservation value of 25 indicates  that  Batch
              should  reserve  25%  of  the maximum available vCPU if there is
              only one fair share identifier, 6.25%  if  there  are  two  fair
              share identifiers, and 1.56% if there are three fair share iden-
              tifiers.

              The minimum value is 0 and the maximum value is 99.

          shareDistribution -> (list)
              An array of SharedIdentifier objects that  contain  the  weights
              for  the  fair share identifiers for the fair share policy. Fair
              share identifiers that aren't included have a default weight  of
              1.0 .

              (structure)
                 Specifies  the weights for the fair share identifiers for the
                 fair  share  policy.  Fair  share  identifiers  that   aren't
                 included have a default weight of 1.0 .

                 shareIdentifier -> (string)
                     A  fair share identifier or fair share identifier prefix.
                     If the string ends with an asterisk (*), this entry spec-
                     ifies the weight factor to use for fair share identifiers
                     that start with that prefix. The list of fair share iden-
                     tifiers  in a fair share policy cannot overlap. For exam-
                     ple, you can't have one that specifies a  shareIdentifier
                     of UserA* and another that specifies a shareIdentifier of
                     UserA-1 .

                     There can be no more  than  500  fair  share  identifiers
                     active in a job queue.

                     The  string  is  limited  to 255 alphanumeric characters,
                     optionally followed by an asterisk (*).

                 weightFactor -> (float)
                     The weight factor for  the  fair  share  identifier.  The
                     default value is 1.0. A lower value has a higher priority
                     for compute resources. For example, jobs that use a share
                     identifier  with  a  weight  factor  of 0.125 (1/8) get 8
                     times the compute resources of  jobs  that  use  a  share
                     identifier with a weight factor of 1.

                     The  smallest  supported value is 0.0001, and the largest
                     supported value is 999.9999.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          shareDecaySeconds=integer,computeReservation=integer,shareDistribution=[{shareIdentifier=string,weightFactor=float},{shareIdentifier=string,weightFactor=float}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "shareDecaySeconds": integer,
            "computeReservation": integer,
            "shareDistribution": [
              {
                "shareIdentifier": "string",
                "weightFactor": float
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
