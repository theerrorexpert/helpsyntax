NAME
       update-job-queue -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates a job queue.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-job-queue
          --job-queue <value>
          [--state <value>]
          [--scheduling-policy-arn <value>]
          [--priority <value>]
          [--compute-environment-order <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-queue (string)
          The name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job queue.

       --state (string)
          Describes  the  queue's ability to accept new jobs. If the job queue
          state is ENABLED , it can accept jobs. If the  job  queue  state  is
          DISABLED , new jobs can't be added to the queue, but jobs already in
          the queue can finish.

          Possible values:

          o ENABLED

          o DISABLED

       --scheduling-policy-arn (string)
          Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the fair share scheduling policy. Once
          a  job  queue  is  created,  the fair share scheduling policy can be
          replaced  but   not   removed.   The   format   is   aws:*Partition*
          :batch:*Region*  :*Account* :scheduling-policy/*Name* `` . For exam-
          ple,          ``aws:aws:batch:us-west-2:012345678910:scheduling-pol-
          icy/MySchedulingPolicy .

       --priority (integer)
          The priority of the job queue. Job queues with a higher priority (or
          a higher integer value for the  priority  parameter)  are  evaluated
          first when associated with the same compute environment. Priority is
          determined in descending order, for example, a job queue with a pri-
          ority  value  of  10 is given scheduling preference over a job queue
          with a priority value of 1 . All of the compute environments must be
          either EC2 (EC2 or SPOT ) or Fargate (FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT ). EC2
          and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.

       --compute-environment-order (list)
          Details the set of compute environments mapped to a  job  queue  and
          their  order  relative  to each other. This is one of the parameters
          used by the job scheduler to  determine  which  compute  environment
          should  run  a  given job. Compute environments must be in the VALID
          state before you can associate them with a job  queue.  All  of  the
          compute  environments  must  be either EC2 (EC2 or SPOT ) or Fargate
          (FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT ). EC2  and  Fargate  compute  environments
          can't be mixed.

          NOTE:
              All  compute  environments  that are associated with a job queue
              must share the same architecture. Batch doesn't  support  mixing
              compute environment architecture types in a single job queue.

          (structure)
              The order in which compute environments are tried for job place-
              ment within a queue. Compute environments are tried in ascending
              order.  For  example, if two compute environments are associated
              with a job queue, the compute environment  with  a  lower  order
              integer value is tried for job placement first. Compute environ-
              ments must be in the VALID state before you can  associate  them
              with a job queue. All of the compute environments must be either
              EC2 (EC2 or SPOT ) or Fargate (FARGATE or  FARGATE_SPOT  );  EC2
              and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.

              NOTE:
                 All compute environments that are associated with a job queue
                 must share the same architecture. Batch doesn't support  mix-
                 ing  compute  environment  architecture types in a single job
                 queue.

              order -> (integer)
                 The order of the compute  environment.  Compute  environments
                 are  tried  in  ascending  order. For example, if two compute
                 environments are associated with a  job  queue,  the  compute
                 environment with a lower order integer value is tried for job
                 placement first.

              computeEnvironment -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the compute environment.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          order=integer,computeEnvironment=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "order": integer,
              "computeEnvironment": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update a job queue

       This example disables a job queue so that it can be deleted.

       Command:

          aws batch update-job-queue --job-queue GPGPU --state DISABLED

       Output:

          {
              "jobQueueArn": "arn:aws:batch:us-east-1:012345678910:job-queue/GPGPU",
              "jobQueueName": "GPGPU"
          }

OUTPUT
       jobQueueName -> (string)
          The name of the job queue.

       jobQueueArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job queue.
