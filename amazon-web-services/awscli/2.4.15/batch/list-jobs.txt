LIST-JOBS()                                                        LIST-JOBS()



NAME
       list-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of Batch jobs.

       You must specify only one of the following items:

       o A job queue ID to return a list of jobs in that job queue

       o A multi-node parallel job ID to return a list of nodes for that job

       o An array job ID to return a list of the children for that job

       You  can filter the results by job status with the jobStatus parameter.
       If you don't specify a status, only RUNNING jobs are returned.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in
       order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagi-
       nation by providing the --no-paginate argument.   When  using  --output
       text  and  the  --query  argument  on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the  results  of  the  following  query
       expressions: jobSummaryList

          [--job-queue <value>]
          [--array-job-id <value>]
          [--multi-node-job-id <value>]
          [--job-status <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-queue (string)
          The name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job queue used to
          list jobs.

       --array-job-id (string)
          The job ID for an array job. Specifying an array job  ID  with  this
          parameter lists all child jobs from within the specified array.

       --multi-node-job-id (string)
          The  job  ID  for a multi-node parallel job. Specifying a multi-node
          parallel job ID with this parameter lists all nodes that are associ-
          ated with the specified job.

       --job-status (string)
          The  job  status  used to filter jobs in the specified queue. If the
          filters parameter is specified, the jobStatus parameter  is  ignored
          and  jobs  with any status are returned. If you don't specify a sta-
          tus, only RUNNING jobs are returned.

          Possible values:

          o SUBMITTED

          o PENDING

          o RUNNABLE

          o STARTING

          o RUNNING

          o SUCCEEDED

          o FAILED

       --filters (list)
          The filter to apply to the query. Only one filter can be used  at  a
          time.  When  the  filter  is  used, jobStatus is ignored. The filter
          doesn't apply to child jobs in an array or multi-node parallel (MNP)
          jobs.  The  results are sorted by the createdAt field, with the most
          recent jobs being first.
              JOB_NAME

          The value of the filter is a  case-insensitive  match  for  the  job
          name.  If the value ends with an asterisk (*), the filter will match
          any job name that begins with the string before the '*'. This corre-
          sponds  to  the jobName value. For example, test1 matches both Test1
          and test1 , and test1* matches both test1  and  Test10  .  When  the
          JOB_NAME filter is used, the results are grouped by the job name and
          version.
              JOB_DEFINITION

          The value for the filter is the name or Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)
          of  the job definition. This corresponds to the jobDefinition value.
          The value is case sensitive. When the value for the  filter  is  the
          job  definition name, the results include all the jobs that used any
          revision of that job definition name. If  the  value  ends  with  an
          asterisk  (*),  the  filter  will match any job definition name that
          begins with the string before the '*'. For example, jd1 matches only
          jd1  ,  and  jd1* matches both jd1 and jd1A . The version of the job
          definition that's used doesn't  affect  the  sort  order.  When  the
          JOB_DEFINITION  filter  is used and the ARN is used (which is in the
          form         arn:${Partition}:batch:${Region}:${Account}:job-defini-
          tion/${JobDefinitionName}:${Revision}  ),  the  results include jobs
          that used the specified revision of the job definition. Asterisk (*)
          is not supported when the ARN is used.
              BEFORE_CREATED_AT

          The  value for the filter is the time that's before the job was cre-
          ated. This corresponds to the createdAt value. The value is a string
          representation  of  the  number  of  milliseconds since 00:00:00 UTC
          (midnight) on January 1, 1970.
              AFTER_CREATED_AT

          The value for the filter is the time that's after the job  was  cre-
          ated. This corresponds to the createdAt value. The value is a string
          representation of the number  of  milliseconds  since  00:00:00  UTC
          (midnight) on January 1, 1970.
              (structure)

              A  filter  name and value pair that's used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a ListJobs API operation.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case sensitive.

              values -> (list)
                 The filter values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list running jobs

       This example lists the running jobs in the HighPriority job queue.

       Command:

       To list submitted jobs

       This  example  lists jobs in the HighPriority job queue that are in the
       SUBMITTED job status.

       Command:

          aws batch list-jobs --job-queue HighPriority --job-status SUBMITTED

                      "jobId": "68f0c163-fbd4-44e6-9fd1-25b14a434786"
                  }
              ]
          }

                 when the job entered the SUBMITTED state (at the  time   Sub-
                 mitJob  was  called).  For array child jobs, this is when the
                 child job was spawned by its parent and entered  the  PENDING
                 state.

              status -> (string)
                 The current status for the job.

                 transitioned from the STARTING state to the RUNNING state).

              stoppedAt -> (long)
                 The Unix timestamp for when the job was stopped (when the job
                 transitioned from the RUNNING state to a terminal state, such
                 as SUCCEEDED or FAILED ).

              container -> (structure)
                 An  object  representing  the details of the container that's
                 associated with the job.

                 exitCode -> (integer)
                     The exit code to return upon completion.

                 reason -> (string)
                     A short (255 max  characters)  human-readable  string  to
                     provide  additional  details  about  a running or stopped

                     parent array jobs.

                 index -> (integer)
                     The  job  index  within  the array that's associated with
                     this job. This parameter  is  returned  for  children  of
                     array jobs.

              nodeProperties -> (structure)
                 The  node properties for a single node in a job summary list.

                 NOTE:
                     This isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate
                     resources.

                 isMainNode -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether the current node is the main node for a
                     multi-node parallel job.

                 numNodes -> (integer)
                     The number of nodes associated with a multi-node parallel
                     job.

                     The  node index for the node. Node index numbering begins
                     at zero. This index is also available on  the  node  with
                     the AWS_BATCH_JOB_NODE_INDEX environment variable.

              jobDefinition -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job definition.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  nextToken  value  to include in a future ListJobs request. When
          the results of a ListJobs request exceed maxResults , this value can
          be  used  to  retrieve  the next page of results. This value is null
          when there are no more results to return.
