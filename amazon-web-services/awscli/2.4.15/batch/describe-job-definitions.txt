DESCRIBE-JOB-DEFINITIONS()                          DESCRIBE-JOB-DEFINITIONS()



NAME
       describe-job-definitions -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  a list of job definitions. You can specify a status (such as
       ACTIVE ) to only return job definitions that match that status.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-job-definitions is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: jobDefinitions

SYNOPSIS
            describe-job-definitions
          [--job-definitions <value>]
          [--job-definition-name <value>]
          [--status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-definitions (list)
          A  list  of  up  to  100 job definitions. Each entry in the list can
          either       be       an       ARN       in        the        format
          arn:aws:batch:${Region}:${Account}:job-definition/${JobDefinition-
          Name}:${Revision} or a short version using the form ${JobDefinition-
          Name}:${Revision} .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --job-definition-name (string)
          The name of the job definition to describe.

       --status (string)
          The status used to filter job definitions.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       jobDefinitions -> (list)
          The list of job definitions.

          (structure)
              An object representing an Batch job definition.

              jobDefinitionName -> (string)
                 The name of the job definition.

              jobDefinitionArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the job definition.

              revision -> (integer)
                 The revision of the job definition.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the job definition.

              type -> (string)
                 The type of job definition, either container or  multinode  .
                 If  the job is run on Fargate resources, then multinode isn't
                 supported. For more  information  about  multi-node  parallel
                 jobs,  see  Creating  a multi-node parallel job definition in
                 the Batch User Guide .

              schedulingPriority -> (integer)
                 The scheduling priority of  the  job  definition.  This  only
                 affects  jobs  in  job  queues with a fair share policy. Jobs
                 with a higher scheduling priority are scheduled  before  jobs
                 with a lower scheduling priority.

              parameters -> (map)
                 Default  parameters  or  parameter  substitution placeholders
                 that are set in the job definition. Parameters are  specified
                 as  a  key-value  pair  mapping.  Parameters  in  a SubmitJob
                 request override any corresponding  parameter  defaults  from
                 the  job  definition.  For  more information about specifying
                 parameters, see Job Definition Parameters in the  Batch  User
                 Guide .

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              retryStrategy -> (structure)
                 The  retry strategy to use for failed jobs that are submitted
                 with this job definition.

                 attempts -> (integer)
                     The number of times to move a job to the RUNNABLE status.
                     You  can  specify between 1 and 10 attempts. If the value
                     of attempts is greater than one, the job  is  retried  on
                     failure the same number of attempts as the value.

                 evaluateOnExit -> (list)
                     Array  of  up  to 5 objects that specify conditions under
                     which the job should be retried or failed. If this param-
                     eter  is specified, then the attempts parameter must also
                     be specified.

                     (structure)
                        Specifies a set of conditions to be met, and an action
                        to take (RETRY or EXIT ) if all conditions are met.

                        onStatusReason -> (string)
                            Contains  a glob pattern to match against the Sta-
                            tusReason returned for a job. The pattern  can  be
                            up  to  512  characters  in length. It can contain
                            letters, numbers, periods  (.),  colons  (:),  and
                            white  space  (including  spaces  or tabs). It can
                            optionally end with an asterisk (*) so  that  only
                            the  start  of  the  string  needs  to be an exact
                            match.

                            The string can be between 1 and 512 characters  in
                            length.

                        onReason -> (string)
                            Contains  a glob pattern to match against the Rea-
                            son returned for a job. The pattern can be  up  to
                            512  characters in length. It can contain letters,
                            numbers, periods (.), colons (:), and white  space
                            (including spaces and tabs). It can optionally end
                            with an asterisk (*) so that only the start of the
                            string needs to be an exact match.

                            The  string can be between 1 and 512 characters in
                            length.

                        onExitCode -> (string)
                            Contains a glob pattern to match against the deci-
                            mal  representation of the ExitCode returned for a
                            job. The pattern can be up to  512  characters  in
                            length.  It  can  contain  only  numbers,  and can
                            optionally end with an asterisk (*) so  that  only
                            the  start  of  the  string  needs  to be an exact
                            match.

                            The string can be between 1 and 512 characters  in
                            length.

                        action -> (string)
                            Specifies  the action to take if all of the speci-
                            fied conditions (onStatusReason , onReason  ,  and
                            onExitCode  ) are met. The values aren't case sen-
                            sitive.

              containerProperties -> (structure)
                 An object with various properties specific to container-based
                 jobs.

                 image -> (string)
                     The  image  used  to  start  a  container. This string is
                     passed directly to  the  Docker  daemon.  Images  in  the
                     Docker  Hub  registry  are  available  by  default. Other
                     repositories are specified with `` repository-url  /image
                     :tag  ``  .  Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase),
                     numbers, hyphens, underscores, colons,  periods,  forward
                     slashes,  and  number  signs  are allowed. This parameter
                     maps to Image in the Create a container  section  of  the
                     Docker Remote API and the IMAGE parameter of docker run .

                     NOTE:
                        Docker image architecture  must  match  the  processor
                        architecture  of  the  compute  resources that they're
                        scheduled on. For example, ARM-based Docker images can
                        only run on ARM-based compute resources.

                     o Images in Amazon ECR repositories use the full registry
                       and      repository       URI       (for       example,
                       012345678910.dkr.ecr.<region-name>.amazon-
                       aws.com/<repository-name> ).

                     o Images in official repositories on  Docker  Hub  use  a
                       single name (for example, ubuntu or mongo ).

                     o Images  in  other repositories on Docker Hub are quali-
                       fied with  an  organization  name  (for  example,  ama-
                       zon/amazon-ecs-agent ).

                     o Images  in other online repositories are qualified fur-
                       ther by a domain name (for  example,  quay.io/assembly-
                       line/ubuntu ).

                 vcpus -> (integer)
                     This parameter is deprecated, use resourceRequirements to
                     specify the vCPU requirements  for  the  job  definition.
                     It's   not   supported  for  jobs  that  run  on  Fargate
                     resources. For jobs run on EC2  resources,  it  specifies
                     the number of vCPUs reserved for the job.

                     Each vCPU is equivalent to 1,024 CPU shares. This parame-
                     ter maps to CpuShares in the Create a  container  section
                     of  the  Docker Remote API and the --cpu-shares option to
                     docker run . The number of vCPUs must  be  specified  but
                     can  be  specified in several places. You must specify it
                     at least once for each node.

                 memory -> (integer)
                     This parameter is deprecated, use resourceRequirements to
                     specify  the  memory requirements for the job definition.
                     It's  not  supported  for  jobs  that  run   on   Fargate
                     resources.  For  jobs  run on EC2 resources, it specifies
                     the memory hard limit (in MiB) for a container.  If  your
                     container  attempts  to exceed the specified number, it's
                     terminated. You must specify at least 4 MiB of memory for
                     a  job using this parameter. The memory hard limit can be
                     specified in several places. It  must  be  specified  for
                     each node at least once.

                 command -> (list)
                     The  command that's passed to the container. This parame-
                     ter maps to Cmd in the Create a container section of  the
                     Docker Remote API and the COMMAND parameter to docker run
                     .        For        more         information,         see
                     https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd .

                     (string)

                 jobRoleArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that the
                     container can assume for Amazon Web Services permissions.
                     For more information, see IAM Roles for Tasks in the Ama-
                     zon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

                 executionRoleArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the execution role that
                     Batch can assume. For jobs that run on Fargate resources,
                     you must provide an execution role. For more information,
                     see Batch execution IAM role in the Batch User Guide .

                 volumes -> (list)
                     A list of data volumes used in a job.

                     (structure)
                        A data volume used in a job's container properties.

                        host -> (structure)
                            The  contents  of  the  host  parameter  determine
                            whether your data volume persists on the host con-
                            tainer  instance  and  where  it is stored. If the
                            host parameter is empty, then  the  Docker  daemon
                            assigns a host path for your data volume. However,
                            the data isn't guaranteed  to  persist  after  the
                            containers associated with it stop running.

                            NOTE:
                               This  parameter  isn't  applicable to jobs that
                               are running on Fargate resources and  shouldn't
                               be provided.

                            sourcePath -> (string)
                               The  path on the host container instance that's
                               presented to the container. If  this  parameter
                               is empty, then the Docker daemon has assigned a
                               host path for you. If this parameter contains a
                               file location, then the data volume persists at
                               the specified location on  the  host  container
                               instance  until  you delete it manually. If the
                               source path location doesn't exist on the  host
                               container  instance,  the Docker daemon creates
                               it. If the location does exist, the contents of
                               the source path folder are exported.

                               NOTE:
                                   This  parameter  isn't  applicable  to jobs
                                   that run on Fargate resources and shouldn't
                                   be provided.

                        name -> (string)
                            The  name  of the volume. It can be up to 255 let-
                            ters long. It can contain uppercase and  lowercase
                            letters,  numbers,  hyphens  (-),  and underscores
                            (_). This name is referenced in  the  sourceVolume
                            parameter of container definition mountPoints .

                        efsVolumeConfiguration -> (structure)
                            This  parameter is specified when you are using an
                            Amazon Elastic File System  file  system  for  job
                            storage.   Jobs   that   are  running  on  Fargate
                            resources must specify  a  platformVersion  of  at
                            least 1.4.0 .

                            fileSystemId -> (string)

                               If  this  parameter is omitted, the root of the
                               Amazon EFS volume is used instead. Specifying /
                               has the same effect as omitting this parameter.
                               The maximum length is 4,096 characters.

                               WARNING:
                                   If an EFS access point is specified in  the

                            values  must  be  one  of the values supported for
                            that memory value.

                            The  number  of  vCPUs reserved for the container.
                            This parameter maps to CpuShares in the  Create  a

                            --cpu-shares option to docker run . Each  vCPU  is
                            equivalent to 1,024 CPU shares. For EC2 resources,
                            you must  specify  at  least  one  vCPU.  This  is
                            required  but  can be specified in several places;
                            it must be specified for each node at least  once.

                            then value must match one of the supported  values
                            and  the  MEMORY  values must be one of the values
                            supported for that VCPU value. The supported  val-
                            ues are 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4

                        type -> (string)
                            The type of resource to assign to a container. The
                            supported resources include GPU  ,  MEMORY  ,  and
                            VCPU .

                 linuxParameters -> (structure)
                     Linux-specific modifications that are applied to the con-

                     devices -> (list)
                        Any host devices to  expose  to  the  container.  This
                        parameter  maps  to  Devices in the Create a container
                        section of the Docker  Remote  API  and  the  --device
                        option to docker run .

                        NOTE:
                            This  parameter  isn't applicable to jobs that are
                            running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be pro-
                            vided.

                        (structure)
                            An  object  representing a container instance host
                            device.

                            NOTE:
                               This object isn't applicable to jobs  that  are

                               provided.

                            hostPath -> (string)
                               The path for the device on the  host  container
                               instance.

                            containerPath -> (string)
                               The  path  inside  the container that's used to
                               expose the host device. By default,  the  host-
                               Path value is used.

                            permissions -> (list)
                               The explicit permissions to provide to the con-
                               tainer for the device.  By  default,  the  con-
                               tainer  has  permissions for read , write , and
                               mknod for the device.

                               (string)

                     initProcessEnabled -> (boolean)
                        If true, run an init process inside the container that
                        forwards  signals  and reaps processes. This parameter
                        maps to the --init option to docker run . This parame-
                        ter  requires version 1.25 of the Docker Remote API or
                        greater on  your  container  instance.  To  check  the
                        Docker  Remote API version on your container instance,
                        log into your container instance and run the following
                        command:  sudo  docker version | grep "Server API ver-
                        sion"

                     sharedMemorySize -> (integer)
                        The value for the size (in MiB) of the  /dev/shm  vol-
                        ume.  This  parameter maps to the --shm-size option to
                        docker run .

                        NOTE:

                            vided.

                     tmpfs -> (list)
                        The container path, mount options, and size  (in  MiB)
                        of the tmpfs mount. This parameter maps to the --tmpfs
                        option to docker run .

                        NOTE:
                            This parameter isn't applicable to jobs  that  are

                            size -> (integer)
                               The size (in MiB) of the tmpfs volume.

                            mountOptions -> (list)
                               The list of tmpfs volume mount options.

                               Valid  values:  "defaults  "  | "ro " | "rw " |

                               (string)

                     maxSwap -> (integer)
                        The  total  amount of swap memory (in MiB) a container
                        can use. This parameter is translated  to  the  --mem-
                        ory-swap  option  to docker run where the value is the
                        sum of the container memory plus  the  maxSwap  value.
                        For  more  information, see ` --memory-swap details <-
                        https://docs.docker.com/config/contain-
                        ers/resource_constraints/#--memory-swap-details>`__ in
                        the Docker documentation.

                        If a maxSwap value of 0 is  specified,  the  container
                        doesn't  use  swap. Accepted values are 0 or any posi-
                        tive integer. If the maxSwap parameter is omitted, the
                        container  doesn't  use the swap configuration for the
                        container instance it is running on. A  maxSwap  value
                        must be set for the swappiness parameter to be used.

                        NOTE:
                            This  parameter  isn't applicable to jobs that are
                            running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be pro-
                            vided.

                     swappiness -> (integer)
                        This  allows  you to tune a container's memory swappi-
                        ness behavior. A swappiness value of 0 causes swapping
                        not  to  happen unless absolutely necessary. A swappi-
                        ness value of 100 causes  pages  to  be  swapped  very
                        aggressively.   Accepted   values  are  whole  numbers
                        between 0 and 100 . If the swappiness parameter  isn't
                        specified,  a  default value of 60 is used. If a value
                        isn't specified for maxSwap , then this  parameter  is
                        ignored. If maxSwap is set to 0, the container doesn't
                        use swap. This parameter maps to the  --memory-swappi-
                        ness option to docker run .

                        Consider  the  following  when you use a per-container
                        swap configuration.

                        o Swap space must be enabled and allocated on the con-
                          tainer instance for the containers to use.

                        NOTE:
                            The  Amazon  ECS  optimized  AMIs  don't have swap
                            enabled by default. You must enable  swap  on  the
                            instance  to  use  this feature. For more informa-
                            tion, see Instance Store Swap Volumes in the  Ama-
                            zon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances or How do I
                            allocate memory to work as swap space in an Amazon
                            EC2 instance by using a swap file?

                        o The swap space parameters are only supported for job
                          definitions using EC2 resources.

                        o If the maxSwap and swappiness parameters are omitted
                          from  a  job  definition, each container will have a
                          default swappiness value of 60, and the  total  swap
                          usage will be limited to two times the memory reser-
                          vation of the container.

                        NOTE:
                            This parameter isn't applicable to jobs  that  are
                            running on Fargate resources and shouldn't be pro-
                            vided.

                 logConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The log configuration specification for the container.

                     This parameter maps to LogConfig in  the  Create  a  con-
                     tainer   section   of  the  Docker  Remote  API  and  the
                     --log-driver option to docker run . By default,  contain-
                     ers  use  the  same logging driver that the Docker daemon
                     uses. However the container might use a different logging
                     driver  than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver
                     with this parameter in the container definition. To use a
                     different  logging driver for a container, the log system
                     must be configured properly on the container instance (or
                     on  a  different  log server for remote logging options).
                     For more information on the options  for  different  sup-
                     ported  log drivers, see Configure logging drivers in the
                     Docker documentation.

                     NOTE:
                        Batch currently supports a subset of the logging driv-
                        ers available to the Docker daemon (shown in the  Log-
                        Configuration data type).

                     This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote
                     API  or  greater on your container instance. To check the
                     Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log
                     into  your  container instance and run the following com-
                     mand: sudo docker version | grep "Server API version"

                     NOTE:
                        The Amazon ECS container agent running on a  container
                        instance  must  register the logging drivers available
                        on that instance with the  ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIV-
                        ERS  environment  variable before containers placed on
                        that instance can use these log configuration options.

                     logDriver -> (string)
                        The  log  driver  to  use for the container. The valid
                        values listed for this parameter are log drivers  that
                        the Amazon ECS container agent can communicate with by
                        default.

                        The supported log drivers are awslogs , fluentd , gelf
                        ,  json-file  ,  journald  , logentries , syslog , and
                        splunk .

                        NOTE:
                            Jobs that are running  on  Fargate  resources  are
                            restricted  to the awslogs and splunk log drivers.

                            awslogs

                        NOTE:
                            If you have a custom driver that's not listed ear-
                            lier  that  you  want  to work with the Amazon ECS
                            container agent, you can fork the Amazon ECS  con-
                            tainer  agent  project  that's available on GitHub
                            and customize it to  work  with  that  driver.  We
                            encourage  you to submit pull requests for changes
                            that you want to have  included.  However,  Amazon
                            Web  Services  doesn't  currently  support running
                            modified copies of this software.

                        This parameter requires version  1.18  of  the  Docker
                        Remote  API  or greater on your container instance. To
                        check the Docker Remote API version on your  container
                        instance, log into your container instance and run the
                        following command: sudo docker version | grep  "Server
                        API version"

                     options -> (map)
                        The  configuration  options to send to the log driver.
                        This parameter requires version  1.19  of  the  Docker
                        Remote  API  or greater on your container instance. To
                        check the Docker Remote API version on your  container
                        instance, log into your container instance and run the
                        following command: sudo docker version | grep  "Server
                        API version"

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (string)

                     secretOptions -> (list)
                        The secrets to pass to the log configuration. For more

                                   then  you  can  use  either the full ARN or
                                   name of the  parameter.  If  the  parameter
                                   exists in a different Region, then the full
                                   ARN must be specified.

                 secrets -> (list)
                     The secrets for the container. For more information,  see
                     Specifying sensitive data in the Batch User Guide .

                     (structure)
                        An  object  representing  the secret to expose to your
                        container. Secrets can be exposed to  a  container  in

                          figuration of a  container,  use  the  secretOptions
                          container definition parameter.

                        For more information, see Specifying sensitive data in
                        the Batch User Guide .

                        name -> (string)
                            The name of the secret.

                        valueFrom -> (string)
                            The secret to expose to the  container.  The  sup-
                            ported  values  are  either  the  full  ARN of the
                            Secrets Manager secret or  the  full  ARN  of  the
                            parameter  in the Amazon Web Services Systems Man-
                            ager Parameter Store.

                            NOTE:
                               If the  Amazon  Web  Services  Systems  Manager
                               Parameter  Store  parameter  exists in the same
                               Region as the job you're  launching,  then  you
                               can  use  either  the  full  ARN or name of the
                               parameter. If the parameter exists in a differ-
                               ent  Region,  then  the full ARN must be speci-
                               fied.

                 networkConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The network configuration for jobs that  are  running  on
                     Fargate resources. Jobs that are running on EC2 resources
                     must not specify this parameter.

                     assignPublicIp -> (string)
                        Indicates whether the job  should  have  a  public  IP
                        address.   For  a  job  that  is  running  on  Fargate
                        resources in a private subnet to send outbound traffic
                        to  the  internet  (for  example,  to  pull  container
                        images), the private subnet requires a NAT gateway  be
                        attached  to  route requests to the internet. For more
                        information, see Amazon  ECS  task  networking  .  The
                        default value is "DISABLED".

                     The  platform  configuration for jobs that are running on
                     Fargate resources. Jobs that are running on EC2 resources
                     must not specify this parameter.

                     platformVersion -> (string)
                        The  Fargate  platform version where the jobs are run-
                        ning. A platform version is specified  only  for  jobs
                        that  are  running  on Fargate resources. If one isn't
                        specified, the LATEST  platform  version  is  used  by
                        default.  This  uses a recent, approved version of the
                        Fargate  platform  for  compute  resources.  For  more
                        information, see Fargate platform versions in the Ama-
                        zon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

              timeout -> (structure)
                 The timeout configuration for jobs that  are  submitted  with
                 this job definition. You can specify a timeout duration after
                 which Batch terminates your jobs if they haven't finished.

                 attemptDurationSeconds -> (integer)
                     The time duration  in  seconds  (measured  from  the  job
                     attempt's  startedAt  timestamp) after which Batch termi-
                     nates your jobs if they have not  finished.  The  minimum
                     value for the timeout is 60 seconds.

              nodeProperties -> (structure)
                 An object with various properties specific to multi-node par-
                 allel jobs.

                 NOTE:
                     If the job runs on Fargate resources, then you  must  not
                     specify nodeProperties ; use containerProperties instead.

                 numNodes -> (integer)
                     The number of nodes associated with a multi-node parallel
                     job.

                 mainNode -> (integer)
                     Specifies   the  node  index  for  the  main  node  of  a
                     multi-node parallel job. This node index  value  must  be
                     fewer than the number of nodes.

                 nodeRangeProperties -> (list)
                     A  list  of  node  ranges and their properties associated
                     with a multi-node parallel job.

                     (structure)
                        An object representing  the  properties  of  the  node
                        range for a multi-node parallel job.

                        targetNodes -> (string)
                            The  range  of  nodes,  using node index values. A
                            range of 0:3 indicates nodes with index values  of
                            0 through 3 . If the starting range value is omit-
                            ted (:n ), then 0 is used to start the  range.  If
                            the  ending range value is omitted (n: ), then the
                            highest possible node index is  used  to  end  the
                            range.  Your accumulative node ranges must account
                            for all nodes (0:n ). You can  nest  node  ranges,
                            for  example  0:10 and 4:5 , in which case the 4:5
                            range properties override the 0:10 properties.

                        container -> (structure)
                            The container details for the node range.

                            image -> (string)
                               The image  used  to  start  a  container.  This
                               string is passed directly to the Docker daemon.
                               Images in the Docker Hub registry are available
                               by  default.  Other  repositories are specified
                               with `` repository-url /image :tag `` .  Up  to
                               255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers,
                               hyphens, underscores, colons, periods,  forward
                               slashes,  and  number  signs  are allowed. This
                               parameter maps to Image in the  Create  a  con-
                               tainer section of the Docker Remote API and the
                               IMAGE parameter of docker run .

                               NOTE:
                                   Docker image architecture  must  match  the
                                   processor   architecture   of  the  compute
                                   resources that they're  scheduled  on.  For
                                   example,  ARM-based  Docker images can only
                                   run on ARM-based compute resources.

                               o Images in Amazon  ECR  repositories  use  the
                                 full  registry  and repository URI (for exam-
                                 ple,  012345678910.dkr.ecr.<region-name>.ama-

                               o Images in official repositories on Docker Hub
                                 use a single name  (for  example,  ubuntu  or
                                 mongo ).

                               o Images  in  other  repositories on Docker Hub
                                 are qualified with an organization name  (for
                                 example, amazon/amazon-ecs-agent ).

                               o Images in other online repositories are qual-
                                 ified further by a domain name (for  example,
                                 quay.io/assemblyline/ubuntu ).

                            vcpus -> (integer)
                               This     parameter     is    deprecated,    use
                               resourceRequirements  to   specify   the   vCPU
                               requirements  for  the job definition. It's not
                               supported  for  jobs  that   run   on   Fargate
                               resources.  For  jobs  run on EC2 resources, it
                               specifies the number of vCPUs reserved for  the
                               job.

                               Each  vCPU  is  equivalent to 1,024 CPU shares.
                               This parameter maps to CpuShares in the  Create
                               a  container  section  of the Docker Remote API
                               and the --cpu-shares option to docker run . The
                               number  of  vCPUs  must be specified but can be
                               specified in several places. You  must  specify
                               it at least once for each node.

                            memory -> (integer)
                               This     parameter     is    deprecated,    use
                               resourceRequirements  to  specify  the   memory
                               requirements  for  the job definition. It's not
                               supported  for  jobs  that   run   on   Fargate
                               resources.  For  jobs  run on EC2 resources, it
                               specifies the memory hard limit (in MiB) for  a
                               container. If your container attempts to exceed
                               the specified number, it's terminated. You must
                               specify  at  least  4  MiB  of memory for a job
                               using this parameter. The memory hard limit can
                               be  specified  in  several  places.  It must be
                               specified for each node at least once.

                            command -> (list)
                               The command that's  passed  to  the  container.
                               This parameter maps to Cmd in the Create a con-

                            jobRoleArn -> (string)
                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM  role
                               that  the  container  can assume for Amazon Web
                               Services permissions. For more information, see

                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the execution
                               role  that  Batch can assume. For jobs that run
                               on Fargate resources, you must provide an  exe-

                               execution IAM role in the Batch User Guide .

                            volumes -> (list)
                               A list of data volumes used in a job.

                               (structure)
                                   A data volume used  in  a  job's  container
                                   properties.

                                   host -> (structure)
                                      The   contents  of  the  host  parameter
                                      determine whether your data volume  per-
                                      sists on the host container instance and
                                      where it is stored. If the host  parame-
                                      ter  is  empty,  then  the Docker daemon
                                      assigns a host path for your  data  vol-
                                      ume.  However, the data isn't guaranteed
                                      to persist after the containers  associ-
                                      ated with it stop running.

                                      NOTE:
                                          This  parameter  isn't applicable to
                                          jobs that  are  running  on  Fargate
                                          resources and shouldn't be provided.

                                      sourcePath -> (string)
                                          The  path  on  the  host   container
                                          instance  that's  presented  to  the
                                          container.  If  this  parameter   is
                                          empty,  then  the  Docker daemon has
                                          assigned a host  path  for  you.  If
                                          this parameter contains a file loca-
                                          tion, then the data volume  persists
                                          at  the  specified  location  on the
                                          host container  instance  until  you
                                          delete  it  manually.  If the source
                                          path location doesn't exist  on  the
                                          host  container instance, the Docker
                                          daemon creates it. If  the  location
                                          does  exist,  the  contents  of  the
                                          source path folder are exported.

                                          NOTE:
                                             This parameter  isn't  applicable
                                             to   jobs  that  run  on  Fargate
                                             resources and shouldn't  be  pro-
                                             vided.

                                   name -> (string)
                                      The  name of the volume. It can be up to
                                      255 letters long. It can contain  upper-
                                      case  and  lowercase  letters,  numbers,
                                      hyphens (-), and underscores  (_).  This
                                      name  is  referenced in the sourceVolume

                                      This parameter is specified when you are
                                      using an Amazon Elastic File System file
                                      system  for  job  storage. Jobs that are
                                      running on Fargate resources must  spec-

                                   If a maxSwap value of 0 is  specified,  the
                                   container doesn't use swap. Accepted values
                                   are 0  or  any  positive  integer.  If  the
                                   maxSwap parameter is omitted, the container
                                   doesn't use the swap configuration for  the
                                   container  instance  it  is  running  on. A
                                   maxSwap value must be set for  the  swappi-
                                   ness parameter to be used.

                                   NOTE:
                                      This  parameter isn't applicable to jobs
                                      that are running  on  Fargate  resources
                                      and shouldn't be provided.

                               swappiness -> (integer)
                                   This  allows you to tune a container's mem-
                                   ory swappiness behavior. A swappiness value
                                   of  0  causes swapping not to happen unless
                                   absolutely necessary. A swappiness value of
                                   100 causes pages to be swapped very aggres-
                                   sively. Accepted values are  whole  numbers
                                   between  0  and  100  .  If  the swappiness
                                   parameter isn't specified, a default  value
                                   of  60  is used. If a value isn't specified
                                   for  maxSwap  ,  then  this  parameter   is
                                   ignored.  If  maxSwap is set to 0, the con-
                                   tainer doesn't  use  swap.  This  parameter
                                   maps  to  the --memory-swappiness option to
                                   docker run .

                                   Consider  the  following  when  you  use  a
                                   per-container swap configuration.

                                   o Swap  space must be enabled and allocated
                                     on the container instance  for  the  con-
                                     tainers to use.

                                   NOTE:
                                      The Amazon ECS optimized AMIs don't have
                                      swap enabled by default. You must enable
                                      swap  on  the  instance to use this fea-
                                      ture. For more information, see Instance

                                      swap file?

                                   o The  swap  space parameters are only sup-
                                     ported  for  job  definitions  using  EC2
                                     resources.

                                   o If  the maxSwap and swappiness parameters
                                     are omitted from a job  definition,  each
                                     container  will have a default swappiness
                                     value of 60, and  the  total  swap  usage
                                     will  be  limited to two times the memory
                                     reservation of the container.

                                   NOTE:
                                      This parameter isn't applicable to  jobs

                               The log  configuration  specification  for  the
                               container.

                               This  parameter maps to LogConfig in the Create

                               and  the --log-driver option to docker run . By
                               default, containers use the same logging driver
                               that  the  Docker daemon uses. However the con-
                               tainer might use  a  different  logging  driver
                               than  the  Docker  daemon  by  specifying a log
                               driver with this  parameter  in  the  container
                               definition.  To  use a different logging driver
                               for a container, the log system must be config-
                               ured  properly on the container instance (or on
                               a  different  log  server  for  remote  logging
                               options).  For  more information on the options

                               This  parameter  requires  version  1.18 of the
                               Docker Remote API or greater on your  container

                                      If  you  have a custom driver that's not
                                      listed earlier that  you  want  to  work
                                      with the Amazon ECS container agent, you
                                      can fork the Amazon ECS container  agent
                                      project  that's  available on GitHub and
                                      customize it to work with  that  driver.

                               platformVersion -> (string)
                                   The Fargate platform version where the jobs
                                   are  running.  A platform version is speci-
                                   fied only for jobs that are running on Far-
                                   gate resources. If one isn't specified, the
                                   LATEST platform version is used by default.
                                   This uses a recent, approved version of the
                                   Fargate platform for compute resources. For

                 value -> (string)

              propagateTags -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether  to propagate the tags from the job or job
                 definition to the corresponding Amazon ECS task. If no  value
                 is  specified,  the  tags aren't propagated. Tags can only be
                 propagated to the tasks during task creation. For  tags  with
                 the  same  name, job tags are given priority over job defini-
                 tions tags. If the total number of combined tags from the job
                 and job definition is over 50, the job is moved to the FAILED
                 state.

              platformCapabilities -> (list)
                 The platform capabilities required by the job definition.  If
                 no  value is specified, it defaults to EC2 . Jobs run on Far-
                 gate resources specify FARGATE .

                 (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken value to include in  a  future  DescribeJobDefinitions
          request. When the results of a DescribeJobDefinitions request exceed
          maxResults , this value can be used to retrieve  the  next  page  of
          results.  This  value  is  null  when  there  are no more results to
          return.
