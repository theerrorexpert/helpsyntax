DELETE-COMPUTE-ENVIRONMENT()                      DELETE-COMPUTE-ENVIRONMENT()



NAME
       delete-compute-environment -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes an Batch compute environment.

       Before  you can delete a compute environment, you must set its state to
       DISABLED with the  UpdateComputeEnvironment API operation and  disasso-
       ciate  it  from  any job queues with the  UpdateJobQueue API operation.
       Compute environments that use  Fargate  resources  must  terminate  all
       active  jobs  on  that  compute environment before deleting the compute
       environment. If this isn't done,  the  compute  environment  enters  an
       invalid state.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-compute-environment
          --compute-environment <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --compute-environment (string)
          The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the compute environment to
          delete.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
