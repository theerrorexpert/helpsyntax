DESCRIBE-JOB-QUEUES()                                    DESCRIBE-JOB-QUEUES()



NAME
       describe-job-queues -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes one or more of your job queues.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-job-queues is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: jobQueues

SYNOPSIS
            describe-job-queues
          [--job-queues <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-queues (list)
          A list of up to 100 queue names or full queue Amazon  Resource  Name
          (ARN) entries.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe a job queue

       This example describes the HighPriority job queue.

       Command:

          aws batch describe-job-queues --job-queues HighPriority

       Output:

          {
              "jobQueues": [
                  {
                      "status": "VALID",
                      "jobQueueArn": "arn:aws:batch:us-east-1:012345678910:job-queue/HighPriority",
                      "computeEnvironmentOrder": [
                          {
                              "computeEnvironment": "arn:aws:batch:us-east-1:012345678910:compute-environment/C4OnDemand",
                              "order": 1
                          }
                      ],
                      "statusReason": "JobQueue Healthy",
                      "priority": 1,
                      "state": "ENABLED",
                      "jobQueueName": "HighPriority"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       jobQueues -> (list)
          The list of job queues.

          (structure)
              An object representing the details of an Batch job queue.

              jobQueueName -> (string)
                 The name of the job queue.

              jobQueueArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job queue.

              state -> (string)
                 Describes the ability of the queue to accept new jobs. If the
                 job queue state is ENABLED , it's able to accept jobs. If the
                 job queue state is DISABLED , new jobs can't be added to  the
                 queue, but jobs already in the queue can finish.

              schedulingPolicyArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the scheduling policy. The
                 format is aws:*Partition* :batch:*Region* :*Account*  :sched-
                 uling-policy/*Name*       ``       .       For       example,
                 ``aws:aws:batch:us-west-2:012345678910:scheduling-pol-
                 icy/MySchedulingPolicy .

              status -> (string)
                 The  status  of the job queue (for example, CREATING or VALID
                 ).

              statusReason -> (string)
                 A short, human-readable string to provide additional  details
                 about the current status of the job queue.

              priority -> (integer)
                 The  priority of the job queue. Job queues with a higher pri-
                 ority (or a higher integer value for the priority  parameter)
                 are  evaluated  first  when  associated with the same compute
                 environment. Priority is determined in descending order,  for
                 example,  a  job  queue  with a priority value of 10 is given
                 scheduling preference over a job queue with a priority  value
                 of  1  .  All  of the compute environments must be either EC2
                 (EC2 or SPOT ) or Fargate (FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT ); EC2 and
                 Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.

              computeEnvironmentOrder -> (list)
                 The  compute  environments that are attached to the job queue
                 and the order that job placement is preferred. Compute  envi-
                 ronments are selected for job placement in ascending order.

                 (structure)
                     The order in which compute environments are tried for job
                     placement within a queue. Compute environments are  tried
                     in  ascending order. For example, if two compute environ-
                     ments are associated with a job queue, the compute  envi-
                     ronment with a lower order integer value is tried for job
                     placement first. Compute  environments  must  be  in  the
                     VALID  state  before  you  can  associate them with a job
                     queue. All of the compute environments must be either EC2
                     (EC2 or SPOT ) or Fargate (FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT ); EC2
                     and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.

                     NOTE:
                        All compute environments that are  associated  with  a
                        job  queue  must  share  the  same architecture. Batch
                        doesn't support mixing compute  environment  architec-
                        ture types in a single job queue.

                     order -> (integer)
                        The order of the compute environment. Compute environ-
                        ments are tried in ascending order.  For  example,  if
                        two  compute  environments  are  associated with a job
                        queue, the compute  environment  with  a  lower  order
                        integer value is tried for job placement first.

                     computeEnvironment -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the compute environ-
                        ment.

              tags -> (map)
                 The tags applied to the job queue. For more information,  see
                 Tagging your Batch resources in Batch User Guide .

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  nextToken  value  to  include  in  a  future  DescribeJobQueues
          request. When the results  of  a  DescribeJobQueues  request  exceed
          maxResults  ,  this  value  can be used to retrieve the next page of
          results. This value is null  when  there  are  no  more  results  to
          return.
