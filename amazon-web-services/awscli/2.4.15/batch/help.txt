NAME
       batch -

DESCRIPTION
       Using  Batch,  you  can run batch computing workloads on the Amazon Web
       Services Cloud. Batch computing is a common means for developers,  sci-
       entists,  and  engineers  to access large amounts of compute resources.
       Batch uses the advantages of this  computing  workload  to  remove  the
       undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing required in-
       frastructure. At the same time, it also adopts a familiar batch comput-
       ing  software  approach.  Given these advantages, Batch can help you to
       efficiently provision resources in response  to  jobs  submitted,  thus
       effectively  helping you to eliminate capacity constraints, reduce com-
       pute costs, and deliver your results more quickly.

       As a fully managed service, Batch can run batch computing workloads  of
       any  scale.  Batch automatically provisions compute resources and opti-
       mizes workload distribution based on the quantity  and  scale  of  your
       specific  workloads.  With  Batch, there's no need to install or manage
       batch computing software. This means that you can focus your  time  and
       energy on analyzing results and solving your specific problems.
