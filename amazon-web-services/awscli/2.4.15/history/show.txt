SHOW()                                                                  SHOW()



NAME
       show -

DESCRIPTION
       Shows  the various events related to running a specific CLI command. If
       this command is ran without any positional arguments, it  will  display
       the events for the last CLI command ran.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            show
          command_id <value>
          [--include <value> [<value>...]]
          [--exclude <value> [<value>...]]
          [--format <value>]

OPTIONS
       command_id  (string)  The  ID of the CLI command to show. If this posi-
       tional argument is omitted, it will show the last the CLI command  ran.

       --include  (string) Specifies which events to only include when showing
       the CLI command. This argument is mutually exclusive with --exclude.

       --exclude (string) Specifies which events to exclude when  showing  the
       CLI command. This argument is mutually exclusive with --include.

       --format  (string)  Specifies which format to use in showing the events
       for the specified CLI command. The following formats are supported:

          o detailed - This the default format. It prints out a detailed over-
            view  of the CLI command ran. It displays all of the key events in
            the command lifecycle where each important event has a  title  and
            its  important  values underneath. The events are ordered by time-
            stamp and events of the same API call are associated together with
            the  [api_id]  notation  where  events  that share the same api_id
            belong to the lifecycle of the same API call.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
