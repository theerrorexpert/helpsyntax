DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides simple, scalable file
       storage for use with Amazon EC2 Linux and Mac instances in  the  Amazon
       Web Services Cloud. With Amazon EFS, storage capacity is elastic, grow-
       ing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove  files,  so  your
       applications  have  the  storage they need, when they need it. For more
       information, see the Amazon Elastic File System API Reference  and  the
       Amazon Elastic File System User Guide .
