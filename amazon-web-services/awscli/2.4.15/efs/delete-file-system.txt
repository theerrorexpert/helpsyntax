DELETE-FILE-SYSTEM()                                      DELETE-FILE-SYSTEM()



NAME
       delete-file-system -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  file  system,  permanently severing access to its contents.
       Upon return, the file system no longer exists and you can't access  any
       contents of the deleted file system.

       You  can't  delete  a  file system that is in use. That is, if the file
       system has any mount targets, you must  first  delete  them.  For  more
       information, see  DescribeMountTargets and  DeleteMountTarget .

       NOTE:
          The  DeleteFileSystem  call  returns  while the file system state is
          still deleting . You can check the file system  deletion  status  by
          calling  the  DescribeFileSystems operation, which returns a list of
          file systems in your account. If you pass file system ID or creation
          token  for the deleted file system, the  DescribeFileSystems returns
          a 404 FileSystemNotFound error.

       This operation requires permissions for  the  elasticfilesystem:Delete-
       FileSystem action.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-file-system
          --file-system-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --file-system-id (string)
          The ID of the file system you want to delete.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
