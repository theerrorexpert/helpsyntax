DESCRIBE-ACCESS-POINTS()                              DESCRIBE-ACCESS-POINTS()



NAME
       describe-access-points -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  description  of a specific Amazon EFS access point if the
       AccessPointId is provided. If you provide  an  EFS  FileSystemId  ,  it
       returns descriptions of all access points for that file system. You can
       provide either an AccessPointId or a FileSystemId in the  request,  but
       not both.

       This   operation   requires   permissions   for   the   elasticfilesys-
       tem:DescribeAccessPoints action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-access-points
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--access-point-id <value>]
          [--file-system-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          (Optional) When retrieving all access points for a file system,  you
          can optionally specify the MaxItems parameter to limit the number of
          objects returned in a response. The default value is 100.

       --next-token (string)
          NextToken is present if the  response  is  paginated.  You  can  use
          NextMarker  in  the  subsequent  request  to  fetch the next page of
          access point descriptions.

       --access-point-id (string)
          (Optional)  Specifies  an  EFS  access  point  to  describe  in  the
          response; mutually exclusive with FileSystemId .

       --file-system-id (string)
          (Optional)  If  you  provide a FileSystemId , EFS returns all access
          points for that file system; mutually exclusive with AccessPointId .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 file operations by NFS clients using the access point.

                 Uid -> (long)
                     The  POSIX  user  ID  used for all file system operations
                     using this access point.

                     Secondary POSIX group IDs used for all file system opera-
                     tions using this access point.

                     (long)

              RootDirectory -> (structure)
                 The directory on the Amazon EFS file system that  the  access
                 point  exposes as the root directory to NFS clients using the
                 access point.

                 Path -> (string)
                     Specifies the path on the EFS file system  to  expose  as
                     the  root directory to NFS clients using the access point
                     to access the EFS file system. A path can have up to four
                     subdirectories. If the specified path does not exist, you
                     are required to provide the CreationInfo .

                 CreationInfo -> (structure)
                     (Optional) Specifies the POSIX  IDs  and  permissions  to

                     Directory > Path specified does not  exist,  EFS  creates
                     the root directory using the CreationInfo settings when a
                     client connects to an access point. When  specifying  the
                     CreationInfo  ,  you  must provide values for all proper-
                     ties.

                     WARNING:
                        If you do not provide CreationInfo and  the  specified
                        RootDirectory > Path does not exist, attempts to mount
                        the file system using the access point will fail.

                     OwnerUid -> (long)
                        Specifies the POSIX user ID to apply to the RootDirec-
                        tory . Accepts values from 0 to 2^32 (4294967295).

                        Directory , in the format of an  octal  number  repre-
                        senting the file's mode bits.

              OwnerId -> (string)
                 Identified  the  Amazon  Web  Services  account that owns the
                 access point resource.

              LifeCycleState -> (string)
                 Identifies the lifecycle phase of the access point.

       NextToken -> (string)
