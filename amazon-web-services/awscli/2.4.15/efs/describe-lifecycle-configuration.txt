NAME
       describe-lifecycle-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  current  LifecycleConfiguration  object for the specified
       Amazon EFS file system. EFS lifecycle management uses the LifecycleCon-
       figuration object to identify which files to move to the EFS Infrequent
       Access (IA) storage class. For a file system without a LifecycleConfig-
       uration object, the call returns an empty array in the response.

       When  EFS  Intelligent  Tiering is enabled, TransitionToPrimaryStorage-
       Class has a value of AFTER_1_ACCESS .

       This   operation   requires   permissions   for   the   elasticfilesys-
       tem:DescribeLifecycleConfiguration operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-lifecycle-configuration
          --file-system-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --file-system-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the file system whose LifecycleConfiguration object you
          want to retrieve (String).

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LifecyclePolicies -> (list)
          An array of lifecycle management policies. EFS supports a maximum of
          one policy per file system.

          (structure)
              Describes  a  policy  used  by  EFS lifecycle management and EFS
              intelligent tiering that specifies when to transition files into
              and  out  of  the  file  system's Infrequent Access (IA) storage
              class. For more information, see EFS IntelligentTiering and  EFS
              Lifecycle Management .

              NOTE:
                 When using the put-lifecycle-configuration CLI command or the
                 PutLifecycleConfiguration API  action,  Amazon  EFS  requires
                 that  each  LifecyclePolicy object have only a single transi-
                 tion. This means that in a  request  body,  LifecyclePolicies
                 needs  to  be  structured  as  an  array  of  LifecyclePolicy
                 objects, one object for  each  transition,  TransitionToIA  ,
                 TransitionToPrimaryStorageClass  .  For more information, see
                 the request examples in  PutLifecycleConfiguration .

              TransitionToIA -> (string)
                 Describes the period of time that a  file  is  not  accessed,
                 after which it transitions to IA storage. Metadata operations
                 such as listing the contents of a directory  don't  count  as
                 file access events.

              TransitionToPrimaryStorageClass -> (string)
                 Describes  when  to transition a file from IA storage to pri-
                 mary storage. Metadata operations such as  listing  the  con-
                 tents of a directory don't count as file access events.
