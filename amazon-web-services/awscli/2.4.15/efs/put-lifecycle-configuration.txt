PUT-LIFECYCLE-CONFIGURATION()                    PUT-LIFECYCLE-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       put-lifecycle-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Enables  lifecycle  management by creating a new LifecycleConfiguration
       object. A LifecycleConfiguration object defines when files in an Amazon
       EFS  file  system  are automatically transitioned to the lower-cost EFS
       Infrequent Access (IA) storage class. To enable EFS  Intelligent  Tier-
       ing, set the value of TransitionToPrimaryStorageClass to AFTER_1_ACCESS
       . For more information, see EFS Lifecycle Management .

       Each Amazon EFS file system supports one lifecycle configuration, which
       applies  to  all  files in the file system. If a LifecycleConfiguration
       object already exists for the specified file system, a PutLifecycleCon-
       figuration call modifies the existing configuration. A PutLifecycleCon-
       figuration call with an empty LifecyclePolicies array  in  the  request
       body  deletes any existing LifecycleConfiguration and turns off lifecy-
       cle management for the file system.

       In the request, specify the following:

       o The ID for the file system for which you are enabling, disabling,  or
         modifying lifecycle management.

       o A LifecyclePolicies array of LifecyclePolicy objects that define when
         files are moved to the IA storage class.  Amazon  EFS  requires  that
         each  LifecyclePolicy  object  have only have a single transition, so
         the LifecyclePolicies array needs  to  be  structured  with  separate
         LifecyclePolicy  objects.  See  the example requests in the following
         section for more information.

       This operation requires permissions for the  elasticfilesystem:PutLife-
       cycleConfiguration operation.

       To  apply  a LifecycleConfiguration object to an encrypted file system,
       you need the same Key Management Service permissions as when  you  cre-
       ated the encrypted file system.

SYNOPSIS
            put-lifecycle-configuration
          --file-system-id <value>
          --lifecycle-policies <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --file-system-id (string)
          The  ID of the file system for which you are creating the Lifecycle-
          Configuration object (String).

       --lifecycle-policies (list)
          An array of LifecyclePolicy objects that define  the  file  system's
          LifecycleConfiguration   object.   A  LifecycleConfiguration  object
          informs EFS lifecycle management and intelligent tiering of the fol-
          lowing:

          o When  to move files in the file system from primary storage to the
            IA storage class.

          o When to move files that are in IA storage to primary storage.

          NOTE:
              When using the put-lifecycle-configuration CLI  command  or  the
              PutLifecycleConfiguration  API  action, Amazon EFS requires that
              each LifecyclePolicy object have only a single transition.  This
              means  that  in  a  request  body, LifecyclePolicies needs to be
              structured as an array of LifecyclePolicy  objects,  one  object
              for  each  transition, TransitionToIA , TransitionToPrimaryStor-
              ageClass . See the example requests in the following section for
              more information.

          (structure)
              Describes  a  policy  used  by  EFS lifecycle management and EFS
              intelligent tiering that specifies when to transition files into
              and  out  of  the  file  system's Infrequent Access (IA) storage
              class. For more information, see EFS IntelligentTiering and  EFS
              Lifecycle Management .

              NOTE:
                 When using the put-lifecycle-configuration CLI command or the
                 PutLifecycleConfiguration API  action,  Amazon  EFS  requires
                 that  each  LifecyclePolicy object have only a single transi-
                 tion. This means that in a  request  body,  LifecyclePolicies
                 needs  to  be  structured  as  an  array  of  LifecyclePolicy
                 objects, one object for  each  transition,  TransitionToIA  ,
                 TransitionToPrimaryStorageClass  .  For more information, see
                 the request examples in  PutLifecycleConfiguration .

              TransitionToIA -> (string)
                 Describes the period of time that a  file  is  not  accessed,
                 after which it transitions to IA storage. Metadata operations
                 such as listing the contents of a directory  don't  count  as
                 file access events.

              TransitionToPrimaryStorageClass -> (string)
                 Describes  when  to transition a file from IA storage to pri-
                 mary storage. Metadata operations such as  listing  the  con-
                 tents of a directory don't count as file access events.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TransitionToIA=string,TransitionToPrimaryStorageClass=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "TransitionToIA": "AFTER_7_DAYS"|"AFTER_14_DAYS"|"AFTER_30_DAYS"|"AFTER_60_DAYS"|"AFTER_90_DAYS",
              "TransitionToPrimaryStorageClass": "AFTER_1_ACCESS"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LifecyclePolicies -> (list)
          An array of lifecycle management policies. EFS supports a maximum of
          one policy per file system.

          (structure)

              class.  For more information, see EFS IntelligentTiering and EFS
