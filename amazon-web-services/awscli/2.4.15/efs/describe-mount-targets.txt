DESCRIBE-MOUNT-TARGETS()                              DESCRIBE-MOUNT-TARGETS()



NAME
       describe-mount-targets -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  descriptions  of all the current mount targets, or a spe-
       cific mount target, for a file system. When requesting all of the  cur-
       rent mount targets, the order of mount targets returned in the response
       is unspecified.

       This operation requires permissions for the elasticfilesystem:Describe-
       MountTargets  action,  on either the file system ID that you specify in
       FileSystemId , or on the file system of the mount target that you spec-
       ify in MountTargetId .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-mount-targets is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: MountTargets

SYNOPSIS
            describe-mount-targets
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--file-system-id <value>]
          [--mount-target-id <value>]
          [--access-point-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --file-system-id (string)
          (Optional) ID of the file system whose mount  targets  you  want  to
          list  (String).  It  must  be included in your request if an Access-
          PointId or MountTargetId is not included. Accepts either a file sys-
          tem ID or ARN as input.

       --mount-target-id (string)
          (Optional)  ID  of  the mount target that you want to have described
          (String). It must be included in your request if FileSystemId is not
          included. Accepts either a mount target ID or ARN as input.

       --access-point-id (string)
          (Optional)  The  ID of the access point whose mount targets that you
          want to list. It must be included in your request if a  FileSystemId
          or  MountTargetId is not included in your request. Accepts either an
          access point ID or ARN as input.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe a mount target

       The  following  describe-mount-targets  example describes the specified
       mount target.

          aws efs describe-mount-targets \
              --mount-target-id fsmt-f9a14450

       Output:

                      "MountTargetId": "fsmt-f9a14450",
                      "FileSystemId": "fs-c7a0456e",
                      "SubnetId": "subnet-02bf4c428bexample",
                      "LifeCycleState": "creating",
                      "IpAddress": "10.0.1.24",
                      "NetworkInterfaceId": "eni-02d542216aexample",
                      "AvailabilityZoneId": "use2-az2",
                      "AvailabilityZoneName": "us-east-2b",
                      "VpcId": "vpc-0123456789abcdef0"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          If the request included the Marker , the response returns that value
          in this field.

       MountTargets -> (list)
          Returns the file system's mount targets as an array of  MountTarget-
          Description objects.

          (structure)
              Provides a description of a mount target.

              OwnerId -> (string)
                 Amazon Web Services account ID that owns the resource.

              MountTargetId -> (string)
                 System-assigned mount target ID.

              FileSystemId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of  the  file  system  for which the mount target is
                 intended.

              SubnetId -> (string)
                 The ID of the mount target's subnet.

              LifeCycleState -> (string)
                 Lifecycle state of the mount target.

              IpAddress -> (string)
                 Address at which the file system can be mounted by using  the
                 mount target.

              NetworkInterfaceId -> (string)
                 The  ID of the network interface that Amazon EFS created when
                 it created the mount target.

              AvailabilityZoneId -> (string)
                 The unique and consistent identifier of the Availability Zone
                 that the mount target resides in. For example, use1-az1 is an
                 AZ ID for the us-east-1 Region and it has the  same  location
                 in every Amazon Web Services account.

              AvailabilityZoneName -> (string)
                 The  name  of the Availability Zone in which the mount target
                 is located. Availability Zones are  independently  mapped  to
                 names  for each Amazon Web Services account. For example, the
                 Availability Zone us-east-1a for  your  Amazon  Web  Services
                 account  might  not  be  the  same location as us-east-1a for
                 another Amazon Web Services account.

              VpcId -> (string)
                 The virtual private cloud (VPC) ID that the mount  target  is
                 configured in.

       NextMarker -> (string)
          If  a value is present, there are more mount targets to return. In a
          subsequent request, you can provide Marker in your request with this
          value to retrieve the next set of mount targets.
