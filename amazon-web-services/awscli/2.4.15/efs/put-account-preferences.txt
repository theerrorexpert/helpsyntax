PUT-ACCOUNT-PREFERENCES()                            PUT-ACCOUNT-PREFERENCES()



NAME
       put-account-preferences -

DESCRIPTION
       Use  this operation to set the account preference in the current Amazon
       Web Services Region to use long 17 character (63 bit) or short 8  char-
       acter  (32  bit)  resource IDs for new EFS file system and mount target
       resources. All existing resource IDs are not affected  by  any  changes
       you make. You can set the ID preference during the opt-in period as EFS
       transitions to long resource IDs. For more  information,  see  Managing
       Amazon EFS resource IDs .

       NOTE:
          Starting  in  October, 2021, you will receive an error if you try to
          set the account preference to  use  the  short  8  character  format
          resource  ID.  Contact Amazon Web Services support if you receive an
          error and need to use short IDs for file  system  and  mount  target
          resources.

SYNOPSIS
            put-account-preferences
          --resource-id-type <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-id-type (string)
          Specifies  the EFS resource ID preference to set for the user's Ama-
          zon Web Services account, in the current Amazon Web Services Region,
          either LONG_ID (17 characters), or SHORT_ID (8 characters).

          NOTE:
              Starting  in  October, 2021, you will receive an error when set-
              ting the account preference to SHORT_ID  .  Contact  Amazon  Web
              Services  support  if you receive an error and need to use short
              IDs for file system and mount target resources.

          Possible values:

          o LONG_ID

          o SHORT_ID

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
