CREATE-FILE-SYSTEM()                                      CREATE-FILE-SYSTEM()



NAME
       create-file-system -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new,  empty  file system. The operation requires a creation
       token in the request that Amazon EFS uses to ensure idempotent creation
       (calling  the  operation  with same creation token has no effect). If a
       file system does not currently exist that is owned by the caller's Ama-
       zon Web Services account with the specified creation token, this opera-
       tion does the following:

       o Creates a new, empty file system. The file system will have an Amazon
         EFS assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state creating .

       o Returns with the description of the created file system.

       Otherwise,  this operation returns a FileSystemAlreadyExists error with
       the ID of the existing file system.

       NOTE:
          For basic use cases, you can use a randomly generated UUID  for  the
          creation token.

       The  idempotent  operation  allows you to retry a CreateFileSystem call
       without risk of creating an extra file system. This can happen when  an
       initial  call  fails in a way that leaves it uncertain whether or not a
       file system was actually created. An example might be that a  transport
       level timeout occurred or your connection was reset. As long as you use
       the same creation token, if the initial call had succeeded in  creating
       a  file system, the client can learn of its existence from the FileSys-
       temAlreadyExists error.

       For more information, see Creating a file system in the Amazon EFS User
       Guide .

       NOTE:
          The  CreateFileSystem call returns while the file system's lifecycle
          state is still creating . You can check  the  file  system  creation
          status  by  calling  the  DescribeFileSystems operation, which among
          other things returns the file system state.

       This operation accepts an optional PerformanceMode parameter  that  you
       choose  for  your  file system. We recommend generalPurpose performance
       mode for most file systems. File systems using  the  maxIO  performance
       mode  can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and operations
       per second with a tradeoff of slightly higher latencies for  most  file
       operations. The performance mode can't be changed after the file system
       has been created. For more  information,  see  Amazon  EFS  performance
       modes .

       You  can set the throughput mode for the file system using the Through-
       putMode parameter.

       After the file system is fully created, Amazon EFS sets  its  lifecycle
       state  to  available  , at which point you can create one or more mount
       targets for the file system in your  VPC.  For  more  information,  see
       CreateMountTarget  .  You  mount  your Amazon EFS file system on an EC2
       instances in your VPC by using the mount target. For more  information,
       see Amazon EFS: How it Works .

       This  operation  requires permissions for the elasticfilesystem:Create-
       FileSystem action.

          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --creation-token (string)
          A string of up to 64 ASCII  characters.  Amazon  EFS  uses  this  to
          ensure idempotent creation.

       --performance-mode (string)
          The performance mode of the file system. We recommend generalPurpose
          performance mode for most file systems. File systems using the maxIO
          performance  mode can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput
          and operations per second with a tradeoff of slightly higher  laten-
          cies for most file operations. The performance mode can't be changed
          after the file system has been created.

          NOTE:
              The maxIO mode is not supported on file systems using  One  Zone
              storage classes.

          Possible values:

          o generalPurpose

          o maxIO

       --encrypted | --no-encrypted (boolean)
          A  Boolean  value  that,  if true, creates an encrypted file system.
          When creating an encrypted file system, you have the option of spec-
          ifying  an  existing  Key  Management  Service key (KMS key). If you
          don't specify a KMS key, then the default KMS key  for  Amazon  EFS,
          /aws/elasticfilesystem  , is used to protect the encrypted file sys-
          tem.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The ID of the KMS key that you want to use to protect the  encrypted
          file  system.  This  parameter is only required if you want to use a
          non-default KMS key. If this parameter is not specified, the default
          KMS  key  for Amazon EFS is used. You can specify a KMS key ID using
          the following formats:

          o Key  ID  -  A  unique  identifier  of   the   key,   for   example
            1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab .

          o ARN  -  An  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) for the key, for example
            arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
            .

          o Key alias - A previously created display name for a key, for exam-
            ple alias/projectKey1 .

          o Key  alias  ARN  -  An  ARN  for  a   key   alias,   for   example
            arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:444455556666:alias/projectKey1 .

          If  you  use  KmsKeyId  ,  you  must  set  the   CreateFileSystemRe-
          quest$Encrypted parameter to true.

          WARNING:
              EFS accepts only symmetric KMS keys. You cannot  use  asymmetric
              KMS keys with Amazon EFS file systems.

       --throughput-mode (string)
          Specifies  the  throughput mode for the file system, either bursting
          or provisioned . If you set ThroughputMode to provisioned , you must
          also set a value for ProvisionedThroughputInMibps . After you create
          the file system, you can decrease your file system's  throughput  in
          Provisioned  Throughput mode or change between the throughput modes,
          as long as its been more than 24 hours since the  last  decrease  or
          throughput   mode  change.  For  more  information,  see  Specifying
          throughput with provisioned mode in the Amazon EFS User Guide .

          Default is bursting .

          Possible values:

          o bursting

          o provisioned

       --provisioned-throughput-in-mibps (double)
          The throughput, measured in MiB/s, that you want to provision for  a
          file  system that you're creating. Valid values are 1-1024. Required
          if ThroughputMode is set  to  provisioned  .  The  upper  limit  for
          throughput is 1024 MiB/s. To increase this limit, contact Amazon Web
          Services Support. For more information, see Amazon EFS  quotas  that
          you can increase in the Amazon EFS User Guide .

       --availability-zone-name (string)
          Used  to create a file system that uses One Zone storage classes. It
          specifies the Amazon Web Services Availability Zone in which to cre-
          ate the file system. Use the format us-east-1a to specify the Avail-
          ability Zone. For more information about One Zone  storage  classes,
          see Using EFS storage classes in the Amazon EFS User Guide .

          NOTE:
              One  Zone  storage classes are not available in all Availability
              Zones in Amazon Web Services Regions where Amazon EFS is  avail-
              able.

       --backup | --no-backup (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  automatic backups are enabled on the file system
          that you are creating. Set the value to  true  to  enable  automatic
          backups.  If you are creating a file system that uses One Zone stor-
          age classes, automatic backups are  enabled  by  default.  For  more
          information, see Automatic backups in the Amazon EFS User Guide .

          Default is false . However, if you specify an AvailabilityZoneName ,
          the default is true .

          NOTE:
              Backup is not available in all Amazon Web Services Regions where
              Amazon EFS is available.

       --tags (list)
          Use to create one or more tags associated with the file system. Each
          tag is a user-defined key-value pair. Name your file system on  cre-
          ation  by including a "Key":"Name","Value":"{value}" key-value pair.
          Each key must be unique. For more information,  see  Tagging  Amazon
          Web  Services resources in the Amazon Web Services General Reference
          Guide .

          (structure)
              A tag is a key-value pair. Allowed characters are letters, white
              space,  and  numbers  that  can be represented in UTF-8, and the
              following characters:+ - = . _ : / .

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag key (String). The key can't start with aws: .

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To create an encrypted file system

       The following create-file-system example creates an encrypted file sys-
       tem using the default CMK. It also adds the tag Name=my-file-system.

          aws efs create-file-system \
              --performance-mode generalPurpose \
              --throughput-mode bursting \

OUTPUT
       OwnerId -> (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account that created the file system. If the
          file  system was created by an IAM user, the parent account to which
          the user belongs is the owner.

       CreationToken -> (string)
          The opaque string specified in the request.

       FileSystemId -> (string)
          The ID of the file system, assigned by Amazon EFS.

       FileSystemArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the EFS file system, in the  for-
          mat   arn:aws:elasticfilesystem:*region*   :*account-id*  :file-sys-
          tem/*file-system-id* `` . Example with sample data:  ``arn:aws:elas-
          ticfilesystem:us-west-2:1111333322228888:file-system/fs-01234567

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The  time  that  the  file  system  was  created,  in seconds (since
          1970-01-01T00:00:00Z).

       LifeCycleState -> (string)
          The lifecycle phase of the file system.

       Name -> (string)
          You can add tags to a file system, including a Name  tag.  For  more
          information,  see   CreateFileSystem . If the file system has a Name
          tag, Amazon EFS returns the value in this field.

       NumberOfMountTargets -> (integer)
          The current number of mount targets that the file  system  has.  For
          more information, see  CreateMountTarget .

       SizeInBytes -> (structure)
          The  latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the file
          system, in its Value field, and the time  at  which  that  size  was
          determined  in its Timestamp field. The Timestamp value is the inte-
          ger number of seconds since  1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.  The  SizeInBytes
          value  doesn't  represent  the  size of a consistent snapshot of the
          file system, but it is  eventually  consistent  when  there  are  no
          writes  to  the  file system. That is, SizeInBytes represents actual
          size only if the file system is not modified  for  a  period  longer
          than  a  couple of hours. Otherwise, the value is not the exact size
          that the file system was at any point in time.

          Value -> (long)
              The latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored  in  the
              file system.

          Timestamp -> (timestamp)
              The time at which the size of data, returned in the Value field,
              was determined. The value is the integer number of seconds since
              1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

          ValueInIA -> (long)
              The  latest  known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the
              Infrequent Access storage class.

          ValueInStandard -> (long)
              The latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored  in  the
              Standard storage class.

       PerformanceMode -> (string)
          The performance mode of the file system.

       Encrypted -> (boolean)
          A  Boolean  value  that,  if true, indicates that the file system is
          encrypted.

       KmsKeyId -> (string)
          The ID of an KMS key used to protect the encrypted file system.

       ThroughputMode -> (string)
          Displays the file system's throughput mode.  For  more  information,
          see Throughput modes in the Amazon EFS User Guide .

       ProvisionedThroughputInMibps -> (double)
          The  amount  of  provisioned  throughput, measured in MiB/s, for the
          file system. Valid for file systems using ThroughputMode set to pro-
          visioned .

       AvailabilityZoneName -> (string)
          Describes  the  Amazon  Web  Services Availability Zone in which the
          file system is located, and is valid only for file systems using One
          Zone  storage  classes.  For more information, see Using EFS storage
          classes in the Amazon EFS User Guide .

       AvailabilityZoneId -> (string)
          The unique and consistent identifier of  the  Availability  Zone  in
          which the file system's One Zone storage classes exist. For example,
          use1-az1 is an Availability Zone ID for  the  us-east-1  Amazon  Web
          Services  Region,  and  it has the same location in every Amazon Web
          Services account.

       Tags -> (list)
          The tags associated with the file system, presented as an  array  of
          Tag objects.

          (structure)
              A tag is a key-value pair. Allowed characters are letters, white
              space, and numbers that can be represented  in  UTF-8,  and  the
              following characters:+ - = . _ : / .

              Key -> (string)
