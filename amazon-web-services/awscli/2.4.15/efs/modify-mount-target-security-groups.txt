NAME
       modify-mount-target-security-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies the set of security groups in effect for a mount target.

       When  you  create a mount target, Amazon EFS also creates a new network
       interface. For more information, see  CreateMountTarget .  This  opera-
       tion  replaces  the security groups in effect for the network interface
       associated with a mount target, with the SecurityGroups provided in the
       request.  This  operation  requires  that  the network interface of the
       mount target has been created and the lifecycle state of the mount tar-
       get is not deleted .

       The operation requires permissions for the following actions:

       o elasticfilesystem:ModifyMountTargetSecurityGroups action on the mount
         target's file system.

       o ec2:ModifyNetworkInterfaceAttribute action on the mount target's net-
         work interface.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-mount-target-security-groups
          --mount-target-id <value>
          [--security-groups <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --mount-target-id (string)
          The ID of the mount target whose security groups you want to modify.

       --security-groups (list)
          An array of up to five VPC security group IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
