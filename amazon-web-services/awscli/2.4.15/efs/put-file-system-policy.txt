PUT-FILE-SYSTEM-POLICY()                              PUT-FILE-SYSTEM-POLICY()



NAME
       put-file-system-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Applies  an Amazon EFS FileSystemPolicy to an Amazon EFS file system. A
       file system policy is an IAM resource-based policy and can contain mul-
       tiple policy statements. A file system always has exactly one file sys-
       tem policy, which can be the default policy or an explicit  policy  set
       or  updated  using  this API operation. EFS file system policies have a
       20,000 character limit. When an explicit policy is  set,  it  overrides
       the  default policy. For more information about the default file system
       policy, see Default EFS File System Policy .

       NOTE:
          EFS file system policies have a 20,000 character limit.

       This operation  requires  permissions  for  the  elasticfilesystem:Put-
       FileSystemPolicy action.

SYNOPSIS
            put-file-system-policy
          --file-system-id <value>
          --policy <value>
          [--bypass-policy-lockout-safety-check | --no-bypass-policy-lockout-safety-check]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --file-system-id (string)
          The  ID of the EFS file system that you want to create or update the
          FileSystemPolicy for.

       --policy (string)
          The FileSystemPolicy that you're creating. Accepts a JSON  formatted
          policy  definition. EFS file system policies have a 20,000 character
          limit. To find out more about the elements that make up a file  sys-
          tem policy, see EFS Resource-based Policies .

       --bypass-policy-lockout-safety-check     |     --no-bypass-policy-lock-
       out-safety-check (boolean)
          (Optional) A flag to indicate whether to bypass the FileSystemPolicy
          lockout  safety  check.  The  policy lockout safety check determines
          whether the policy in the request will prevent the principal  making
          the  request will be locked out from making future PutFileSystemPol-
          icy requests on the file system. Set  BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck
          to True only when you intend to prevent the principal that is making
          the request from making a subsequent PutFileSystemPolicy request  on
          the file system. The default value is False.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FileSystemId -> (string)
          Specifies the EFS file system to which the FileSystemPolicy applies.

       Policy -> (string)
          The JSON formatted FileSystemPolicy for the EFS file system.
