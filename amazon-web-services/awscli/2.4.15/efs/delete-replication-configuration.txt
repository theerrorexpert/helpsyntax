NAME
       delete-replication-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  an existing replication configuration. To delete a replication
       configuration, you must make the request from the Amazon  Web  Services
       Region  in  which  the  destination  file system is located. Deleting a
       replication configuration ends the replication process. You  can  write
       to the destination file system once it's status becomes Writeable .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-replication-configuration
          --source-file-system-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-file-system-id (string)
          The ID of the source file system in the replication configuration.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
