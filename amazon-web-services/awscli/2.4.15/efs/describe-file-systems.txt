DESCRIBE-FILE-SYSTEMS()                                DESCRIBE-FILE-SYSTEMS()



NAME
       describe-file-systems -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the description of a specific Amazon EFS file system if either
       the file system CreationToken or the FileSystemId is  provided.  Other-
       wise, it returns descriptions of all file systems owned by the caller's
       Amazon Web Services account in the Amazon Web Services  Region  of  the
       endpoint that you're calling.

       When  retrieving all file system descriptions, you can optionally spec-
       ify the MaxItems parameter to limit the number  of  descriptions  in  a
       response.  Currently,  this  number is automatically set to 10. If more
       file system descriptions remain, Amazon EFS returns a NextMarker  ,  an
       opaque  token,  in the response. In this case, you should send a subse-
       quent request with the Marker request parameter set  to  the  value  of
       NextMarker .

       To  retrieve a list of your file system descriptions, this operation is
       used in an iterative process, where DescribeFileSystems is called first
       without the Marker and then the operation continues to call it with the
       Marker parameter set to the value of the NextMarker from  the  previous
       response until the response has no NextMarker .

       The   order   of   file   systems  returned  in  the  response  of  one
       DescribeFileSystems call and the order of file systems returned  across
       the responses of a multi-call iteration is unspecified.

       This   operation   requires   permissions   for   the   elasticfilesys-
       tem:DescribeFileSystems action.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-file-systems is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: FileSystems

SYNOPSIS
            describe-file-systems
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--creation-token <value>]
          [--file-system-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --creation-token (string)
          (Optional)  Restricts the list to the file system with this creation
          token (String). You specify a creation token when you create an Ama-
          zon EFS file system.

       --file-system-id (string)
          (Optional)  ID  of  the  file  system  whose description you want to
          retrieve (String).

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              A description of the file system.

              OwnerId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account that created the file system.
                 If the file system was created by an  IAM  user,  the  parent
                 account to which the user belongs is the owner.

              CreationToken -> (string)
                 The opaque string specified in the request.

              FileSystemId -> (string)
                 The ID of the file system, assigned by Amazon EFS.

              FileSystemArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) for the EFS file system, in
                 the format  arn:aws:elasticfilesystem:*region*  :*account-id*
                 :file-system/*file-system-id*  `` . Example with sample data:
                 ``arn:aws:elasticfilesys-
                 tem:us-west-2:1111333322228888:file-system/fs-01234567

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time that the file system was created, in seconds (since
                 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z).

              LifeCycleState -> (string)
                 The lifecycle phase of the file system.

              Name -> (string)
                 You can add tags to a file system, including a Name tag.  For
                 more  information, see  CreateFileSystem . If the file system
                 has a Name tag, Amazon EFS returns the value in this field.

              NumberOfMountTargets -> (integer)
                 The current number of mount targets that the file system has.
                 For more information, see  CreateMountTarget .

              SizeInBytes -> (structure)
                 The  latest  known  metered size (in bytes) of data stored in
                 the file system, in its Value field, and the  time  at  which
                 that  size  was  determined in its Timestamp field. The Time-
                 stamp  value  is  the  integer  number   of   seconds   since
                 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. The SizeInBytes value doesn't represent
                 the size of a consistent snapshot of the file system, but  it
                 is eventually consistent when there are no writes to the file
                 system. That is, SizeInBytes represents actual size  only  if
                 the  file  system  is not modified for a period longer than a
                 couple of hours. Otherwise, the value is not the  exact  size
                 that the file system was at any point in time.

                 Value -> (long)
                     The  latest  known metered size (in bytes) of data stored
                     in the file system.

                 Timestamp -> (timestamp)
                     The time at which the size of data, returned in the Value
                     field, was determined. The value is the integer number of
                     seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

                 ValueInIA -> (long)
                     The latest known metered size (in bytes) of  data  stored
                     in the Infrequent Access storage class.

                 ValueInStandard -> (long)
                     The  latest  known metered size (in bytes) of data stored
                     in the Standard storage class.

              PerformanceMode -> (string)
                 The performance mode of the file system.

              Encrypted -> (boolean)
                 A Boolean value that, if true, indicates that the file system
                 is encrypted.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The  ID of an KMS key used to protect the encrypted file sys-
                 tem.

              ThroughputMode -> (string)
                 Displays the file system's throughput mode. For more informa-
                 tion, see Throughput modes in the Amazon EFS User Guide .

              ProvisionedThroughputInMibps -> (double)
                 The  amount of provisioned throughput, measured in MiB/s, for
                 the file system. Valid for file systems using  ThroughputMode
                 set to provisioned .

              AvailabilityZoneName -> (string)
                 Describes  the Amazon Web Services Availability Zone in which
                 the file system is located, and is valid only for  file  sys-
                 tems  using  One  Zone storage classes. For more information,
                 see Using EFS storage classes in the Amazon EFS User Guide  .

              AvailabilityZoneId -> (string)
                 The unique and consistent identifier of the Availability Zone
                 in which the file system's One Zone  storage  classes  exist.
                 For  example,  use1-az1  is  an  Availability Zone ID for the
                 us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region, and  it  has  the  same
                 location in every Amazon Web Services account.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The  tags  associated  with  the file system, presented as an
                 array of Tag objects.

                 (structure)
                     A tag is a key-value pair. Allowed  characters  are  let-
                     ters, white space, and numbers that can be represented in
                     UTF-8, and the following characters:+ - = . _ : / .

                     Key -> (string)
                        The tag key (String). The key can't start with aws:  .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag key.

       NextMarker -> (string)
          Present if there are more file systems than returned in the response
          (String). You can use the NextMarker in the  subsequent  request  to
          fetch the descriptions.
