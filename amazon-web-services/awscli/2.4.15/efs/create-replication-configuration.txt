NAME
       create-replication-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  replication  configuration  that replicates an existing EFS
       file system to a new, read-only file system. For more information,  see
       Amazon  EFS  replication  . The replication configuration specifies the
       following:

       o Source file system - an existing EFS file system that you want repli-
         cated.  The source file system cannot be a destination file system in
         an existing replication configuration.

       o Destination file system configuration - the configuration of the des-
         tination  file  system to which the source file system will be repli-
         cated. There can only be one destination file system in a replication
         configuration.

         o Amazon  Web  Services  Region  -  The Amazon Web Services Region in
           which the destination file system is created.  EFS  Replication  is
           available  in  all  Amazon  Web  Services Region that Amazon EFS is
           available in, except the  following  regions:  Asia  Pacific  (Hong
           Kong)  Europe  (Milan),  Middle East (Bahrain), Africa (Cape Town),
           and Asia Pacific (Jakarta).

         o Availability zone - If you want the destination file system to  use
           One  Zone  availability and durability, you must specify the Avail-
           ability Zone to create the file system  in.  For  more  information
           about  EFS  storage  classes, see Amazon EFS storage classes in the
           Amazon EFS User Guide .

         o Encryption - All destination file systems are created with  encryp-
           tion  at  rest enabled. You can specify the KMS key that is used to
           encrypt the destination file system. Your service-managed  KMS  key
           for  Amazon  EFS is used if you don't specify a KMS key. You cannot
           change this after the file system is created.

       The following properties are set by default:

       o Performance mode - The destination  file  system's  performance  mode
         will  match  that  of  the source file system, unless the destination
         file system uses One Zone storage. In that case, the General  Purpose
         performance mode is used. The Performance mode cannot be changed.

       o Throughput  mode  -  The  destination  file  system  use the Bursting
         throughput mode by default. You can modify the throughput  mode  once
         the file system is created.

       The following properties are turned off by default:

       o Lifecycle management - EFS lifecycle management and intelligent tier-
         ing are not enabled on the destination file system.  You  can  enable
         EFS  lifecycle  management and intelligent tiering after the destina-
         tion file system is created.

       o Automatic backups - Automatic daily backups not enabled on the desti-
         nation file system. You can change this setting after the file system
         is created.

SYNOPSIS
            create-replication-configuration
          --source-file-system-id <value>
          --destinations <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-file-system-id (string)
          Specifies the Amazon EFS file system that  you  want  to  replicate.
          This file system cannot already be a source or destination file sys-
          tem in another replication configuration.

       --destinations (list)
          An array of destination configuration objects. Only one  destination
          configuration object is supported.

          (structure)
              Describes  the destination file system to create in the replica-
              tion configuration.

              Region -> (string)
                 To create a file system that uses regional  storage,  specify
                 the  Amazon Web Services Region in which to create the desti-
                 nation file system.

              AvailabilityZoneName -> (string)
                 To create a file system that uses One Zone  storage,  specify
                 the name of the Availability Zone in which to create the des-
                 tination file system.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 Specifies the KMS key you want to use to encrypt the destina-
                 tion  file  system. If you do not specify a KMS key, EFS uses
                 your default KMS key for Amazon EFS, /aws/elasticfilesystem .
                 This ID can be in one of the following formats:

                 o Key  ID  -  A  unique  identifier  of  the key, for example
                   1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab .

                 o ARN - An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the key, for  exam-
                   ple
                   arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
                   .

                 o Key  alias  -  A previously created display name for a key,
                   for example alias/projectKey1 .

                 o Key alias ARN -  An  ARN  for  a  key  alias,  for  example
                   arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:444455556666:alias/projectKey1 .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Region=string,AvailabilityZoneName=string,KmsKeyId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Region": "string",
              "AvailabilityZoneName": "string",
              "KmsKeyId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SourceFileSystemId -> (string)
          The  ID  of  the  source Amazon EFS file system that is being repli-
          cated.

       SourceFileSystemRegion -> (string)
          The Amazon Web Services Region in which the source Amazon  EFS  file
          system is located.

       SourceFileSystemArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the current source file system in the replication config-
          uration.

       OriginalSourceFileSystemArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  original  source  Amazon  EFS
          file system in the replication configuration.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          Describes when the replication configuration was created.

       Destinations -> (list)

          ported.

          (structure)

              uration.

              Status -> (string)

                 system is located.

              LastReplicatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The  time when the most recent sync successfully completed on
                 the destination file system.  Any  changes  to  data  on  the
                 source file system that occurred prior to this time were suc-
                 cessfully replicated to  the  destination  file  system.  Any
                 changes  that  occurred  after  this  time might not be fully
                 replicated.
