NAME
       update-file-system -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the throughput mode or the amount of provisioned throughput of
       an existing file system.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-file-system
          --file-system-id <value>
          [--throughput-mode <value>]
          [--provisioned-throughput-in-mibps <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --file-system-id (string)
          The ID of the file system that you want to update.

       --throughput-mode (string)
          (Optional) Updates the file system's throughput mode. If you're  not
          updating  your throughput mode, you don't need to provide this value
          in your request. If you are changing the  ThroughputMode  to  provi-
          sioned  , you must also set a value for ProvisionedThroughputInMibps
          .

          Possible values:

          o bursting

          o provisioned

       --provisioned-throughput-in-mibps (double)
          (Optional) Sets the amount of provisioned throughput, in MiB/s,  for
          the  file  system.  Valid values are 1-1024. If you are changing the
          throughput mode to provisioned, you must also provide the amount  of
          provisioned  throughput.  Required  if  ThroughputMode is changed to
          provisioned on update.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       OwnerId -> (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account that created the file system. If the
          file  system was created by an IAM user, the parent account to which
          the user belongs is the owner.

       CreationToken -> (string)
          The opaque string specified in the request.

       FileSystemId -> (string)
          The ID of the file system, assigned by Amazon EFS.

       FileSystemArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the EFS file system, in the  for-
          mat   arn:aws:elasticfilesystem:*region*   :*account-id*  :file-sys-
          tem/*file-system-id* `` . Example with sample data:  ``arn:aws:elas-
          ticfilesystem:us-west-2:1111333322228888:file-system/fs-01234567

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The  time  that  the  file  system  was  created,  in seconds (since
          1970-01-01T00:00:00Z).

       LifeCycleState -> (string)
          The lifecycle phase of the file system.

       Name -> (string)
          You can add tags to a file system, including a Name  tag.  For  more
          information,  see   CreateFileSystem . If the file system has a Name
          tag, Amazon EFS returns the value in this field.

       NumberOfMountTargets -> (integer)
          The current number of mount targets that the file  system  has.  For
          more information, see  CreateMountTarget .

       SizeInBytes -> (structure)
          The  latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the file
          system, in its Value field, and the time  at  which  that  size  was
          determined  in its Timestamp field. The Timestamp value is the inte-
          ger number of seconds since  1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.  The  SizeInBytes
          value  doesn't  represent  the  size of a consistent snapshot of the
          file system, but it is  eventually  consistent  when  there  are  no
          writes  to  the  file system. That is, SizeInBytes represents actual
          size only if the file system is not modified  for  a  period  longer
          than  a  couple of hours. Otherwise, the value is not the exact size
          that the file system was at any point in time.

          Value -> (long)
              The latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored  in  the
              file system.

          Timestamp -> (timestamp)
              The time at which the size of data, returned in the Value field,
              was determined. The value is the integer number of seconds since
              1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

          ValueInIA -> (long)
              The  latest  known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the
              Infrequent Access storage class.

          ValueInStandard -> (long)
              The latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored  in  the
              Standard storage class.

       PerformanceMode -> (string)
          The performance mode of the file system.

       Encrypted -> (boolean)
          A  Boolean  value  that,  if true, indicates that the file system is
          encrypted.

       KmsKeyId -> (string)
          The ID of an KMS key used to protect the encrypted file system.

       ThroughputMode -> (string)
          Displays the file system's throughput mode.  For  more  information,
          see Throughput modes in the Amazon EFS User Guide .

       ProvisionedThroughputInMibps -> (double)
          The  amount  of  provisioned  throughput, measured in MiB/s, for the
          file system. Valid for file systems using ThroughputMode set to pro-
          visioned .

       AvailabilityZoneName -> (string)
          Describes  the  Amazon  Web  Services Availability Zone in which the
          file system is located, and is valid only for file systems using One
          Zone  storage  classes.  For more information, see Using EFS storage
          classes in the Amazon EFS User Guide .

       AvailabilityZoneId -> (string)
          The unique and consistent identifier of  the  Availability  Zone  in
          which the file system's One Zone storage classes exist. For example,
          use1-az1 is an Availability Zone ID for  the  us-east-1  Amazon  Web
          Services  Region,  and  it has the same location in every Amazon Web
          Services account.

       Tags -> (list)
          The tags associated with the file system, presented as an  array  of
          Tag objects.

          (structure)
              A tag is a key-value pair. Allowed characters are letters, white
              space, and numbers that can be represented  in  UTF-8,  and  the
              following characters:+ - = . _ : / .

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag key (String). The key can't start with aws: .

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag key.
