EXAMPLES
       To add an item to a table

       This example adds a new item to the MusicCollection table.

       Command:

          aws ddb put MusicCollection '{Artist: "No One You Know", SongTitle: "Call Me Today", AlbumTitle: "Somewhat Famous"}'

       To add items to a table from a file

       This  example adds two new items from a file to the MusicCollection ta-
       ble.

       Command:

          aws ddb put MusicCollection file://items.json

       The items to add to the table are in a JSON file, items.json. Here  are
       the contents of that file:

          [
              {
                  "Artist": "No One You Know",
                  "SongTitle": "Call Me Today",
                  "AlbumTitle": "Somewhat Famous"
              },
              {
                  "Artist": "No One You Know",
                  "SongTitle": "Scared of My Shadow",
                  "AlbumTitle": "Blue Sky Blues"
              }
          ]

       To add items to a table from stdin

       This example adds a new item to the MusicCollection table by reading it
       from stdin.

       Command:

          echo '{Artist: "No One You Know", SongTitle: "Call Me Today"}' \
              | aws ddb put MusicCollection -

       Conditional Expressions

       This example shows how to perform  a  one-line  conditional  operation.
       This  put  call to the table MusicCollection table will only succeed if
       the artist "Obscure Indie Band" does not exist in the table.

       Command:

          aws ddb put MusicCollection '{Artist: "Obscure Indie Band", SongTitle: "Atlas"}' \
              --condition 'attribute_not_exists(Artist)'

       If the key already exists, you should see:

       Output:

          A client error (ConditionalCheckFailedException) occurred when calling the PutItem operation: The conditional request failed



                                                                         PUT()
