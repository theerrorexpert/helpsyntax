DESCRIBE-OBJECTS()                                          DESCRIBE-OBJECTS()



NAME
       describe-objects -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the  object  definitions for a set of objects associated with the
       pipeline. Object definitions are composed  of  a  set  of  fields  that
       define the properties of the object.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-objects  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: pipelineObjects

SYNOPSIS
            describe-objects
          --pipeline-id <value>
          --object-ids <value>
          [--evaluate-expressions | --no-evaluate-expressions]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pipeline-id (string)
          The ID of the pipeline that contains the object definitions.

       --object-ids (list)
          The IDs of the pipeline objects that contain the definitions  to  be
          described.  You  can pass as many as 25 identifiers in a single call
          to DescribeObjects .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --evaluate-expressions | --no-evaluate-expressions (boolean)
          Indicates whether any expressions in the object should be  evaluated
          when the object descriptions are returned.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       pipelineObjects -> (list)
          An array of object definitions.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a pipeline object. This can be a log-
              ical, physical, or physical attempt pipeline  object.  The  com-
              plete set of components of a pipeline defines the pipeline.

              id -> (string)
                 The ID of the object.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the object.

              fields -> (list)
                 Key-value pairs that define the properties of the object.

                 (structure)
                     A  key-value pair that describes a property of a pipeline
                     object. The value is specified as either a  string  value
                     (StringValue ) or a reference to another object (RefValue
                     ) but not as both.

                     key -> (string)
                        The field identifier.

                     stringValue -> (string)
                        The field value, expressed as a String.

                     refValue -> (string)
                        The  field  value,  expressed  as  the  identifier  of
                        another object.

       marker -> (string)
          The  starting  point  for the next page of results. To view the next
          page of results, call DescribeObjects again with this marker  value.
          If the value is null, there are no more results.

       hasMoreResults -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether there are more results to return.
