REPORT-TASK-PROGRESS()                                  REPORT-TASK-PROGRESS()



NAME
       report-task-progress -

DESCRIPTION
       Task  runners  call ReportTaskProgress when assigned a task to acknowl-
       edge that it has the task. If the web service  does  not  receive  this
       acknowledgement  within  2 minutes, it assigns the task in a subsequent
       PollForTask call. After this initial acknowledgement, the  task  runner
       only  needs  to report progress every 15 minutes to maintain its owner-
       ship of the task. You can change this reporting time from 15 minutes by
       specifying a reportProgressTimeout field in your pipeline.

       If  a  task runner does not report its status after 5 minutes, AWS Data
       Pipeline assumes that the task runner is unable to process the task and
       reassigns the task in a subsequent response to  PollForTask . Task run-
       ners should call ReportTaskProgress every 60 seconds.

SYNOPSIS
            report-task-progress
          --task-id <value>
          [--fields <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --task-id (string)
          The ID of the task assigned to the task runner. This value  is  pro-
          vided in the response for  PollForTask .

       --fields (list)
          Key-value  pairs  that  define  the properties of the ReportTaskPro-
          gressInput object.

          (structure)
              A key-value pair that describes a property of a pipeline object.
              The  value  is specified as either a string value (StringValue )
              or a reference to another object (RefValue ) but not as both.

              key -> (string)
                 The field identifier.

              stringValue -> (string)
                 The field value, expressed as a String.

              refValue -> (string)
                 The field value,  expressed  as  the  identifier  of  another
                 object.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,stringValue=string,refValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "stringValue": "string",
              "refValue": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       canceled -> (boolean)
          If  true,  the  calling  task runner should cancel processing of the
          task. The task runner does not need to call  SetTaskStatus for  can-
          celed tasks.
