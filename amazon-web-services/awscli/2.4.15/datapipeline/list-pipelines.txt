LIST-PIPELINES()                                              LIST-PIPELINES()



NAME
       list-pipelines -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  pipeline identifiers for all active pipelines that you have
       permission to access.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-pipelines is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: pipelineIdList

SYNOPSIS
            list-pipelines
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list your pipelines

       This example lists your pipelines:

          aws datapipeline list-pipelines

       The following is example output:

          {
            "pipelineIdList": [
                {
                    "id": "df-00627471SOVYZEXAMPLE",
                    "name": "my-pipeline"
                },
                {
                    "id": "df-09028963KNVMREXAMPLE",
                    "name": "ImportDDB"
                },
                {
                    "id": "df-0870198233ZYVEXAMPLE",
                    "name": "CrossRegionDDB"
                },
                {
                    "id": "df-00189603TB4MZEXAMPLE",
                    "name": "CopyRedshift"
                }
            ]
          }

OUTPUT
       pipelineIdList -> (list)
          The  pipeline  identifiers.  If  you  require additional information
          about  the  pipelines,  you  can  use  these  identifiers  to   call
          DescribePipelines and  GetPipelineDefinition .

          (structure)
              Contains the name and identifier of a pipeline.

              id -> (string)
                 The  ID  of  the pipeline that was assigned by AWS Data Pipe-
                 line. This is a string of the form df-297EG78HU43EEXAMPLE .

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the pipeline.

       marker -> (string)
          The starting point for the next page of results. To  view  the  next
          page  of  results,  call  ListPipelinesOutput again with this marker
          value. If the value is null, there are no more results.

       hasMoreResults -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether there are more results that can be obtained  by  a
          subsequent call.
