POLL-FOR-TASK()                                                POLL-FOR-TASK()



NAME
       poll-for-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Task  runners  call  PollForTask  to receive a task to perform from AWS
       Data Pipeline. The task runner specifies which tasks it can perform  by
       setting  a  value  for the workerGroup parameter. The task returned can
       come from any of the pipelines that match the workerGroup value  passed
       in  by the task runner and that was launched using the IAM user creden-
       tials specified by the task runner.

       If tasks are ready in the work queue, PollForTask  returns  a  response
       immediately.  If  no tasks are available in the queue, PollForTask uses
       long-polling and holds on to a poll connection for up to a 90  seconds,
       during  which time the first newly scheduled task is handed to the task
       runner. To accomodate this, set the socket timeout in your task  runner
       to 90 seconds. The task runner should not call PollForTask again on the
       same workerGroup until it receives a response, and this can take up  to
       90 seconds.

SYNOPSIS
            poll-for-task
          --worker-group <value>
          [--hostname <value>]
          [--instance-identity <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --worker-group (string)
          The  type  of  task  the  task  runner  is  configured to accept and
          process. The worker group is set as a field on objects in the  pipe-
          line  when they are created. You can only specify a single value for
          workerGroup in the call to PollForTask . There are no wildcard  val-
          ues  permitted  in  workerGroup  ;  the  string  must  be  an exact,
          case-sensitive, match.

       --hostname (string)
          The public DNS name of the calling task runner.

       --instance-identity (structure)
          Identity information for the EC2 instance that is hosting  the  task
          runner.   You   can   get   this   value  from  the  instance  using
          http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id   .   For   more
          information,  see  Instance  Metadata  in the Amazon Elastic Compute
          Cloud User Guide. Passing in this value proves that your task runner
          is running on an EC2 instance, and ensures the proper AWS Data Pipe-
          line service charges are applied to your pipeline.

          document -> (string)
              A description of an EC2 instance  that  is  generated  when  the
              instance  is  launched  and  exposed  to  the  instance  via the
              instance metadata service in the form of a  JSON  representation
              of an object.

          signature -> (string)
              A signature which can be used to verify the accuracy and authen-
              ticity of the information provided in the instance identity doc-
              ument.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          document=string,signature=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "document": "string",
            "signature": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       taskObject -> (structure)
          The  information  needed to complete the task that is being assigned
          to the task runner. One of the fields returned  in  this  object  is
          taskId  ,  which contains an identifier for the task being assigned.
          The calling task runner uses taskId in subsequent calls to   Report-
          TaskProgress and  SetTaskStatus .

          taskId -> (string)
              An  internal  identifier  for the task. This ID is passed to the
              SetTaskStatus and  ReportTaskProgress actions.

          pipelineId -> (string)
              The ID of the pipeline that provided the task.

          attemptId -> (string)
              The ID of the pipeline task attempt object.  AWS  Data  Pipeline
              uses this value to track how many times a task is attempted.

          objects -> (map)
              Connection  information  for  the location where the task runner
              will publish the output of the task.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                 Contains information about a pipeline object. This can  be  a
                 logical,  physical,  or physical attempt pipeline object. The
                 complete set of components of a pipeline  defines  the  pipe-
                 line.

                 id -> (string)
                     The ID of the object.

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of the object.

                 fields -> (list)
                     Key-value pairs that define the properties of the object.

                     (structure)
                        A key-value pair that describes a property of a  pipe-
                        line object. The value is specified as either a string
                        value (StringValue ) or a reference to another  object
                        (RefValue ) but not as both.

                        key -> (string)
                            The field identifier.

                        stringValue -> (string)
                            The field value, expressed as a String.

                        refValue -> (string)
                            The  field  value,  expressed as the identifier of
                            another object.
