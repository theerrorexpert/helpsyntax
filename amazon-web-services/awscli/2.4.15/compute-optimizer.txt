NAME
       compute-optimizer -

DESCRIPTION
       Compute Optimizer is a service that analyzes the configuration and uti-
       lization metrics of your Amazon Web Services compute resources, such as
       Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, Lambda functions,
       and Amazon EBS volumes. It reports whether your resources are  optimal,
       and  generates  optimization  recommendations  to  reduce  the cost and
       improve the performance of your workloads. Compute Optimizer also  pro-
       vides recent utilization metric data, in addition to projected utiliza-
       tion metric data for the recommendations, which you can use to evaluate
       which recommendation provides the best price-performance trade-off. The
       analysis of your usage patterns can help you decide  when  to  move  or
       resize  your  running  resources,  and  still meet your performance and
       capacity requirements. For more information  about  Compute  Optimizer,
       including  the required permissions to use the service, see the Compute
       Optimizer User Guide .
