NAME
       list-routing-profile-queues -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the queues associated with a routing profile.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-routing-profile-queues  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the  following  query  expressions:  RoutingProfileQueueConfigSumma-
       ryList

SYNOPSIS
            list-routing-profile-queues
          --instance-id <value>
          --routing-profile-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the  Amazon  Connect instance. You can find the
          instanceId in the ARN of the instance.

       --routing-profile-id (string)
          The identifier of the routing profile.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If  there are additional results, this is the token for the next set
          of results.

       RoutingProfileQueueConfigSummaryList -> (list)
          Information about the routing profiles.

          (structure)
              Contains summary information about a routing profile queue.

              QueueId -> (string)
                 The identifier for the queue.

              QueueArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the queue.

              QueueName -> (string)
                 The name of the queue.

              Priority -> (integer)
                 The order in which contacts are to be handled for the  queue.
                 For more information, see Queues: priority and delay .

              Delay -> (integer)
                 The  delay, in seconds, that a contact should be in the queue
                 before they are routed to an available agent. For more infor-
                 mation,  see Queues: priority and delay in the Amazon Connect
                 Administrator Guide .

              Channel -> (string)
                 The channels this queue supports.
