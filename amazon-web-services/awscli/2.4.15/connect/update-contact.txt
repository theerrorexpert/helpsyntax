OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the  Amazon  Connect instance. You can find the
          instanceId in the ARN of the instance.

       --contact-id (string)
          The identifier of the contact. This is the identifier of the contact
          associated with the first interaction with your contact center.

          The name of the contact.

       --description (string)
          The description of the contact.

       --references (map)
          A  formatted  URL  that  is shown to an agent in the Contact Control
          Panel (CCP).

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              A link that an agent selects to complete a given task.  You  can
              have  up  to  4,096 UTF-8 bytes across all references for a con-
              tact.

              Value -> (string)
                 A valid value for the reference. For example, for a URL  ref-
                 erence,  a formatted URL that is displayed to an agent in the
                 Contact Control Panel (CCP).

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of the reference. Only URL  type  can  be  added  or
                 updated on a contact.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=Value=string,Type=string,KeyName2=Value=string,Type=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": {
                "Value": "string",
                "Type": "URL"|"ATTACHMENT"
              }
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
