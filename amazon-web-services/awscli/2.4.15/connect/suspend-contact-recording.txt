SUSPEND-CONTACT-RECORDING()                        SUSPEND-CONTACT-RECORDING()



NAME
       suspend-contact-recording -

DESCRIPTION
       When a contact is being recorded, this API suspends recording the call.
       For example, you might suspend the call recording while collecting sen-
       sitive  information,  such as a credit card number. Then use ResumeCon-
       tactRecording to restart recording.

       The period of time that the  recording  is  suspended  is  filled  with
       silence in the final recording.

       Only voice recordings are supported at this time.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            suspend-contact-recording
          --instance-id <value>
          --contact-id <value>
          --initial-contact-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the  Amazon  Connect instance. You can find the
          instanceId in the ARN of the instance.

       --contact-id (string)
          The identifier of the contact.

       --initial-contact-id (string)
          The identifier of the contact. This is the identifier of the contact
          associated with the first interaction with the contact center.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
