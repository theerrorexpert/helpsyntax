          --instance-id <value>
          --routing-profile-id <value>
          --queue-configs <value>

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the  Amazon  Connect instance. You can find the
          instanceId in the ARN of the instance.

       --routing-profile-id (string)
          The identifier of the routing profile.

       --queue-configs (list)
          The queues to associate with this routing profile.

          (structure)
              Contains information about the queue and channel for which  pri-
              ority and delay can be set.

              QueueReference -> (structure)
                 Contains information about a queue resource.

                 QueueId -> (string)
                     The identifier for the queue.

                 Channel -> (string)
                     The  channels  agents  can  handle in the Contact Control
                     Panel (CCP) for this routing profile.

              Priority -> (integer)
                 The order in which contacts are to be handled for the  queue.
                 For more information, see Queues: priority and delay .

              Delay -> (integer)
                 The  delay,  in  seconds,  a  contact  should be in the queue
                 before they are routed to an available agent. For more infor-
                 mation,  see Queues: priority and delay in the Amazon Connect
                 Administrator Guide .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          QueueReference={QueueId=string,Channel=string},Priority=integer,Delay=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "QueueReference": {
                "QueueId": "string",
                "Channel": "VOICE"|"CHAT"|"TASK"
              },
              "Priority": integer,
              "Delay": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
