START-CONTACT-RECORDING()                            START-CONTACT-RECORDING()



NAME
       start-contact-recording -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  recording  the contact when the agent joins the call. StartCon-
       tactRecording is a one-time action. For example, if you use StopContac-
       tRecording  to  stop recording an ongoing call, you can't use StartCon-
       tactRecording to restart it. For  scenarios  where  the  recording  has
       started  and you want to suspend and resume it, such as when collecting
       sensitive information (for example, a credit card number), use Suspend-
       ContactRecording and ResumeContactRecording.

       You  can  use this API to override the recording behavior configured in
       the Set recording behavior block.

       Only voice recordings are supported at this time.

SYNOPSIS
            start-contact-recording
          --instance-id <value>
          --contact-id <value>
          --initial-contact-id <value>
          --voice-recording-configuration <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The identifier of the Amazon Connect  instance.  You  can  find  the
          instanceId in the ARN of the instance.

       --contact-id (string)
          The identifier of the contact.

       --initial-contact-id (string)
          The identifier of the contact. This is the identifier of the contact
          associated with the first interaction with the contact center.

       --voice-recording-configuration (structure)
          The person being recorded.

          VoiceRecordingTrack -> (string)
              Identifies which track is being recorded.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          VoiceRecordingTrack=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "VoiceRecordingTrack": "FROM_AGENT"|"TO_AGENT"|"ALL"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
