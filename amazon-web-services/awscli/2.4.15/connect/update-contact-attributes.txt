UPDATE-CONTACT-ATTRIBUTES()                        UPDATE-CONTACT-ATTRIBUTES()



NAME
       update-contact-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  or updates user-defined contact attributes associated with the
       specified contact.

       You can create or update user-defined attributes for both  ongoing  and
       completed  contacts.  For  example,  while  the call is active, you can
       update the customer's name or the reason the customer called.  You  can
       add  notes about steps that the agent took during the call that display
       to the next agent that takes the call. You can also  update  attributes
       for  a  contact  using data from your CRM application and save the data
       with the contact in Amazon Connect. You could also flag calls for addi-
       tional analysis, such as legal review or to identify abusive callers.

       Contact  attributes  are available in Amazon Connect for 24 months, and
       are then deleted. For information about CTR retention and  the  maximum
       size  of  the CTR attributes section, see Feature specifications in the
       Amazon Connect Administrator Guide .
          Important: You cannot use the operation  to  update  attributes  for
          contacts  that  occurred  prior to the release of the API, which was
          September 12, 2018. You can update attributes only for contacts that
          started  after  the  release  of  the  API. If you attempt to update
          attributes for a contact that occurred prior to the release  of  the
          API,  a 400 error is returned. This applies also to queued callbacks
          that were initiated prior to the release of the API  but  are  still
          active in your instance.

SYNOPSIS
            update-contact-attributes
          --initial-contact-id <value>
          --instance-id <value>
          --attributes <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --initial-contact-id (string)
          The identifier of the contact. This is the identifier of the contact
          associated with the first interaction with the contact center.

       --instance-id (string)
          The identifier of the Amazon Connect  instance.  You  can  find  the
          instanceId in the ARN of the instance.

       --attributes (map)
          The  Amazon  Connect attributes. These attributes can be accessed in
          contact flows just like any other contact attributes.

          You can have up to 32,768 UTF-8 bytes across all  attributes  for  a
          contact.  Attribute  keys  can  include only alphanumeric, dash, and
          underscore characters.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update a contact's attribute

       The following update-contact-attributes example updates  the  greeting-
       Played attribute for the specified Amazon Connect user.

              --initial-contact-id 11111111-2222-3333-4444-12345678910 \
              --instance-id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111 \
              --attributes greetingPlayed=false

       This command produces no output.
