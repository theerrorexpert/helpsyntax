LIST-CONTACT-FLOWS()                                      LIST-CONTACT-FLOWS()



NAME
       list-contact-flows -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  information  about the contact flows for the specified Amazon
       Connect instance.

       You can also create and update contact flows using the  Amazon  Connect
       Flow language .

       For more information about contact flows, see Contact Flows in the Ama-
       zon Connect Administrator Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-contact-flows is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: ContactFlowSummaryList

SYNOPSIS
            list-contact-flows
          --instance-id <value>
          [--contact-flow-types <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the  Amazon  Connect instance. You can find the
          instanceId in the ARN of the instance.

       --contact-flow-types (list)
          The type of contact flow.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            CONTACT_FLOW
            CUSTOMER_QUEUE
            CUSTOMER_HOLD
            CUSTOMER_WHISPER
            AGENT_HOLD
            AGENT_WHISPER
            OUTBOUND_WHISPER
            AGENT_TRANSFER
            QUEUE_TRANSFER

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
