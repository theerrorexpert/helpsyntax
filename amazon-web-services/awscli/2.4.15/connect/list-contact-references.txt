NAME
       list-contact-references -

DESCRIPTION
       This  API  is  in  preview release for Amazon Connect and is subject to
       change.

       For the specified referenceTypes , returns a list of references associ-
       ated with the contact.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-contact-references  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: ReferenceSummaryList

SYNOPSIS
            list-contact-references
          --instance-id <value>
          --contact-id <value>
          --reference-types <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The identifier of the Amazon Connect  instance.  You  can  find  the
          instanceId in the ARN of the instance.

       --contact-id (string)
          The identifier of the initial contact.

       --reference-types (list)
          The type of reference.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            URL
            ATTACHMENT

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       ReferenceSummaryList -> (list)
          Information about the contact flows.

          (structure)
              Contains summary information about a reference. ReferenceSummary
              contains only one non null field between the URL and  attachment
              based on the reference type.

              Url -> (structure)
                 Information  about  the URL reference if the referenceType is
                 URL . Otherwise, null.

                 Name -> (string)
                     Identifier of the URL reference.

                 Value -> (string)
                     A valid URL.

              Attachment -> (structure)
                 Information about the attachment reference if the  reference-
                 Type is ATTACHMENT . Otherwise, null.

                 Name -> (string)
                     Identifier of the attachment reference.

                 Value -> (string)
                     Contains the location path of the attachment reference.

                 Status -> (string)
                     Status of an attachment reference type.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  there are additional results, this is the token for the next set
          of results.
