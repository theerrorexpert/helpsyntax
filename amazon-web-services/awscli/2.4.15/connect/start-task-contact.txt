OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the  Amazon  Connect instance. You can find the
          instanceId in the ARN of the instance.

       --previous-contact-id (string)
          The identifier of the previous chat, voice, or task contact.

       --contact-flow-id (string)
          The identifier of the contact flow for initiating the tasks. To  see
          the  ContactFlowId  in the Amazon Connect console user interface, on
          the navigation menu go to Routing , Contact Flows . Choose the  con-
          tact  flow.  On the contact flow page, under the name of the contact
          flow, choose Show additional flow information . The ContactFlowId is
          the last part of the ARN, shown here in bold:

          arn:aws:con-
          nect:us-west-2:xxxxxxxxxxxx:instance/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/con-
          tact-flow/846ec553-a005-41c0-8341-xxxxxxxxxxxx

       --attributes (map)
          A  custom  key-value pair using an attribute map. The attributes are
          standard Amazon Connect attributes, and can be accessed  in  contact
          flows just like any other contact attributes.

          There can be up to 32,768 UTF-8 bytes across all key-value pairs per
          contact. Attribute keys can include  only  alphanumeric,  dash,  and
          underscore characters.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --name (string)
          The  name of a task that is shown to an agent in the Contact Control
          Panel (CCP).

       --references (map)
          A formatted URL that is shown to an agent  in  the  Contact  Control
          Panel (CCP).

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              A  link  that an agent selects to complete a given task. You can
              have up to 4,096 UTF-8 bytes across all references  for  a  con-
              tact.

              Value -> (string)
                 A  valid value for the reference. For example, for a URL ref-
                 erence, a formatted URL that is displayed to an agent in  the
                 Contact Control Panel (CCP).

              Type -> (string)
                 The  type  of  the  reference.  Only URL type can be added or
                 updated on a contact.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=Value=string,Type=string,KeyName2=Value=string,Type=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": {
                "Value": "string",
                "Type": "URL"|"ATTACHMENT"
              }
            ...}

       --description (string)
          A description of the task that is shown to an agent in  the  Contact
          Control Panel (CCP).

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request.

       --scheduled-time (timestamp)
          The timestamp, in Unix Epoch seconds format, at which to start  run-
          ning  the  inbound contact flow. The scheduled time cannot be in the
          past. It must be within up to 6 days in future.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ContactId -> (string)
          The identifier of this contact within the Amazon Connect instance.
