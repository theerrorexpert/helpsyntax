LIST-HOURS-OF-OPERATIONS()                          LIST-HOURS-OF-OPERATIONS()



NAME
       list-hours-of-operations -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  information  about  the  hours of operation for the specified
       Amazon Connect instance.

       For more information about hours of operation, see  Set  the  Hours  of
       Operation for a Queue in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-hours-of-operations  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: HoursOfOperationSummaryList

SYNOPSIS
            list-hours-of-operations
          --instance-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The identifier of the Amazon Connect  instance.  You  can  find  the
          instanceId in the ARN of the instance.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the hours of operation in an instance

       The following list-hours-of-operations example lists the hours of oper-
       ations for the specified Amazon Connect instance.

          aws connect list-hours-of-operations \
              --instance-id 40c83b68-ea62-414c-97bb-d018e39e158e

       Output:

          {
              "HoursOfOperationSummaryList": [
                  {
                      "Id": "d69f1f84-7457-4924-8fbe-e64875546259",
                      "Arn": "arn:aws:connect:us-west-2:123456789012:instance/40c83b68-ea62-414c-97bb-d018e39e158e/operating-hours/d69f1f84-7457-4924-8fbe-e64875546259",
                      "Name": "Basic Hours"
                  }
              ]
          }
