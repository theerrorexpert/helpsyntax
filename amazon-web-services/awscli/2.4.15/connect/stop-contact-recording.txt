STOP-CONTACT-RECORDING()                              STOP-CONTACT-RECORDING()



NAME
       stop-contact-recording -

DESCRIPTION
       Stops  recording  a  call when a contact is being recorded. StopContac-
       tRecording is a one-time action. If  you  use  StopContactRecording  to
       stop  recording an ongoing call, you can't use StartContactRecording to
       restart it. For scenarios where the recording has started and you  want
       to  suspend  it  for  sensitive  information (for example, to collect a
       credit card number), and then restart it,  use  SuspendContactRecording
       and ResumeContactRecording.

       Only voice recordings are supported at this time.

SYNOPSIS
            stop-contact-recording
          --instance-id <value>
          --contact-id <value>
          --initial-contact-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the  Amazon  Connect instance. You can find the
          instanceId in the ARN of the instance.

       --contact-id (string)
          The identifier of the contact.

       --initial-contact-id (string)
          The identifier of the contact. This is the identifier of the contact
          associated with the first interaction with the contact center.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
