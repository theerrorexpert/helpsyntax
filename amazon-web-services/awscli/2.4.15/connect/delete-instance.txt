DELETE-INSTANCE()                                            DELETE-INSTANCE()



NAME
       delete-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       This  API  is  in  preview release for Amazon Connect and is subject to
       change.

       Deletes the Amazon Connect instance.

       Amazon Connect enforces a limit on the total number of  instances  that
       you can create or delete in 30 days. If you exceed this limit, you will
       get an error message indicating there has been an excessive  number  of
       attempts  at  creating  or  deleting  instances.  You must wait 30 days
       before you can restart creating and deleting instances in your account.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-instance
          --instance-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the  Amazon  Connect instance. You can find the
          instanceId in the ARN of the instance.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
