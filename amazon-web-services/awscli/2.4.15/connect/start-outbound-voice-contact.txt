START-OUTBOUND-VOICE-CONTACT()                  START-OUTBOUND-VOICE-CONTACT()



NAME
       start-outbound-voice-contact -

DESCRIPTION
       Places  an  outbound  call to a contact, and then initiates the contact
       flow. It performs the actions in the contact flow that's specified  (in
       ContactFlowId ).

       Agents  do  not initiate the outbound API, which means that they do not
       dial the contact. If the contact flow places an outbound call to a con-
       tact,  and  then  puts the contact in queue, the call is then routed to
       the agent, like any other inbound case.

       There is a 60-second dialing timeout for this operation. If the call is
       not connected after 60 seconds, it fails.

       NOTE:
          UK  numbers with a 447 prefix are not allowed by default. Before you
          can dial these UK mobile numbers, you must submit  a  service  quota
          increase  request.  For more information, see Amazon Connect Service
          Quotas in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide .

       NOTE:
          Campaign calls are not allowed by default. Before  you  can  make  a
          call  with  TrafficType = CAMPAIGN , you must submit a service quota
          increase request. For more information, see Amazon  Connect  Service
          Quotas in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide .

          [--client-token <value>]
          [--source-phone-number <value>]
          [--queue-id <value>]
          [--attributes <value>]
          [--answer-machine-detection-config <value>]
          [--campaign-id <value>]
          [--traffic-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]

OPTIONS
       --destination-phone-number (string)
          The phone number of the customer, in E.164 format.

       --contact-flow-id (string)
          The identifier of the contact flow for the outbound call. To see the
          ContactFlowId in the Amazon Connect console user interface,  on  the
          navigation  menu  go to Routing , Contact Flows . Choose the contact
          flow. On the contact flow page, under the name of the contact  flow,
          choose  Show  additional flow information . The ContactFlowId is the
          last part of the ARN, shown here in bold:

          arn:aws:con-
          nect:us-west-2:xxxxxxxxxxxx:instance/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/con-
          tact-flow/846ec553-a005-41c0-8341-xxxxxxxxxxxx

       --instance-id (string)
          The identifier of the Amazon Connect  instance.  You  can  find  the
          instanceId in the ARN of the instance.

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. The token is valid for 7 days after cre-
          ation.  If a contact is already started, the contact ID is returned.

       --source-phone-number (string)
          The phone number associated with the  Amazon  Connect  instance,  in
          E.164  format. If you do not specify a source phone number, you must
          specify a queue.

       --queue-id (string)
          The queue for the call. If you specify a queue, the phone  displayed
          for  caller ID is the phone number specified in the queue. If you do
          not specify a queue, the queue defined in the contact flow is  used.
          If  you do not specify a queue, you must specify a source phone num-
          ber.

       --attributes (map)
          A custom key-value pair using an attribute map. The  attributes  are
          standard  Amazon  Connect attributes, and can be accessed in contact
          flows just like any other contact attributes.

          There can be up to 32,768 UTF-8 bytes across all key-value pairs per
          contact.  Attribute  keys  can  include only alphanumeric, dash, and
          underscore characters.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --answer-machine-detection-config (structure)
          Configuration of the answering machine detection for  this  outbound
          call.

          EnableAnswerMachineDetection -> (boolean)
              The  flag to indicate if answer machine detection analysis needs
              to be performed for a voice call. If set to true  ,  TrafficType
              must be set as CAMPAIGN .

          AwaitAnswerMachinePrompt -> (boolean)
              Wait for the answering machine prompt.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          EnableAnswerMachineDetection=boolean,AwaitAnswerMachinePrompt=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "EnableAnswerMachineDetection": true|false,
            "AwaitAnswerMachinePrompt": true|false
          }

       --campaign-id (string)
          The campaign identifier of the outbound communication.

       --traffic-type (string)
          Denotes the class of traffic. Calls with different traffic types are
          handled differently by Amazon Connect. The default value is  GENERAL
          .  Use CAMPAIGN if EnableAnswerMachineDetection is set to true . For
          all other cases, use GENERAL .

          Possible values:

          o GENERAL

          o CAMPAIGN

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ContactId -> (string)
          The identifier of this contact within the Amazon Connect instance.
