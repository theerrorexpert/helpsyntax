START-CHAT-CONTACT()                                      START-CHAT-CONTACT()



NAME
       start-chat-contact -

DESCRIPTION
       Initiates a contact flow to start a new chat for the customer. Response
       of this API provides a token required to obtain  credentials  from  the
       CreateParticipantConnection  API in the Amazon Connect Participant Ser-
       vice.

       When a new chat contact is successfully created, clients must subscribe
       to  the  participants connection for the created chat within 5 minutes.
       This is achieved by invoking CreateParticipantConnection with WEBSOCKET
       and CONNECTION_CREDENTIALS.

       A 429 error occurs in the following situations:

       o API  rate  limit is exceeded. API TPS throttling returns a TooManyRe-
         quests exception.

       o The quota for concurrent active chats is exceeded. Active chat throt-
         tling returns a LimitExceededException .

       If you use the ChatDurationInMinutes parameter and receive a 400 error,
       your account may not support the ability to configure custom chat dura-
       tions. For more information, contact Amazon Web Services Support.

       For  more information about chat, see Chat in the Amazon Connect Admin-
       istrator Guide .

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The identifier of the Amazon Connect  instance.  You  can  find  the
          instanceId in the ARN of the instance.

       --contact-flow-id (string)
          The  identifier  of the contact flow for initiating the chat. To see
          the ContactFlowId in the Amazon Connect console user  interface,  on
          the  navigation menu go to Routing , Contact Flows . Choose the con-
          tact flow. On the contact flow page, under the name of  the  contact
          flow, choose Show additional flow information . The ContactFlowId is
          the last part of the ARN, shown here in bold:

          arn:aws:con-
          nect:us-west-2:xxxxxxxxxxxx:instance/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/con-
          tact-flow/846ec553-a005-41c0-8341-xxxxxxxxxxxx

       --attributes (map)
          A custom key-value pair using an attribute map. The  attributes  are
          standard  Amazon Connect attributes. They can be accessed in contact
          flows just like any other contact attributes.

          There can be up to 32,768 UTF-8 bytes across all key-value pairs per
          contact.  Attribute  keys  can  include only alphanumeric, dash, and
          underscore characters.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --participant-details (structure)
          Information identifying the participant.

          DisplayName -> (string)
              Display name of the participant.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DisplayName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "DisplayName": "string"
          }

       --initial-message (structure)
          The initial message to be sent to the newly created chat.

          ContentType -> (string)
              The type of the content. Supported types are text and plain.

          Content -> (string)
              The content of the chat message.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ContentType=string,Content=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ContentType": "string",
            "Content": "string"
          }

       --client-token (string)
          A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to  ensure  the
          idempotency of the request.

       --chat-duration-in-minutes (integer)
          The  total duration of the newly started chat session. If not speci-
          fied, the chat session duration defaults to  25  hour.  The  minumum
          configurable  time  is  60 minutes. The maximum configurable time is
          10,080 minutes (7 days).

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ContactId -> (string)
          The identifier of this contact within the Amazon Connect instance.

       ParticipantId -> (string)
          The identifier for a chat participant. The participantId for a  chat
          participant is the same throughout the chat lifecycle.

       ParticipantToken -> (string)
          The    token    used    by    the    chat    participant   to   call
          CreateParticipantConnection . The participant token is valid for the
          lifetime of a chat participant.
