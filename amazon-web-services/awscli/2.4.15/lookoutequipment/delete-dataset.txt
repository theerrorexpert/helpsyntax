DELETE-DATASET()                                              DELETE-DATASET()



NAME
       delete-dataset -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a dataset and associated artifacts. The operation will check to
       see if any inference scheduler or data ingestion job is currently using
       the  dataset,  and  if  there isn't, the dataset, its metadata, and any
       associated data stored in S3 will be deleted. This does not affect  any
       models  that  used  this  dataset for training and evaluation, but does
       prevent it from being used in the future.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-dataset
          --dataset-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dataset-name (string)
          The name of the dataset to be deleted.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
