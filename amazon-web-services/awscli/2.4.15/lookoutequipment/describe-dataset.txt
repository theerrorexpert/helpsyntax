DESCRIBE-DATASET()                                          DESCRIBE-DATASET()



NAME
       describe-dataset -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  a  JSON  description  of the data that is in each time series
       dataset, including names, column names, and data types.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-dataset
          --dataset-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dataset-name (string)
          The name of the dataset to be described.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          The name of the dataset being described.

       DatasetArn -> (string)

       CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
          Specifies the time the dataset was created  in  Amazon  Lookout  for

          Indicates the status of the dataset.

       Schema -> (string)
          A  JSON description of the data that is in each time series dataset,
          including names, column names, and data types.

       ServerSideKmsKeyId -> (string)

          by Amazon Lookout for Equipment.

       IngestionInputConfiguration -> (structure)
          Specifies  the  S3 location configuration for the data input for the
          data ingestion job.

          S3InputConfiguration -> (structure)
              The location information for the S3 bucket used for  input  data
              for the data ingestion.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  S3 bucket used for the input data for the
                 data ingestion.

              Prefix -> (string)
                 The prefix for the S3 location being used for the input  data
