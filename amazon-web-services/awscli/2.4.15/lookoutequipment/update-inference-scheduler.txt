       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-inference-scheduler
          --inference-scheduler-name <value>
          [--data-delay-offset-in-minutes <value>]
          [--data-upload-frequency <value>]
          [--data-input-configuration <value>]
          [--data-output-configuration <value>]
          [--role-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --inference-scheduler-name (string)
          The name of the inference scheduler to be updated.

       --data-delay-offset-in-minutes (long)
          A  period  of  time  (in  minutes) by which inference on the data is
          delayed after the data starts. For instance, if you select an offset
          delay  time  of  five  minutes, inference will not begin on the data
          until the first data measurement after the  five  minute  mark.  For
          example,  if  five minutes is selected, the inference scheduler will
          wake up at the configured frequency with the additional five  minute
          delay  time to check the customer S3 bucket. The customer can upload
          data at the same frequency and they don't need to stop  and  restart
          the scheduler when uploading new data.

       --data-upload-frequency (string)
          How  often  data  is  uploaded to the source S3 bucket for the input
          data. The value chosen is the length of time between  data  uploads.
          For  instance, if you select 5 minutes, Amazon Lookout for Equipment
          will upload the real-time data to the source  bucket  once  every  5
          minutes. This frequency also determines how often Amazon Lookout for
          Equipment starts a scheduled inference on your data. In  this  exam-
          ple, it starts once every 5 minutes.

          Possible values:

          o PT5M

          o PT10M

          o PT15M

          o PT30M

          o PT1H

       --data-input-configuration (structure)

          uler, including delimiter, format, and dataset location.

          S3InputConfiguration -> (structure)
              Specifies configuration information for the input data  for  the
              inference, including S3 location of input data..

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The bucket containing the input dataset for the inference.

              Prefix -> (string)
                 The  prefix for the S3 bucket used for the input data for the
                 inference.

          InputTimeZoneOffset -> (string)
              Indicates the difference between your time  zone  and  Greenwich
              Mean Time (GMT).

          InferenceInputNameConfiguration -> (structure)
              Specifies  configuration  information for the input data for the
              inference, including timestamp format and delimiter.

              TimestampFormat -> (string)
                 The format of the timestamp, whether Epoch time, or standard,
                 with or without hyphens (-).

              ComponentTimestampDelimiter -> (string)
                 Indicates  the  delimiter character used between items in the
                 data.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3InputConfiguration={Bucket=string,Prefix=string},InputTimeZoneOffset=string,InferenceInputNameConfiguration={TimestampFormat=string,ComponentTimestampDelimiter=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3InputConfiguration": {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Prefix": "string"
            },
            "InputTimeZoneOffset": "string",
            "InferenceInputNameConfiguration": {
              "TimestampFormat": "string",
              "ComponentTimestampDelimiter": "string"
            }
          }

       --data-output-configuration (structure)
          Specifies information for the  output  results  from  the  inference
          scheduler, including the output S3 location.

          S3OutputConfiguration -> (structure)
              Specifies  configuration information for the output results from
              for the inference, output S3 location.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The bucket containing the output results from the inference

              Prefix -> (string)
                 The prefix for the S3 bucket used for the output results from
                 the inference.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              The  ID number for the AWS KMS key used to encrypt the inference
              output.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3OutputConfiguration={Bucket=string,Prefix=string},KmsKeyId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3OutputConfiguration": {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Prefix": "string"
            },
            "KmsKeyId": "string"
          }

       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a role with permission  to  access
          the data source for the inference scheduler.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
