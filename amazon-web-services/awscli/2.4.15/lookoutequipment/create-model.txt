CREATE-MODEL()                                                  CREATE-MODEL()



NAME
       create-model -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an ML model for data inference.

       A  machine-learning  (ML) model is a mathematical model that finds pat-
       terns in your data. In Amazon Lookout for Equipment, the  model  learns
       the  patterns  of  normal  behavior  and detects abnormal behavior that
       could be potential equipment failure (or maintenance events). The  mod-
       els  are  made  by  analyzing  normal data and abnormalities in machine
       behavior that have already occurred.

       Your model is trained using a portion of the data from your dataset and
       uses  that  data to learn patterns of normal behavior and abnormal pat-
       terns that lead to equipment failure. Another portion of  the  data  is
       used to evaluate the model's accuracy.

          {
            "S3InputConfiguration": {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Prefix": "string"
            }
          }

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for the request. If you do not set the client
          request token, Amazon Lookout for Equipment generates one.

       --training-data-start-time (timestamp)
          Indicates the time reference in the dataset that should be  used  to
          begin the subset of training data for the ML model.

       --training-data-end-time (timestamp)
          Indicates  the  time reference in the dataset that should be used to
          end the subset of training data for the ML model.

       --evaluation-data-start-time (timestamp)
          Indicates the time reference in the dataset that should be  used  to
          begin the subset of evaluation data for the ML model.

       --evaluation-data-end-time (timestamp)
          Indicates  the  time reference in the dataset that should be used to
          end the subset of evaluation data for the ML model.

       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a role with permission  to  access
          the data source being used to create the ML model.

       --data-pre-processing-configuration (structure)
          The  configuration is the TargetSamplingRate , which is the sampling
          rate of the data after post processing by Amazon Lookout for  Equip-
          ment.  For example, if you provide data that has been collected at a
          1 second level and you want the system to resample the data at  a  1
          minute rate before training, the TargetSamplingRate is 1 minute.

          When  providing a value for the TargetSamplingRate , you must attach
          the prefix "PT" to the rate you want. The value for a 1 second  rate
          is  therefore  PT1S  , the value for a 15 minute rate is PT15M , and
          the value for a 1 hour rate is PT1H

          TargetSamplingRate -> (string)
              The sampling rate of the data after post  processing  by  Amazon
              Lookout for Equipment. For example, if you provide data that has
              been collected at a 1 second level and you want  the  system  to
              resample  the  data at a 1 minute rate before training, the Tar-
              getSamplingRate is 1 minute.

              When providing a value for the  TargetSamplingRate  ,  you  must
              attach  the  prefix "PT" to the rate you want. The value for a 1
              second rate is therefore PT1S , the value for a 15  minute  rate
              is PT15M , and the value for a 1 hour rate is PT1H

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TargetSamplingRate=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "TargetSamplingRate": "PT1S"|"PT5S"|"PT10S"|"PT15S"|"PT30S"|"PT1M"|"PT5M"|"PT10M"|"PT15M"|"PT30M"|"PT1H"
          }

       --server-side-kms-key-id (string)
          Provides the identifier of the KMS key used to encrypt model data by
          Amazon Lookout for Equipment.

       --tags (list)
          Any tags associated with the ML model being created.

          (structure)
              A tag is a key-value pair that can be added  to  a  resource  as
              metadata.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for the specified tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for the specified tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --off-condition (string)
          Indicates  that  the asset associated with this sensor has been shut
          off. As long as this condition is met, Lookout  for  Equipment  will
          not use data from this asset for training, evaluation, or inference.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ModelArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the model being created.

       Status -> (string)
          Indicates the status of the CreateModel operation.
