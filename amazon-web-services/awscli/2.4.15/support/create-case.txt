CREATE-CASE()                                                    CREATE-CASE()



NAME
       create-case -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  case in the Amazon Web Services Support Center. This opera-
       tion is similar to how you create a case in  the  Amazon  Web  Services
       Support Center Create Case page.

       The  Amazon Web Services Support API doesn't support requesting service
       limit increases. You can submit a service limit increase in the follow-
       ing ways:

       o Submit  a  request from the Amazon Web Services Support Center Create
         Case page.

       o Use the Service Quotas RequestServiceQuotaIncrease operation.

       A successful CreateCase request returns an Amazon Web Services  Support
       case  number.  You can use the  DescribeCases operation and specify the
       case number to get existing Amazon Web Services  Support  cases.  After
       you  create  a  case,  use the  AddCommunicationToCase operation to add
       additional communication or attachments to an existing case.

       The caseId is separate from the displayId that appears  in  the  Amazon
       Web  Services  Support Center . Use the  DescribeCases operation to get
       the displayId .

       NOTE:

          o You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or  Enterprise  Sup-
            port plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.

          o If  you  call  the Amazon Web Services Support API from an account
            that does not have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp,  or  Enterprise
            Support  plan,  the  SubscriptionRequiredException  error  message
            appears. For information about changing  your  support  plan,  see
            Amazon Web Services Support .

SYNOPSIS
            create-case
          --subject <value>
          [--service-code <value>]
          [--severity-code <value>]
          [--category-code <value>]
          --communication-body <value>
          [--cc-email-addresses <value>]
          [--language <value>]
          [--issue-type <value>]
          [--attachment-set-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subject (string)
          The  title  of  the  support  case. The title appears in the Subject
          field on the Amazon Web Services Support Center Create Case page.

       --service-code (string)
          The code for the Amazon  Web  Services  service.  You  can  use  the
          DescribeServices operation to get the possible serviceCode values.

       --severity-code (string)
          A  value  that  indicates the urgency of the case. This value deter-
          mines the response time according to your  service  level  agreement
          with  Amazon  Web  Services Support. You can use the  DescribeSever-
          ityLevels operation to get the possible values for severityCode .

          For more information, see  SeverityLevel and Choosing a Severity  in
          the Amazon Web Services Support User Guide .

          NOTE:
              The  availability of severity levels depends on the support plan
              for the Amazon Web Services account.

       --category-code (string)
          The category of problem for the  support  case.  You  also  use  the
          DescribeServices  operation  to get the category code for a service.
          Each Amazon Web Services service defines its  own  set  of  category
          codes.

       --communication-body (string)
          The  communication  body  text  that  describes the issue. This text
          appears in the Description field on the Amazon Web Services  Support
          Center Create Case page.

       --cc-email-addresses (list)
          A list of email addresses that Amazon Web Services Support copies on
          case correspondence. Amazon  Web  Services  Support  identifies  the
          account  that creates the case when you specify your Amazon Web Ser-
          vices credentials in an HTTP POST method or use the Amazon Web  Ser-
          vices SDKs .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --language (string)
          The  language in which Amazon Web Services Support handles the case.
          You must specify the ISO 639-1 code for the  language  parameter  if
          you  want  support  in  that language. Currently, English ("en") and
          Japanese ("ja") are supported.

       --issue-type (string)
          The type of issue for the case. You can specify customer-service  or
          technical . If you don't specify a value, the default is technical .

       --attachment-set-id (string)
          The ID of a set of one or more attachments for the case. Create  the
          set by using the  AddAttachmentsToSet operation.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a case

       The  following  create-case example creates a support case for your AWS
       account.

          aws support create-case \
              --category-code "using-aws" \
              --cc-email-addresses "myemail@example.com" \
              --communication-body "I want to learn more about an AWS service." \
              --issue-type "technical" \
              --language "en" \
              --service-code "general-info" \
              --severity-code "low" \
              --subject "Question about my account"

       Output:

          {
              "caseId": "case-12345678910-2013-c4c1d2bf33c5cf47"
          }

       Guide.

OUTPUT
       caseId -> (string)
          The  support  case ID requested or returned in the call. The case ID
          is   an   alphanumeric   string    in    the    following    format:
          case-12345678910-2013-c4c1d2bf33c5cf47
