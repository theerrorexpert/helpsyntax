DESCRIBE-SERVICES()                                        DESCRIBE-SERVICES()



NAME
       describe-services -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the current list of Amazon Web Services services and a list of
       service categories for each service. You then  use  service  names  and
       categories  in your  CreateCase requests. Each Amazon Web Services ser-
       vice has its own set of categories.

       The service codes and category codes  correspond  to  the  values  that
       appear  in  the  Service  and Category lists on the Amazon Web Services
       Support Center Create Case page. The values in those fields don't  nec-
       essarily  match  the  service  codes  and  categories  returned  by the
       DescribeServices operation. Always use the service codes and categories
       that  the DescribeServices operation returns, so that you have the most
       recent set of service and category codes.

       NOTE:

          o You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or  Enterprise  Sup-
            port plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.

          o If  you  call  the Amazon Web Services Support API from an account
            that does not have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp,  or  Enterprise
            Support  plan,  the  SubscriptionRequiredException  error  message
            appears. For information about changing  your  support  plan,  see
            Amazon Web Services Support .

SYNOPSIS
            describe-services
          [--service-code-list <value>]
          [--language <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --service-code-list (list)
          A JSON-formatted list of service codes available for Amazon Web Ser-
          vices services.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --language (string)
          The ISO 639-1 code for the language in  which  Amazon  Web  Services
          provides  support.  Amazon  Web  Services Support currently supports
          English ("en") and Japanese  ("ja").  Language  parameters  must  be
          passed explicitly for operations that take them.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       The  following  describe-services  example  lists the available service
       categories for requesting general information.
