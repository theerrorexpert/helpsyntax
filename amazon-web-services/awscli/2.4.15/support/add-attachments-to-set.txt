ADD-ATTACHMENTS-TO-SET()                              ADD-ATTACHMENTS-TO-SET()



NAME
       add-attachments-to-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds one or more attachments to an attachment set.

       An attachment set is a temporary container for attachments that you add
       to a case or case communication. The set is available for 1 hour  after
       it's  created.  The expiryTime returned in the response is when the set
       expires.

       NOTE:

          o You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or  Enterprise  Sup-
            port plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.

          o If  you  call  the Amazon Web Services Support API from an account
            that does not have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp,  or  Enterprise
            Support  plan,  the  SubscriptionRequiredException  error  message
            appears. For information about changing  your  support  plan,  see
            Amazon Web Services Support .

SYNOPSIS
            add-attachments-to-set
          [--attachment-set-id <value>]
          --attachments <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --attachment-set-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the attachment set. If an attachmentSetId is not speci-
          fied, a new attachment set is created, and the  ID  of  the  set  is
          returned  in  the  response. If an attachmentSetId is specified, the
          attachments are added to the specified set, if it exists.

       --attachments (list)
          One or more attachments to add to the set. You can add up  to  three
          attachments per set. The size limit is 5 MB per attachment.

          In the Attachment object, use the data parameter to specify the con-
          tents of the attachment file. In the previous  request  syntax,  the
          value  for  data  appear  as  blob  ,  which  is  represented  as  a
          base64-encoded string. The value for fileName is  the  name  of  the
          attachment, such as troubleshoot-screenshot.png .

          (structure)
              An  attachment  to a case communication. The attachment consists
              of the file name and the content of the file.

              fileName -> (string)
                 The name of the attachment file.

              data -> (blob)
                 The content of the attachment file.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          fileName=string,data=blob ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "fileName": "string",
              "data": blob
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To add an attachment to a set

       The following add-attachments-to-set example adds an  image  to  a  set
       that you can then specify for a support case in your AWS account.

          aws support add-attachments-to-set \
              --attachment-set-id "as-2f5a6faa2a4a1e600-mu-nk5xQlBr70-G1cUos5LZkd38KOAHZa9BMDVzNEXAMPLE" \
              --attachments fileName=troubleshoot-screenshot.png,data=base64-encoded-string

       Output:

          {
              "attachmentSetId": "as-2f5a6faa2a4a1e600-mu-nk5xQlBr70-G1cUos5LZkd38KOAHZa9BMDVzNEXAMPLE",
              "expiryTime": "2020-05-14T17:04:40.790+0000"
          }

       For  more  information,  see  Case  management  in the AWS Support User
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       attachmentSetId -> (string)
          The ID of the attachment set. If an attachmentSetId was  not  speci-
          fied,  a  new  attachment  set  is created, and the ID of the set is
          returned in the response. If an attachmentSetId was  specified,  the
          attachments are added to the specified set, if it exists.

       expiryTime -> (string)
          The time and date when the attachment set expires.
