NAME
       describe-trusted-advisor-check-refresh-statuses -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the refresh status of the Trusted Advisor checks that have the
       specified check IDs. You can get the check IDs by calling the   Descri-
       beTrustedAdvisorChecks operation.

       Some  checks  are  refreshed  automatically, and you can't return their
       refresh statuses by  using  the  DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshSta-
       tuses operation. If you call this operation for these checks, you might
       see an InvalidParameterValue error.

       NOTE:

          o You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or  Enterprise  Sup-
            port plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.

          o If  you  call  the Amazon Web Services Support API from an account
            that does not have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp,  or  Enterprise
            Support  plan,  the  SubscriptionRequiredException  error  message
            appears. For information about changing  your  support  plan,  see
            Amazon Web Services Support .

SYNOPSIS
            describe-trusted-advisor-check-refresh-statuses
          --check-ids <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --check-ids (list)
          The IDs of the Trusted Advisor checks to get the status.

          NOTE:
              If  you  specify  the  check ID of a check that is automatically
              refreshed, you might see an InvalidParameterValue error.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the refresh statuses of AWS Trusted Advisor checks

       The following  describe-trusted-advisor-check-refresh-statuses  example
       lists  the  refresh  statuses for two Trusted Advisor checks: Amazon S3
       Bucket Permissions and IAM Use.

          aws support describe-trusted-advisor-check-refresh-statuses \
              --check-id "Pfx0RwqBli" "zXCkfM1nI3"

       Output:

          {
              "statuses": [
                  {
                      "checkId": "Pfx0RwqBli",
                      "status": "none",
                      "millisUntilNextRefreshable": 0
                  },
                  {
                      "checkId": "zXCkfM1nI3",
                      "status": "none",
                      "millisUntilNextRefreshable": 0
                  }
              ]
          }

              checkId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the Trusted Advisor check.

              status -> (string)
                 The  status  of the Trusted Advisor check for which a refresh
                 has been requested:

                 o none - The check is not refreshed or the non-success status
                   exceeds the timeout

              millisUntilNextRefreshable -> (long)
