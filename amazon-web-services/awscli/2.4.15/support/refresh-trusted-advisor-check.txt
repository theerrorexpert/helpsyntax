REFRESH-TRUSTED-ADVISOR-CHECK()                REFRESH-TRUSTED-ADVISOR-CHECK()



NAME
       refresh-trusted-advisor-check -

DESCRIPTION
       Refreshes  the  Trusted  Advisor check that you specify using the check
       ID. You can get the check IDs by calling  the   DescribeTrustedAdvisor-
       Checks operation.

       NOTE:
          Some   checks   are   refreshed   automatically.  If  you  call  the
          RefreshTrustedAdvisorCheck operation to refresh them, you might  see
          the InvalidParameterValue error.

       The response contains a  TrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatus object.

       NOTE:

          o You  must  have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Sup-
            port plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.

          o If you call the Amazon Web Services Support API  from  an  account
            that  does  not have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise
            Support  plan,  the  SubscriptionRequiredException  error  message
            appears.  For  information  about  changing your support plan, see
            Amazon Web Services Support .

SYNOPSIS
            refresh-trusted-advisor-check
          --check-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --check-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the Trusted Advisor check to refresh.

          NOTE:
              Specifying the  check  ID  of  a  check  that  is  automatically
              refreshed causes an InvalidParameterValue error.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
