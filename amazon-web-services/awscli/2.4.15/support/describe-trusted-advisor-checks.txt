NAME
       describe-trusted-advisor-checks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about all available Trusted Advisor checks, includ-
       ing the name, ID, category, description, and metadata. You must specify
       a language code. The Amazon Web Services Support API currently supports
       English ("en") and Japanese ("ja"). The response contains a  TrustedAd-
       visorCheckDescription  object  for  each check. You must set the Amazon
       Web Services Region to us-east-1.

       NOTE:

          o You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or  Enterprise  Sup-
            port plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.

          o If  you  call  the Amazon Web Services Support API from an account
            that does not have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp,  or  Enterprise
            Support  plan,  the  SubscriptionRequiredException  error  message
            appears. For information about changing  your  support  plan,  see
            Amazon Web Services Support .

          o The  names and descriptions for Trusted Advisor checks are subject
            to change. We recommend that you specify the check ID in your code
            to uniquely identify a check.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-trusted-advisor-checks
          --language <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --language (string)
          The  ISO  639-1  code  for the language in which Amazon Web Services
          provides support. Amazon Web  Services  Support  currently  supports
          English  ("en")  and  Japanese  ("ja").  Language parameters must be
          passed explicitly for operations that take them.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 data that is shown in the Excel download, even in those cases
                 where the UI shows just summary data.
