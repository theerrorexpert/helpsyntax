DESCRIBE-SEVERITY-LEVELS()                          DESCRIBE-SEVERITY-LEVELS()



NAME
       describe-severity-levels -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  list  of severity levels that you can assign to a support
       case. The severity level for a case is also a field in the  CaseDetails
       data type that you include for a  CreateCase request.

       NOTE:

          o You  must  have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Sup-
            port plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.

          o If you call the Amazon Web Services Support API  from  an  account
            that  does  not have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise
            Support  plan,  the  SubscriptionRequiredException  error  message
            appears.  For  information  about  changing your support plan, see
            Amazon Web Services Support .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-severity-levels
          [--language <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --language (string)
          The ISO 639-1 code for the language in  which  Amazon  Web  Services
          provides  support.  Amazon  Web  Services Support currently supports
          English ("en") and Japanese  ("ja").  Language  parameters  must  be
          passed explicitly for operations that take them.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the available severity levels

       The  following  describe-severity-levels  example  lists  the available
       severity levels for a support case.

          aws support describe-severity-levels

       Output:

          {
              "severityLevels": [
                  {
                      "code": "low",
                      "name": "Low"
                  },
                  {
                      "code": "normal",
                      "name": "Normal"
                  },
                  {
                      "code": "high",
                      "name": "High"
                  },
                  {
                      "code": "urgent",
                      "name": "Urgent"
                  },
                  {
                      "code": "critical",
                      "name": "Critical"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Guide.

OUTPUT
       severityLevels -> (list)
          The available severity levels for the support case. Available sever-
          ity levels are defined by your service level agreement  with  Amazon
          Web Services.

          (structure)
              A  code  and  name  pair that represents the severity level of a
              support case. The available values depend on  the  support  plan
              for  the  account. For more information, see Choosing a severity
              in the Amazon Web Services Support User Guide .

              code -> (string)
                 The code for case severity level.

                 Valid values: low | normal | high | urgent | critical

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the severity level that corresponds to the sever-
                 ity level code.

                 NOTE:
                     The  values  returned  by  the API are different from the
                     values that appear in the  Amazon  Web  Services  Support
                     Center.  For example, the API uses the code low , but the
                     name appears as General guidance in Support Center.

                     The following are the API code names and how they  appear
                     in the console:

                     o low - General guidance

                     o normal - System impaired

                     o high - Production system impaired

                     o urgent - Production system down

                     o critical - Business-critical system down

                 For  more  information, see Choosing a severity in the Amazon
                 Web Services Support User Guide .
