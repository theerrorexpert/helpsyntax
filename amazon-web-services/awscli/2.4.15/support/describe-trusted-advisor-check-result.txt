NAME
       describe-trusted-advisor-check-result -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the results of the Trusted Advisor check that has the specified
       check ID. You can get the check IDs by calling the   DescribeTrustedAd-
       visorChecks operation.

       The  response  contains a  TrustedAdvisorCheckResult object, which con-
       tains these three objects:

       o TrustedAdvisorCategorySpecificSummary

       o TrustedAdvisorResourceDetail

       o TrustedAdvisorResourcesSummary

       In addition, the response contains these fields:

       o status - The alert status of the check can  be  ok  (green),  warning
         (yellow), error (red), or not_available .

       o timestamp - The time of the last refresh of the check.

       o checkId - The unique identifier for the check.

       NOTE:

          o You  must  have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Sup-
            port plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.

          o If you call the Amazon Web Services Support API  from  an  account
            that  does  not have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise
            Support  plan,  the  SubscriptionRequiredException  error  message
            appears.  For  information  about  changing your support plan, see
            Amazon Web Services Support .

SYNOPSIS
            describe-trusted-advisor-check-result
          --check-id <value>
          [--language <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --check-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the Trusted Advisor check.

       --language (string)
          The ISO 639-1 code for the language in  which  Amazon  Web  Services
          provides  support.  Amazon  Web  Services Support currently supports
          English ("en") and Japanese  ("ja").  Language  parameters  must  be
          passed explicitly for operations that take them.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
