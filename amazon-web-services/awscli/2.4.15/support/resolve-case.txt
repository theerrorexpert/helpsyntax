NAME
       resolve-case -

DESCRIPTION
       Resolves  a support case. This operation takes a caseId and returns the
       initial and final state of the case.

       NOTE:

          o You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or  Enterprise  Sup-
            port plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.

          o If  you  call  the Amazon Web Services Support API from an account
            that does not have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp,  or  Enterprise
            Support  plan,  the  SubscriptionRequiredException  error  message
            appears. For information about changing  your  support  plan,  see
            Amazon Web Services Support .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            resolve-case
          [--case-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --case-id (string)
          The  support  case ID requested or returned in the call. The case ID
          is an alphanumeric  string  formatted  as  shown  in  this  example:
          case-12345678910-2013-c4c1d2bf33c5cf47

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To resolve a support case

       The  following resolve-case example resolves a support case in your AWS
       account.

          aws support resolve-case \
              --case-id "case-12345678910-2013-c4c1d2bf33c5cf47"

       Output:

          {
              "finalCaseStatus": "resolved",
              "initialCaseStatus": "work-in-progress"
          }

       For more information, see Case  management  in  the  AWS  Support  User
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       initialCaseStatus -> (string)
          The status of the case when the  ResolveCase request was sent.

       finalCaseStatus -> (string)
          The status of the case after the  ResolveCase request was processed.
