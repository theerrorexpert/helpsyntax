DESCRIBE-CASES()                                              DESCRIBE-CASES()



NAME
       describe-cases -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of cases that you specify by passing one or more case
       IDs. You can use the afterTime and beforeTime parameters to filter  the
       cases  by  date.  You  can  set values for the includeResolvedCases and
       includeCommunications parameters to specify  how  much  information  to
       return.

       The response returns the following in JSON format:

       o One or more CaseDetails data types.

       o One  or  more  nextToken  values, which specify where to paginate the
         returned records represented by the CaseDetails objects.

       Case data is available for 12 months after creation. If a case was cre-
       ated more than 12 months ago, a request might return an error.

       NOTE:

          o You  must  have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Sup-
            port plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.

          o If you call the Amazon Web Services Support API  from  an  account
            that  does  not have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise
            Support  plan,  the  SubscriptionRequiredException  error  message
            appears.  For  information  about  changing your support plan, see
            Amazon Web Services Support .

       describe-cases is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: cases

SYNOPSIS
            describe-cases
          [--case-id-list <value>]
          [--display-id <value>]
          [--after-time <value>]
          [--before-time <value>]
          [--include-resolved-cases | --no-include-resolved-cases]
          [--language <value>]
          [--include-communications | --no-include-communications]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --case-id-list (list)
          A  list  of  ID  numbers of the support cases you want returned. The
          maximum number of cases is 100.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --display-id (string)
          The ID displayed for a case in the Amazon Web Services Support  Cen-
          ter user interface.

       --after-time (string)
          The start date for a filtered date search on support case communica-
          tions. Case communications are available for 12  months  after  cre-
          ation.

       --before-time (string)
          The  end  date for a filtered date search on support case communica-
          tions. Case communications are available for 12  months  after  cre-
          ation.

       --include-resolved-cases | --no-include-resolved-cases (boolean)
          Specifies   whether   to  include  resolved  support  cases  in  the
          DescribeCases response. By default, resolved cases aren't  included.

       --language (string)
          The  ISO  639-1  code  for the language in which Amazon Web Services
          provides support. Amazon Web  Services  Support  currently  supports
          English  ("en")  and  Japanese  ("ja").  Language parameters must be
          passed explicitly for operations that take them.

       --include-communications | --no-include-communications (boolean)
          Specifies whether to include  communications  in  the  DescribeCases
          response. By default, communications are included.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       The following describe-cases  example  returns  information  about  the

                               operation.
