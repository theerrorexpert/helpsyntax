DESCRIBE-ATTACHMENT()                                    DESCRIBE-ATTACHMENT()



NAME
       describe-attachment -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  attachment  that  has  the  specified ID. Attachments can
       include screenshots, error logs, or  other  files  that  describe  your
       issue.  Attachment IDs are generated by the case management system when
       you add an attachment to a case or case communication.  Attachment  IDs
       are returned in the  AttachmentDetails objects that are returned by the
       DescribeCommunications operation.

       NOTE:

          o You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or  Enterprise  Sup-
            port plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.

          o If  you  call  the Amazon Web Services Support API from an account
            that does not have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp,  or  Enterprise
            Support  plan,  the  SubscriptionRequiredException  error  message
            appears. For information about changing  your  support  plan,  see
            Amazon Web Services Support .

SYNOPSIS
            describe-attachment
          --attachment-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --attachment-id (string)
          The  ID  of the attachment to return. Attachment IDs are returned by
          the  DescribeCommunications operation.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       The following describe-attachment example returns information about the
       attachment with the specified ID.

          aws support describe-attachment \
              --attachment-id "attachment-KBnjRNrePd9D6Jx0-Mm00xZuDEaL2JAj_0-gJv9qqDooTipsz3V1Nb19rCfkZneeQeDPgp8X1iVJyHH7UuhZDdNeqGoduZsPrAhyMakqlc60-iJjL5HqyYGiT1FG8EXAMPLE"

       Output:

          {
              "attachment": {
                  "fileName": "troubleshoot-screenshot.png",
                  "data": "base64-blob"
              }
