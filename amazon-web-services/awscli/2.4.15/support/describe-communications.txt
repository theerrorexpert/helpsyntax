DESCRIBE-COMMUNICATIONS()                            DESCRIBE-COMMUNICATIONS()



NAME
       describe-communications -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  communications  and attachments for one or more support cases.
       Use the afterTime and beforeTime parameters to filter by date. You  can
       use the caseId parameter to restrict the results to a specific case.

       Case data is available for 12 months after creation. If a case was cre-
       ated more than 12 months ago, a request for data might cause an  error.

       You can use the maxResults and nextToken parameters to control the pag-
       ination of the results. Set maxResults to the number of cases that  you
       want  to display on each page, and use nextToken to specify the resump-
       tion of pagination.

       NOTE:

          o You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or  Enterprise  Sup-
            port plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.

          o If  you  call  the Amazon Web Services Support API from an account
            that does not have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp,  or  Enterprise
            Support  plan,  the  SubscriptionRequiredException  error  message
            appears. For information about changing  your  support  plan,  see
            Amazon Web Services Support .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-communications  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: communications

SYNOPSIS
            describe-communications
          --case-id <value>
          [--before-time <value>]
          [--after-time <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --case-id (string)
          The support case ID requested or returned in the call. The  case  ID
          is  an  alphanumeric  string  formatted  as  shown  in this example:
          case-12345678910-2013-c4c1d2bf33c5cf47

       --before-time (string)
          The end date for a filtered date search on support  case  communica-
          tions.  Case  communications  are available for 12 months after cre-
          ation.

       --after-time (string)
          The start date for a filtered date search on support case communica-
          tions.  Case  communications  are available for 12 months after cre-
          ation.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe the latest communication for a case

       The following describe-communications example returns the latest commu-
       nication for the specified support case in your AWS account.

          aws support describe-communications \
              --case-id "case-12345678910-2013-c4c1d2bf33c5cf47" \
              --after-time "2020-03-23T21:31:47.774Z" \
              --max-item 1

       Output:

          {
              "communications": [
                  {
                      "body": "I want to learn more about an AWS service.",
                      "attachmentSet": [],
                      "caseId": "case-12345678910-2013-c4c1d2bf33c5cf47",
                      "timeCreated": "2020-05-12T23:12:35.000Z",
                      "submittedBy": "Amazon Web Services"
                  }
              ],
              "NextToken": "eyJuZXh0VG9rZW4iOiBudWxsLCAiYm90b190cnVuY2F0ZV9hbW91bnQEXAMPLE=="
          }

              information,  the  submitter  of the communication, and the date
              and time of the communication.

              caseId -> (string)
                 The support case ID requested or returned in  the  call.  The
                 case  ID is an alphanumeric string formatted as shown in this
                 example: case-12345678910-2013-c4c1d2bf33c5cf47

              body -> (string)
                 The text of the communication between the customer and Amazon

                 The  identity of the account that submitted, or responded to,
                 the support case. Customer entries include the  role  or  IAM
                 user  as  well  as the email address. For example, "AdminRole
                 (Role) <janedoe@example.com>. Entries  from  the  Amazon  Web
                 Services  Support  team  display  "Amazon  Web Services," and
                 don't show an email address.

              timeCreated -> (string)
                 The time the communication was created.

              attachmentSet -> (list)

                     The  file name and ID of an attachment to a case communi-
                     cation. You can use the ID  to  retrieve  the  attachment
                     with the  DescribeAttachment operation.
