CREATE-SCHEDULED-QUERY()                              CREATE-SCHEDULED-QUERY()



NAME
       create-scheduled-query -

DESCRIPTION
       Create a scheduled query that will be run on your behalf at the config-
       ured schedule. Timestream assumes the execution role provided  as  part
       of  the  ScheduledQueryExecutionRoleArn parameter to run the query. You
       can use the NotificationConfiguration parameter to configure  notifica-
       tion for your scheduled query operations.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-scheduled-query
          --name <value>
          --query-string <value>
          --schedule-configuration <value>
          --notification-configuration <value>
          [--target-configuration <value>]
          [--client-token <value>]
          --scheduled-query-execution-role-arn <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--kms-key-id <value>]
          --error-report-configuration <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          Name of the scheduled query.

       --query-string (string)
          The  query  string  to  run. Parameter names can be specified in the
          query string @ character followed by an identifier. The named Param-
          eter  @scheduled_runtime is reserved and can be used in the query to
          get the time at which the query is scheduled to run.

          The timestamp  calculated  according  to  the  ScheduleConfiguration
          parameter,  will  be  the  value of @scheduled_runtime paramater for
          each query run. For example, consider an  instance  of  a  scheduled
          query  executing  on  2021-12-01  00:00:00.  For  this instance, the
          @scheduled_runtime  parameter  is  initialized  to   the   timestamp
          2021-12-01 00:00:00 when invoking the query.

       --schedule-configuration (structure)
          The schedule configuration for the query.

          ScheduleExpression -> (string)

       --notification-configuration (structure)
          Notification configuration for the scheduled query.  A  notification
          is  sent  by Timestream when a query run finishes, when the state is
          updated or when you delete it.

          SnsConfiguration -> (structure)

                        vided.

                     SourceColumn -> (string)
                        This field refers to the source column from which mea-

       --client-token (string)
          Using a ClientToken makes the call to  CreateScheduledQuery  idempo-
          tent,  in  other words, making the same request repeatedly will pro-
          duce the same result. Making multiple identical CreateScheduledQuery
          requests has the same effect as making a single request.

          o If  CreateScheduledQuery  is  called  without  a ClientToken , the
            Query SDK generates a ClientToken on your behalf.

          o After 8 hours, any request with the same ClientToken is treated as
            a new request.

       --scheduled-query-execution-role-arn (string)
          The  ARN  for  the IAM role that Timestream will assume when running
          the scheduled query.

       --tags (list)
          A list of key-value pairs to label the scheduled query.

          (structure)
              A tag is a label that you assign to a Timestream database and/or
              table. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of
              which you define. Tags enable you to categorize databases and/or
              tables, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag. Tag keys are case sensitive.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value  of the tag. Tag values are case sensitive and can
                 be null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon KMS key used to encrypt  the  scheduled  query  resource,
          at-rest. If the Amazon KMS key is not specified, the scheduled query
          resource will be encrypted with a Timestream owned Amazon  KMS  key.
          To  specify a KMS key, use the key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias
          ARN. When using an alias name, prefix the name with alias/

          If ErrorReportConfiguration uses SSE_KMS  as  encryption  type,  the
          same KmsKeyId is used to encrypt the error report at rest.

       --error-report-configuration (structure)
          Configuration  for  error reporting. Error reports will be generated
          when a problem is encountered when writing the query results.

          S3Configuration -> (structure)
              The S3 configuration for the error reports.

              BucketName -> (string)
                 Name of the S3 bucket under which error reports will be  cre-
                 ated.

              ObjectKeyPrefix -> (string)
                 Prefix  for  the error report key. Timestream by default adds
                 the following prefix to the error report path.

              EncryptionOption -> (string)
                 Encryption at rest options  for  the  error  reports.  If  no
                 encryption option is specified, Timestream will choose SSE_S3
                 as default.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Configuration={BucketName=string,ObjectKeyPrefix=string,EncryptionOption=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Configuration": {
              "BucketName": "string",
              "ObjectKeyPrefix": "string",
              "EncryptionOption": "SSE_S3"|"SSE_KMS"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          ARN for the created scheduled query.
