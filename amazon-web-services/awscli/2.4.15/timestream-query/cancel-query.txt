CANCEL-QUERY()                                                  CANCEL-QUERY()



NAME
       cancel-query -

DESCRIPTION
       Cancels  a query that has been issued. Cancellation is provided only if
       the query has not completed running before the cancellation request was
       issued.  Because  cancellation  is  an idempotent operation, subsequent
       cancellation requests will return a  CancellationMessage  ,  indicating
       that  the query has already been canceled. See code sample for details.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            cancel-query
          --query-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --query-id (string)
          The ID of the query that needs to be cancelled. QueryID is  returned
          as part of the query result.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CancellationMessage -> (string)
          A CancellationMessage is returned when a CancelQuery request for the
          query specified by QueryId has already been issued.
