QUERY()                                                                QUERY()



NAME
       query -

DESCRIPTION
          Query  is  a  synchronous  operation that enables you to run a query
          against your Amazon Timestream data. Query will time  out  after  60
          seconds. You must update the default timeout in the SDK to support a
          timeout of 60 seconds. See the code sample for details.

       Your query request will fail in the following cases:

       o If you submit a Query request with the same client token  outside  of
         the 5-minute idempotency window.

       o If  you submit a Query request with the same client token, but change
         other parameters, within the 5-minute idempotency window.

       o If the size of the row (including the query metadata) exceeds  1  MB,
         then  the  query  will fail with the following error message:   Query
         aborted as max page response size has been  exceeded  by  the  output
         result row

       o If the IAM principal of the query initiator and the result reader are
         not the same and/or the query initiator and the result reader do  not
         have the same query string in the query requests, the query will fail
         with an Invalid pagination token error.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       query is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may  be  issued  in
       order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagi-
       nation by providing the --no-paginate argument.   When  using  --output
       text  and  the  --query  argument  on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the  results  of  the  following  query
       expressions: Rows

SYNOPSIS
            query
          --query-string <value>
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --query-string (string)
          The query to be run by Timestream.

       --client-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive string of up to 64 ASCII characters specified
          when a Query request is made. Providing a ClientToken makes the call
          to  Query   idempotent  .  This  means  that  running the same query
          repeatedly will produce the same result. In other words, making mul-
          tiple  identical Query requests has the same effect as making a sin-
          gle request. When using ClientToken in a query, note the following:

          o If the Query API is instantiated without a ClientToken , the Query
            SDK generates a ClientToken on your behalf.

          o If the Query invocation only contains the ClientToken but does not
            include a NextToken , that invocation of Query is assumed to be  a
            new query run.

          o If  the invocation contains NextToken , that particular invocation
            is assumed to be a subsequent invocation of a prior  call  to  the
            Query API, and a result set is returned.

          o After 4 hours, any request with the same ClientToken is treated as
            a new request.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                        except for arrays.

                     Type -> (structure)
                        The data type of the result set column. The data  type
                        can  be  a  scalar  or  complex. Scalar data types are
                        integers, strings, doubles, Booleans, and others. Com-
                        plex  data  types  are types such as arrays, rows, and
                        others.

                        ScalarType -> (string)
                            Indicates if the column is of type  string,  inte-
                            ger, Boolean, double, timestamp, date, time.

                        (  ...  recursive ... )( ... recursive ... )RowColumn-
                        Info -> (list)
                            Indicates if the column is a row.

                            ( ... recursive ... )

                 RowColumnInfo -> (list)
                     Indicates if the column is a row.

                     (structure)
                        Contains the metadata for query results  such  as  the
                        column names, data types, and other attributes.

                        Name -> (string)
                            The name of the result set column. The name of the
                            result set is available for columns  of  all  data
                            types except for arrays.

                        Type -> (structure)
                            The  data  type of the result set column. The data
                            type can be a scalar or complex. Scalar data types
                            are integers, strings, doubles, Booleans, and oth-
                            ers. Complex data types are types such as  arrays,
                            rows, and others.

                            ScalarType -> (string)
                               Indicates  if  the  column  is  of type string,
                               integer,  Boolean,  double,  timestamp,   date,
                               time.

                            ( ... recursive ... )( ... recursive ... )

       QueryStatus -> (structure)
          Information  about  the  status of the query, including progress and
          bytes scanned.

          ProgressPercentage -> (double)
              The progress of the query, expressed as a percentage.

          CumulativeBytesScanned -> (long)
              The amount of data scanned by the query  in  bytes.  This  is  a
              cumulative  sum and represents the total amount of bytes scanned
              since the query was started.

          CumulativeBytesMetered -> (long)
              The amount of data scanned by the query in bytes that  you  will
              be  charged  for.  This  is  a cumulative sum and represents the
              total amount of data that you will  be  charged  for  since  the
              query was started. The charge is applied only once and is either
              applied when the query completes running or when  the  query  is
              cancelled.
