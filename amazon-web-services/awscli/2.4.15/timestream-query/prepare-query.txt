PREPARE-QUERY()                                                PREPARE-QUERY()



NAME
       prepare-query -

DESCRIPTION
       A  synchronous operation that allows you to submit a query with parame-
       ters to be stored by Timestream for later running. Timestream only sup-
       ports  using  this  operation with the PrepareQueryRequest$ValidateOnly
       set to true .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            prepare-query
          --query-string <value>
          [--validate-only | --no-validate-only]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --query-string (string)
          The Timestream query string that you  want  to  use  as  a  prepared
          statement.  Parameter  names  can be specified in the query string @
          character followed by an identifier.

       --validate-only | --no-validate-only (boolean)
          By setting this value to true , Timestream will only  validate  that
          the query string is a valid Timestream query, and not store the pre-
          pared query for later use.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
