OPTIONS
       --cluster (string)
          The short name or full ARN of the cluster that hosts the  container.

       --task (string)
          The  task  ID  or  full  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task that
          hosts the container.

       --container-name (string)
          The name of the container.

       --runtime-id (string)
          The ID of the Docker container.

       --status (string)
          The status of the state change request.

       --exit-code (integer)
          The exit code that's returned for the state change request.

       --reason (string)
          The reason for the state change request.

       --network-bindings (list)
          The network bindings of the container.

          (structure)
              Details on the network bindings between a container and its host
              container  instance.  After  a  task reaches the RUNNING status,
              manual and automatic host and  container  port  assignments  are
              visible  in  the  networkBindings  section of  DescribeTasks API
              responses.

              bindIP -> (string)
                 The IP address that the container is bound  to  on  the  con-
                 tainer instance.

              containerPort -> (integer)
                 The port number on the container that's used with the network
                 binding.

              hostPort -> (integer)
                 The port number on the host  that's  used  with  the  network
                 binding.

              protocol -> (string)
                 The protocol used for the network binding.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          bindIP=string,containerPort=integer,hostPort=integer,protocol=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "bindIP": "string",
              "containerPort": integer,
              "hostPort": integer,
              "protocol": "tcp"|"udp"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       acknowledgment -> (string)
          Acknowledgement of the state change.
