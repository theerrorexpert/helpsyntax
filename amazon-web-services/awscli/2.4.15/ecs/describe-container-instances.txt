NAME
       describe-container-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  one or more container instances. Returns metadata about each
       container instance requested.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-container-instances
          [--cluster <value>]
          --container-instances <value>
          [--include <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster (string)
          The short name or full Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the  cluster
          that  hosts the container instances to describe. If you do not spec-
          ify a cluster, the default cluster is  assumed.  This  parameter  is
          required  if  the  container instance or container instances you are
          describing were launched in any cluster other than the default clus-
          ter.

       --container-instances (list)
          A  list  of up to 100 container instance IDs or full Amazon Resource
          Name (ARN) entries.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --include (list)
          Specifies whether you want to see the resource  tags  for  the  con-
          tainer  instance. If TAGS is specified, the tags are included in the
          response. If CONTAINER_INSTANCE_HEALTH is specified,  the  container
          instance  health is included in the response. If this field is omit-
          ted, tags and container instance health status  aren't  included  in
          the response.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            TAGS
            CONTAINER_INSTANCE_HEALTH

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe container instance

       The  following  describe-container-instances  example retrieves details
       for a container instance in the update  cluster,  using  the  container
       instance UUID as an identifier.

          aws ecs describe-container-instances \
              --cluster update \
              --container-instances a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-11111EXAMPLE

OUTPUT
       containerInstances -> (list)
          The list of container instances.

          (structure)
              An EC2 instance that's running the Amazon ECS agent and has been
              registered with a cluster.

              containerInstanceArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the container instance. The
                 ARN contains  the  arn:aws:ecs  namespace,  followed  by  the
                 Region  of  the  container  instance, the Amazon Web Services
                 account  ID  of  the  container  instance  owner,  the   con-
                 tainer-instance  namespace,  and  then the container instance
                 ID.   For   example,   arn:aws:ecs:region:aws_account_id:con-
                 tainer-instance/container_instance_ID .

              ec2InstanceId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of the container instance. For Amazon EC2 instances,
                 this value is  the  Amazon  EC2  instance  ID.  For  external
                 instances, this value is the Amazon Web Services Systems Man-
                 ager managed instance ID.

              capacityProviderName -> (string)
                 The capacity provider that's associated  with  the  container
                 instance.

              version -> (long)
                 The  version counter for the container instance. Every time a
                 container instance  experiences  a  change  that  triggers  a
                 CloudWatch  event,  the  version  counter  is incremented. If
                 you're replicating your Amazon ECS container  instance  state
                 with CloudWatch Events, you can compare the version of a con-
                 tainer instance reported by the Amazon ECS APIs with the ver-
                 sion reported in CloudWatch Events for the container instance
                 (inside the detail object) to verify that the version in your
                 event stream is current.

              versionInfo -> (structure)
                 The  version  information  for the Amazon ECS container agent
                 and Docker daemon running on the container instance.

                 agentVersion -> (string)
                     The version number of the Amazon ECS container agent.

                 agentHash -> (string)
                     The Git commit hash for the Amazon  ECS  container  agent
                     build on the amazon-ecs-agent GitHub repository.

                 dockerVersion -> (string)
                     The  Docker  version  that's  running  on  the  container
                     instance.

              remainingResources -> (list)
                 For CPU and memory resource types, this  parameter  describes
                 the remaining CPU and memory that wasn't already allocated to
                 tasks and is therefore available  for  new  tasks.  For  port
                 resource  types, this parameter describes the ports that were
                 reserved by the Amazon ECS container agent (at instance  reg-
                 istration  time)  and  any task containers that have reserved
                 port mappings on the host (with the host  or  bridge  network
                 mode).  Any  port  that's not specified here is available for
                 new tasks.

                 (structure)
                     Describes  the  resources  available  for   a   container
                     instance.

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of the resource, such as CPU , MEMORY , PORTS
                        , PORTS_UDP , or a user-defined resource.

                     type -> (string)
                        The type of the resource. Valid values: INTEGER , DOU-
                        BLE , LONG , or STRINGSET .

                     doubleValue -> (double)
                        When  the  doubleValue  type  is set, the value of the
                        resource must be  a  double  precision  floating-point
                        type.

                     longValue -> (long)
                        When  the  longValue  type  is  set,  the value of the
                        resource must be an extended precision  floating-point
                        type.

                     integerValue -> (integer)
                        When  the  integerValue  type is set, the value of the
                        resource must be an integer.

                     stringSetValue -> (list)
                        When the stringSetValue type is set, the value of  the
                        resource must be a string type.

                        (string)

              registeredResources -> (list)
                 For  CPU  and memory resource types, this parameter describes
                 the amount of each resource that was available  on  the  con-
                 tainer  instance  when the container agent registered it with
                 Amazon ECS. This value represents the total amount of CPU and
                 memory  that  can  be allocated on this container instance to
                 tasks. For port resource types, this parameter describes  the
                 ports  that  were  reserved by the Amazon ECS container agent
                 when it registered the container instance with Amazon ECS.

                 (structure)
                     Describes  the  resources  available  for   a   container
                     instance.

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of the resource, such as CPU , MEMORY , PORTS
                        , PORTS_UDP , or a user-defined resource.

                     type -> (string)
                        The type of the resource. Valid values: INTEGER , DOU-
                        BLE , LONG , or STRINGSET .

                     doubleValue -> (double)
                        When  the  doubleValue  type  is set, the value of the
                        resource must be  a  double  precision  floating-point
                        type.

                     longValue -> (long)
                        When  the  longValue  type  is  set,  the value of the
                        resource must be an extended precision  floating-point
                        type.

                     integerValue -> (integer)
                        When  the  integerValue  type is set, the value of the
                        resource must be an integer.

                     stringSetValue -> (list)
                        When the stringSetValue type is set, the value of  the
                        resource must be a string type.

                        (string)

              status -> (string)
                 The  status  of  the container instance. The valid values are
                 REGISTERING ,  REGISTRATION_FAILED  ,  ACTIVE  ,  INACTIVE  ,
                 DEREGISTERING , or DRAINING .

                 If  your  account  has opted in to the awsvpcTrunking account
                 setting, then any newly registered  container  instance  will
                 transition  to  a  REGISTERING status while the trunk elastic
                 network interface is provisioned for  the  instance.  If  the
                 registration  fails, the instance will transition to a REGIS-
                 TRATION_FAILED  status.  You  can  describe   the   container
                 instance  and  see the reason for failure in the statusReason
                 parameter. Once the container  instance  is  terminated,  the
                 instance  transitions  to  a  DEREGISTERING  status while the
                 trunk  elastic  network  interface  is   deprovisioned.   The
                 instance then transitions to an INACTIVE status.

                 The  ACTIVE  status indicates that the container instance can
                 accept tasks. The DRAINING indicates that  new  tasks  aren't
                 placed  on  the container instance and any service tasks run-
                 ning on the container instance are removed if  possible.  For
                 more information, see Container Instance Draining in the Ama-
                 zon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

              statusReason -> (string)
                 The reason that the container instance  reached  its  current
                 status.

              agentConnected -> (boolean)
                 This parameter returns true if the agent is connected to Ama-
                 zon ECS. Registered instances  with  an  agent  that  may  be
                 unhealthy  or stopped return false . Only instances connected
                 to an agent can accept placement requests.

              runningTasksCount -> (integer)
                 The number of tasks on the container instance that are in the
                 RUNNING status.

                     An  attribute is a name-value pair that's associated with
                     an Amazon ECS object. Attributes enable you to extend the
                     Amazon  ECS  data model by adding custom metadata to your
                     resources. For more information, see  Attributes  in  the
                     Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

                     name -> (string)
                        The  name  of  the  attribute.  The  name must contain
                        between 1 and 128 characters.  The  name  may  contain
                        letters  (uppercase  and  lowercase), numbers, hyphens
                        (-),  underscores  (_),  forward  slashes  (/),   back
                        slashes (), or periods (.).

                     value -> (string)
                        The  value  of  the  attribute. The value must contain
                        between 1 and 128 characters. It can  contain  letters
                        (uppercase   and  lowercase),  numbers,  hyphens  (-),
                        underscores (_), periods (.), at  signs  (@),  forward
                        slashes  (/),  back slashes (), colons (:), or spaces.
                        The value can't can't start or end with a space.

                     targetType -> (string)

                        This  parameter  is required if you use the short form
                        ID for a resource instead of the full ARN.

                     targetId -> (string)
                        The ID of the target. You can specify the  short  form
                        ID  for  a  resource  or the full Amazon Resource Name
                        (ARN).

              registeredAt -> (timestamp)
                 The Unix timestamp for the time when the  container  instance
                 was registered.

              attachments -> (list)

                     status -> (string)
                        The status of the attachment. Valid values are PRECRE-
                        ATED  ,  CREATED  , ATTACHING , ATTACHED , DETACHING ,
                        DETACHED , DELETED , and FAILED .

                     details -> (list)
                        Details of the attachment. For elastic network  inter-
                        faces, this includes the network interface ID, the MAC
                        address, the subnet ID, and the private IPv4  address.

                        (structure)
                            A key-value pair object.

                               ronment variable.

              tags -> (list)
                 The metadata that you apply to the container instance to help
                 you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a  key
                 and an optional value. You define both.

                 The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                 o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

                 o For  each  resource,  each tag key must be unique, and each
                   tag key can have only one value.

                 o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                 o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                 o If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
                   resources,  remember  that other services may have restric-
                   tions on allowed characters. Generally  allowed  characters
                   are:  letters,  numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8,
                   and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.

                 o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

                 o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combina-
                   tion of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is
                   reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You  cannot  edit  or
                   delete  tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this
                   prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.

                 (structure)
                     The metadata that you apply to a  resource  to  help  you
                     categorize  and organize them. Each tag consists of a key
                     and an optional value. You define them.

                     The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                     o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

                     o For each resource, each tag key  must  be  unique,  and
                       each tag key can have only one value.

                     o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                     o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                     o If your tagging schema is used across multiple services
                       and resources, remember that other  services  may  have
                       restrictions  on  allowed characters. Generally allowed
                       characters are: letters,  numbers,  and  spaces  repre-
                       sentable  in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - =
                       . _ : / @.

                     o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

                     o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase com-
                       bination  of such as a prefix for either keys or values
                       as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You can-
                       not edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix.
                       Tags with this prefix do not count  against  your  tags
                       per resource limit.

                     key -> (string)
                        One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key
                        is a general label that acts like a category for  more
                        specific tag values.

                     value -> (string)
                        The  optional  part of a key-value pair that make up a
                        tag. A value acts as a descriptor within a  tag  cate-
                        gory (key).

              healthStatus -> (structure)
                 An  object  representing  the  health status of the container
                 instance.

                 overallStatus -> (string)
                     The overall health status of the container instance. This
                     is  an  aggregate status of all container instance health
                     checks.

                 details -> (list)
                     An array of objects representing the details of the  con-
                     tainer instance health status.

                        An  object  representing  the  result  of  a container
                        instance health status check.

                        type -> (string)
                            The type of container instance health status  that

                        status -> (string)
                            The container instance health status.

                        lastUpdated -> (timestamp)
                            The Unix timestamp for when the container instance
                            health status was last updated.

                        lastStatusChange -> (timestamp)
                            The Unix timestamp for when the container instance
                            health status last changed.

       failures -> (list)
