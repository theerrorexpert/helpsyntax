LIST-CONTAINER-INSTANCES()                          LIST-CONTAINER-INSTANCES()



NAME
       list-container-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of container instances in a specified cluster. You can
       filter the results of a ListContainerInstances operation  with  cluster
       query  language statements inside the filter parameter. For more infor-
       mation, see Cluster Query Language in the Amazon Elastic Container Ser-
       vice Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-container-instances  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: containerInstanceArns

SYNOPSIS
            list-container-instances
          [--cluster <value>]
          [--filter <value>]
          [--status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster (string)
          The short name or full Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the  cluster
          that  hosts the container instances to list. If you do not specify a
          cluster, the default cluster is assumed.

       --filter (string)
          You can filter the results  of  a  ListContainerInstances  operation
          with  cluster  query  language statements. For more information, see
          Cluster Query Language  in  the  Amazon  Elastic  Container  Service
          Developer Guide .

       --status (string)
          Filters the container instances by status. For example, if you spec-
          ify  the  DRAINING  status,  the  results  include  only   container
          instances  that  have been set to DRAINING using  UpdateContainerIn-
          stancesState . If you don't specify this parameter, the  default  is
          to include container instances set to all states other than INACTIVE
          .

          Possible values:

          o ACTIVE

          o DRAINING

          o REGISTERING

          o DEREGISTERING

          o REGISTRATION_FAILED

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the container instances in a cluster

       The  following list-container-instances example lists all of the avail-
       able container instances in a cluster.

          aws ecs list-container-instances --cluster MyCluster

       Output:

          {
              "containerInstanceArns": [
                  "arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:123456789012:container-instance/MyCluster/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-11111EXAMPLE",
                  "arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:123456789012:container-instance/MyCluster/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-22222EXAMPLE"
              ]
          }

       For more information, see Amazon ECS Container Instances in the  Amazon
       ECS Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       containerInstanceArns -> (list)
          The  list of container instances with full ARN entries for each con-
          tainer instance associated with the specified cluster.

          (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken value to include in  a  future  ListContainerInstances
          request. When the results of a ListContainerInstances request exceed
          maxResults , this value can be used to retrieve  the  next  page  of
          results.  This  value  is  null  when  there  are no more results to
          return.
