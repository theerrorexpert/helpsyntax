UPDATE-CONTAINER-AGENT()                              UPDATE-CONTAINER-AGENT()



NAME
       update-container-agent -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the  Amazon  ECS  container  agent  on  a  specified container
       instance. Updating the Amazon ECS  container  agent  doesn't  interrupt
       running  tasks  or  services on the container instance. The process for
       updating the agent differs depending on whether your container instance
       was  launched  with  the  Amazon ECS-optimized AMI or another operating
       system.

       NOTE:
          The UpdateContainerAgent API isn't supported for container instances
          using the Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 (arm64) AMI. To update
          the container agent, you  can  update  the  ecs-init  package.  This
          updates the agent. For more information, see Updating the Amazon ECS
          container agent in the Amazon Elastic  Container  Service  Developer
          Guide .

       The  UpdateContainerAgent  API  requires an Amazon ECS-optimized AMI or
       Amazon Linux AMI with the ecs-init service installed and  running.  For
       help  updating  the  Amazon ECS container agent on other operating sys-
       tems, see Manually updating the Amazon ECS container agent in the  Ama-
       zon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-container-agent
          [--cluster <value>]
          --container-instance <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster (string)
          The  short  name  or  full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster
          that your container instance is running on. If you do not specify  a
          cluster, the default cluster is assumed.

       --container-instance (string)
          The  container  instance  ID  or  full ARN entries for the container
          instance where you would like to update  the  Amazon  ECS  container
          agent.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       The  following  update-container-agent  example  updates  the container
       agent on the specified container instance in the default cluster.

          aws ecs update-container-agent --cluster default --container-instance a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-11111EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "containerInstance": {
                  "status": "ACTIVE",
          ...
                  "agentUpdateStatus": "PENDING",

OUTPUT
       containerInstance -> (structure)
          The container instance that the container agent was updated for.

          containerInstanceArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the container instance. The
              ARN contains the arn:aws:ecs namespace, followed by  the  Region
              of the container instance, the Amazon Web Services account ID of
              the container instance owner, the container-instance  namespace,
              and    then    the   container   instance   ID.   For   example,
              arn:aws:ecs:region:aws_account_id:container-instance/con-
              tainer_instance_ID .

          ec2InstanceId -> (string)
              The ID of the container instance. For Amazon EC2 instances, this
              value is the Amazon EC2 instance  ID.  For  external  instances,
              this  value  is  the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager managed
              instance ID.

          capacityProviderName -> (string)
              The capacity  provider  that's  associated  with  the  container
              instance.

          version -> (long)
              The  version  counter  for  the container instance. Every time a
              container instance experiences a change that triggers  a  Cloud-
              Watch  event,  the  version  counter  is  incremented. If you're
              replicating your Amazon ECS container instance state with Cloud-
              Watch  Events,  you  can  compare  the  version  of  a container
              instance reported by  the  Amazon  ECS  APIs  with  the  version
              reported in CloudWatch Events for the container instance (inside
              the detail object) to verify that  the  version  in  your  event
              stream is current.

          versionInfo -> (structure)
              The  version  information for the Amazon ECS container agent and
              Docker daemon running on the container instance.

              agentVersion -> (string)
                 The version number of the Amazon ECS container agent.

              agentHash -> (string)
                 The Git commit hash for the Amazon ECS container agent  build
                 on the amazon-ecs-agent GitHub repository.

              dockerVersion -> (string)
                 The  Docker version that's running on the container instance.

          remainingResources -> (list)
              For CPU and memory resource types, this parameter describes  the
              remaining  CPU and memory that wasn't already allocated to tasks
              and is therefore available for  new  tasks.  For  port  resource
              types,  this parameter describes the ports that were reserved by
              the Amazon ECS container agent (at instance  registration  time)
              and  any task containers that have reserved port mappings on the
              host (with the host or bridge network mode). Any port that's not
              specified here is available for new tasks.

              (structure)
                 Describes the resources available for a container instance.

                 name -> (string)
                     The  name of the resource, such as CPU , MEMORY , PORTS ,

                 longValue -> (long)
                     When the longValue type is set, the value of the resource
                     must be an extended precision floating-point type.

                 integerValue -> (integer)
                     When the integerValue type  is  set,  the  value  of  the

                     (string)

          registeredResources -> (list)
              For CPU and memory resource types, this parameter describes  the
              amount  of  each  resource  that  was available on the container
              instance when the container agent registered it with Amazon ECS.
              This  value  represents  the total amount of CPU and memory that
              can be allocated on this container instance to tasks.  For  port
              resource  types,  this  parameter  describes the ports that were
              reserved by the Amazon ECS container agent  when  it  registered
              the container instance with Amazon ECS.

              (structure)
                 Describes the resources available for a container instance.

                 name -> (string)
                     The  name of the resource, such as CPU , MEMORY , PORTS ,
                     PORTS_UDP , or a user-defined resource.

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of the resource. Valid values: INTEGER ,  DOUBLE
                     , LONG , or STRINGSET .

                 doubleValue -> (double)
                     When  the  doubleValue  type  is  set,  the  value of the
                     resource must be a double precision floating-point  type.

                 longValue -> (long)
                     When the longValue type is set, the value of the resource
                     must be an extended precision floating-point type.

                 integerValue -> (integer)
                     When the integerValue type  is  set,  the  value  of  the
                     resource must be an integer.

                 stringSetValue -> (list)
                     When  the  stringSetValue  type  is set, the value of the
                     resource must be a string type.

                     (string)

          status -> (string)
              The status of the container instance. The valid values are  REG-
              ISTERING , REGISTRATION_FAILED , ACTIVE , INACTIVE , DEREGISTER-
              ING , or DRAINING .

              If your account has opted in to the awsvpcTrunking account  set-
              ting,  then any newly registered container instance will transi-
              tion to a REGISTERING status while  the  trunk  elastic  network
              interface  is  provisioned for the instance. If the registration
              fails, the instance will  transition  to  a  REGISTRATION_FAILED
              status. You can describe the container instance and see the rea-
              son for failure in the statusReason  parameter.  Once  the  con-
              tainer  instance  is  terminated,  the instance transitions to a
              DEREGISTERING status while the trunk elastic  network  interface
              is  deprovisioned.  The instance then transitions to an INACTIVE
              status.

              The ACTIVE status indicates  that  the  container  instance  can
              accept  tasks.  The  DRAINING  indicates  that  new tasks aren't
              placed on the container instance and any service  tasks  running
              on  the  container  instance  are  removed if possible. For more
              information, see Container Instance Draining in the Amazon Elas-
              tic Container Service Developer Guide .

          statusReason -> (string)
              The  reason that the container instance reached its current sta-
              tus.

          agentConnected -> (boolean)
              This parameter returns true if the agent is connected to  Amazon
              ECS. Registered instances with an agent that may be unhealthy or
              stopped return false . Only instances connected to an agent  can
              accept placement requests.

          runningTasksCount -> (integer)
              The  number  of  tasks on the container instance that are in the
              RUNNING status.

          pendingTasksCount -> (integer)
              The number of tasks on the container instance that  are  in  the
              PENDING status.

          agentUpdateStatus -> (string)
              The  status of the most recent agent update. If an update wasn't
              ever requested, this value is NULL .

          attributes -> (list)
              The attributes set for the container  instance,  either  by  the
              Amazon  ECS container agent at instance registration or manually
              with the  PutAttributes operation.

              (structure)
                 An attribute is a name-value pair that's associated  with  an
                 Amazon ECS object. Attributes enable you to extend the Amazon
                 ECS data model by adding custom metadata to  your  resources.
                 For  more  information,  see Attributes in the Amazon Elastic
                 Container Service Developer Guide .

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of the attribute. The name must contain  between
                     1  and  128  characters.  The  name  may  contain letters
                     (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens  (-),  under-
                     scores  (_),  forward  slashes  (/),  back slashes (), or

                 value -> (string)
                     The value  of  the  attribute.  The  value  must  contain
                     between  1  and  128  characters.  It can contain letters
                     (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens  (-),  under-
                     scores  (_),  periods  (.), at signs (@), forward slashes
                     (/), back slashes (), colons (:), or  spaces.  The  value
                     can't can't start or end with a space.

                 targetType -> (string)
                     The type of the target to attach the attribute with. This
                     parameter is required if you use the short form ID for  a
                     resource instead of the full ARN.

                 targetId -> (string)
                     The  ID  of the target. You can specify the short form ID
                     for a resource or the full Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

          registeredAt -> (timestamp)
              The Unix timestamp for the time when the container instance  was
              registered.

          attachments -> (list)
              The  resources attached to a container instance, such as elastic
              network interfaces.

              (structure)
                 An object representing a container instance or  task  attach-
                 ment.

                 id -> (string)

                 details -> (list)
                     Details of the attachment.  For  elastic  network  inter-
                     faces,  this  includes  the network interface ID, the MAC
                     address, the subnet ID, and the private IPv4 address.

                     (structure)
                        A key-value pair object.

                        name -> (string)
                            The name of the key-value  pair.  For  environment
                            variables,  this  is  the  name of the environment
                            variable.

                        value -> (string)
                            The value of the key-value pair.  For  environment
                            variables,  this  is  the value of the environment
                            variable.

          tags -> (list)
              The metadata that you apply to the container  instance  to  help
              you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and
              an optional value. You define both.

              The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

              o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

              o For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and  each  tag
                key can have only one value.

              o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

              o If  your  tagging  schema is used across multiple services and
                resources, remember that other services may have  restrictions
                on  allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: let-
                ters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the fol-
                lowing characters: + - = . _ : / @.

              o Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

              o Do not use aws: , AWS: , or any upper or lowercase combination
                of such as a prefix  for  either  keys  or  values  as  it  is
                reserved  for  Amazon  Web  Services  use.  You cannot edit or
                delete tag keys or values with this  prefix.  Tags  with  this
                prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.

              (structure)
                 The metadata that you apply to a resource to help you catego-
                 rize and organize them. Each tag consists of  a  key  and  an
                 optional value. You define them.

                 The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

                 o Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

                 o For  each  resource,  each tag key must be unique, and each
                   tag key can have only one value.

                 o Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                 o Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

                 o If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
                   resources,  remember  that other services may have restric-
                   tions on allowed characters. Generally  allowed  characters
                   are:  letters,  numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8,
