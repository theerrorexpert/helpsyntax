LIST-TASK-DEFINITION-FAMILIES()                LIST-TASK-DEFINITION-FAMILIES()



NAME
       list-task-definition-families -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list of task definition families that are registered to your
       account. This list includes task definition  families  that  no  longer
       have any ACTIVE task definition revisions.

       You  can  filter  out  task  definition families that don't contain any
       ACTIVE task definition revisions by setting  the  status  parameter  to
       ACTIVE  . You can also filter the results with the familyPrefix parame-
       ter.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-task-definition-families is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: families

SYNOPSIS
            list-task-definition-families
          [--family-prefix <value>]
          [--status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --family-prefix (string)
          The  familyPrefix  is  a string that's used to filter the results of
          ListTaskDefinitionFamilies . If you specify a  familyPrefix  ,  only
          task definition family names that begin with the familyPrefix string
          are returned.

       --status (string)
          The task definition family status to filter the  ListTaskDefinition-
          Families  results  with.  By  default, both ACTIVE and INACTIVE task
          definition families are listed. If this parameter is set to ACTIVE ,
          only  task  definition  families that have an ACTIVE task definition
          revision are returned. If this parameter is set to INACTIVE  ,  only
          task definition families that do not have any ACTIVE task definition
          revisions are returned. If you paginate  the  resulting  output,  be
          sure to keep the status value constant in each subsequent request.

          Possible values:

          o ACTIVE

          o INACTIVE

          o ALL

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To list the registered task definition families

       The following list-task-definition-families example lists  all  of  the
       registered task definition families.

          aws ecs list-task-definition-families

       Output:

          {
              "families": [
                  "node-js-app",
                  "web-timer",
                  "hpcc",
                  "hpcc-c4-8xlarge"
              ]
          }

       Example 2: To filter the registered task definition families

       The following list-task-definition-families example lists the task def-
       inition revisions that start with "hpcc".

          aws ecs list-task-definition-families --family-prefix hpcc

       Output:

          {
              "families": [
                  "hpcc",
                  "hpcc-c4-8xlarge"
              ]
          }

       Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       families -> (list)
          The list of task definition family names that match the ListTaskDef-
          initionFamilies request.

          (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken value to include in a  future  ListTaskDefinitionFami-
          lies  request.  When  the  results  of  a ListTaskDefinitionFamilies
          request exceed maxResults , this value can be used to  retrieve  the
          next  page  of  results.  This  value is null when there are no more
          results to return.
