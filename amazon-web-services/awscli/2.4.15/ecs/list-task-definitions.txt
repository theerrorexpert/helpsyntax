LIST-TASK-DEFINITIONS()                                LIST-TASK-DEFINITIONS()



NAME
       list-task-definitions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of task definitions that are registered to your account.
       You can filter the results by family name with the familyPrefix parame-
       ter or by status with the status parameter.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-task-definitions  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: taskDefinitionArns

SYNOPSIS
            list-task-definitions
          [--family-prefix <value>]
          [--status <value>]
          [--sort <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --family-prefix (string)
          The full family name to filter the ListTaskDefinitions results with.
          Specifying a familyPrefix limits the listed task definitions to task
          definition revisions that belong to that family.

       --status (string)
          The task definition status to filter the ListTaskDefinitions results
          with.  By  default, only ACTIVE task definitions are listed. By set-
          ting this parameter to INACTIVE , you can view task definitions that
          are  INACTIVE  as long as an active task or service still references
          them. If you paginate the resulting output, be sure to keep the sta-
          tus value constant in each subsequent request.

          Possible values:

          o ACTIVE

          o INACTIVE

       --sort (string)
          The order to sort the results in. Valid values are ASC and DESC . By
          default, (ASC ) task definitions  are  listed  lexicographically  by
          family name and in ascending numerical order by revision so that the
          newest task definitions in a family are listed  last.  Setting  this
          parameter  to  DESC reverses the sort order on family name and revi-
          sion. This is so that the newest task definitions in  a  family  are
          listed first.

          Possible values:

          o ASC

          o DESC

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

              "taskDefinitionArns": [
                  "arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:123456789012:task-definition/wordpress:3",
                  "arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:123456789012:task-definition/wordpress:4",
                  "arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:123456789012:task-definition/wordpress:5",
                  "arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:123456789012:task-definition/wordpress:6"
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       taskDefinitionArns -> (list)
          The  list  of task definition Amazon Resource Name (ARN) entries for
          the ListTaskDefinitions request.

          (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken value  to  include  in  a  future  ListTaskDefinitions
          request.  When  the  results of a ListTaskDefinitions request exceed
          maxResults , this value can be used to retrieve  the  next  page  of
          results.  This  value  is  null  when  there  are no more results to
          return.
