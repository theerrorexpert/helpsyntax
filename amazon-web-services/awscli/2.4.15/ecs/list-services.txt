LIST-SERVICES()                                                LIST-SERVICES()



NAME
       list-services -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of  services.  You can filter the results by cluster,
       launch type, and scheduling strategy.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-services is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: serviceArns

SYNOPSIS
            list-services
          [--cluster <value>]
          [--launch-type <value>]
          [--scheduling-strategy <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster (string)
          The  short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster to
          use when filtering the ListServices results. If you do not specify a
          cluster, the default cluster is assumed.

       --launch-type (string)
          The launch type to use when filtering the ListServices results.

          Possible values:

          o EC2

          o FARGATE

          o EXTERNAL

       --scheduling-strategy (string)
          The  scheduling  strategy  to  use  when  filtering the ListServices
          results.

          Possible values:

          o REPLICA

          o DAEMON

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the services in a cluster

       The following list-services example shows how to list the services run-
       ning in a cluster.

          aws ecs list-services --cluster MyCluster

       Output:

           {
               "serviceArns": [
                   "arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:123456789012:service/MyCluster/MyService"
               ]
          }

       For more information, see Services in the Amazon ECS Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       serviceArns -> (list)
          The list of full ARN entries for each service that's associated with
          the specified cluster.

          (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  nextToken  value  to  include in a future ListServices request.
          When the results of a ListServices request exceed maxResults ,  this
          value  can  be used to retrieve the next page of results. This value
          is null when there are no more results to return.
