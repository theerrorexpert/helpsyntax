LIST-TASKS()                                                      LIST-TASKS()



NAME
       list-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of tasks. You can filter the results by cluster, task
       definition family, container instance, launch type, what IAM  principal
       started the task, or by the desired status of the task.

       Recently stopped tasks might appear in the returned results. Currently,
       stopped tasks appear in the returned results for at least one hour.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-tasks is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the  results  of  the  following  query
       expressions: taskArns

SYNOPSIS
            list-tasks
          [--cluster <value>]
          [--container-instance <value>]
          [--family <value>]
          [--started-by <value>]
          [--service-name <value>]
          [--desired-status <value>]
          [--launch-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster (string)
          The  short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster to
          use when filtering the ListTasks results. If you do  not  specify  a
          cluster, the default cluster is assumed.

       --container-instance (string)
          The  container  instance ID or full ARN of the container instance to
          use when filtering the ListTasks results. Specifying a  containerIn-
          stance  limits  the  results  to tasks that belong to that container
          instance.

       --family (string)
          The name of the task definition family to  use  when  filtering  the
          ListTasks  results.  Specifying a family limits the results to tasks
          that belong to that family.

       --started-by (string)
          The startedBy value to filter the task results  with.  Specifying  a
          startedBy  value  limits the results to tasks that were started with
          that value.

       --service-name (string)
          The name of the service to use when filtering the ListTasks results.
          Specifying  a serviceName limits the results to tasks that belong to
          that service.

       --desired-status (string)
          The task desired status to use when filtering the ListTasks results.
          Specifying  a  desiredStatus  of STOPPED limits the results to tasks
          that Amazon ECS has set the desired status to STOPPED . This can  be
          useful  for  debugging  tasks  that aren't starting properly or have
          died or finished. The default status filter is RUNNING , which shows
          tasks that Amazon ECS has set the desired status to RUNNING .

          NOTE:
              Although  you  can  filter  results based on a desired status of
              PENDING , this doesn't return any results. Amazon ECS never sets
              the  desired status of a task to that value (only a task's last-
              Status may have a value of PENDING ).

          Possible values:

          o RUNNING

          o PENDING

          o STOPPED

       --launch-type (string)
          The launch type to use when filtering the ListTasks results.

          Possible values:

          o EC2

          o FARGATE

          o EXTERNAL

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To list the tasks in a cluster

       The following list-tasks example lists all of the tasks in a cluster.

          aws ecs list-tasks --cluster default

       Output:

          {
              "taskArns": [
                  "arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:123456789012:task/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-11111EXAMPLE",
                  "arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:123456789012:task/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-22222EXAMPLE"
              ]
          }

       Example 2: To list the tasks on a particular container instance

       The  following  list-tasks  example  lists  the  tasks  on  a container
       instance, using the container instance UUID as a filter.

          aws ecs list-tasks --cluster default --container-instance a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-33333EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "taskArns": [
                  "arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:123456789012:task/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-44444EXAMPLE"
              ]
          }

       For more information, see Amazon ECS Task Definitions in the Amazon ECS
       Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       taskArns -> (list)
          The list of task ARN entries for the ListTasks request.

          (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  nextToken  value to include in a future ListTasks request. When
          the results of a ListTasks request exceed maxResults  ,  this  value
          can be used to retrieve the next page of results. This value is null
          when there are no more results to return.
