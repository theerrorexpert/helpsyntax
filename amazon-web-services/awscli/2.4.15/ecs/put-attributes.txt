NAME
       put-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Create  or  update  an  attribute  on  an  Amazon  ECS resource. If the
       attribute doesn't exist, it's created. If  the  attribute  exists,  its
       value is replaced with the specified value. To delete an attribute, use
       DeleteAttributes . For more information, see Attributes in  the  Amazon
       Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-attributes
          [--cluster <value>]
          --attributes <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster (string)
          The  short  name  or  full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster
          that contains the resource to apply attributes. If you do not  spec-
          ify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.

       --attributes (list)
          The  attributes  to apply to your resource. You can specify up to 10
          custom attributes for each  resource.  You  can  specify  up  to  10
          attributes in a single call.

          (structure)
              An attribute is a name-value pair that's associated with an Ama-
              zon ECS object. Attributes enable you to extend the  Amazon  ECS
              data model by adding custom metadata to your resources. For more
              information, see Attributes in the Amazon Elastic Container Ser-
              vice Developer Guide .

              name -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the attribute. The name must contain between 1
                 and 128 characters. The name may contain  letters  (uppercase
                 and  lowercase),  numbers, hyphens (-), underscores (_), for-
                 ward slashes (/), back slashes (), or periods (.).

              value -> (string)
                 The value of the attribute. The value must contain between  1
                 and  128  characters.  It  can contain letters (uppercase and
                 lowercase), numbers, hyphens (-),  underscores  (_),  periods
                 (.),  at  signs  (@),  forward  slashes (/), back slashes (),
                 colons (:), or spaces. The value can't  can't  start  or  end
                 with a space.

              targetType -> (string)
                 The  type  of  the  target to attach the attribute with. This
                 parameter is required if you use the  short  form  ID  for  a
                 resource instead of the full ARN.

              targetId -> (string)
                 The ID of the target. You can specify the short form ID for a
                 resource or the full Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,value=string,targetType=string,targetId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "value": "string",
              "targetType": "container-instance",
              "targetId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create an attribute and associate it with an Amazon ECS resource

       The following put-attributes applies an attribute with the  name  stack
       and the value production to a container instance.

          aws ecs put-attributes \
              --attributes name=stack,value=production,targetId=arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:130757420319:container-instance/1c3be8ed-df30-47b4-8f1e-6e68ebd01f34

       Output:

          {
              "attributes": [
                  {
                      "name": "stack",
                      "targetId": "arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:130757420319:container-instance/1c3be8ed-df30-47b4-8f1e-6e68ebd01f34",
                      "value": "production"
                  }
              ]
          }
