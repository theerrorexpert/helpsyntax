SYNOPSIS
            batch-create-channel-membership
          --channel-arn <value>
          [--type <value>]
          --member-arns <value>
          --chime-bearer <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel-arn (string)
          The ARN of the channel to which you're adding users.

       --type (string)
          The  membership  type of a user, DEFAULT or HIDDEN . Default members
          are always returned as part of ListChannelMemberships . Hidden  mem-
          bers  are only returned if the type filter in ListChannelMemberships
          equals HIDDEN . Otherwise hidden members are not returned.  This  is
          only supported by moderators.

          Possible values:

          o DEFAULT

          o HIDDEN

       --member-arns (list)
          The AppInstanceUserArn s of the members you want to add to the chan-
          nel.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --chime-bearer (string)
          The AppInstanceUserArn of the user that makes the API call.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
