NAME
       put-channel-membership-preferences -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets the membership preferences of an AppInstanceUser for the specified
       channel. The AppInstanceUser must be a member of the channel. Only  the
       AppInstanceUser  who  owns the membership can set preferences. Users in
       the AppInstanceAdmin and channel moderator roles can't set  preferences
       for  other users. Banned users can't set membership preferences for the
       channel from which they are banned.

SYNOPSIS
            put-channel-membership-preferences
          --channel-arn <value>
          --member-arn <value>
          --chime-bearer <value>
          --preferences <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel-arn (string)
          The ARN of the channel.

       --member-arn (string)
          The AppInstanceUserArn of the member setting the preferences.

       --chime-bearer (string)
          The AppInstanceUserARN of the user making the API call.

       --preferences (structure)
          The channel membership preferences of an AppInstanceUser .

          PushNotifications -> (structure)
              The push notification configuration of a message.

              AllowNotifications -> (string)
                 Enum value that indicates which push notifications to send to
                 the requested member of a channel. ALL sends all push notifi-
                 cations, NONE sends no  push  notifications,  FILTERED  sends
                 only filtered push notifications.

              FilterRule -> (string)
                 The  simple JSON object used to send a subset of a push noti-
                 fication to the requsted member.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          PushNotifications={AllowNotifications=string,FilterRule=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "PushNotifications": {
              "AllowNotifications": "ALL"|"NONE"|"FILTERED",
              "FilterRule": "string"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
