NAME
       get-channel-membership-preferences -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the membership preferences of an AppInstanceUser for the specified
       channel. The AppInstanceUser must be a member of the channel. Only  the
       AppInstanceUser who owns the membership can retrieve preferences. Users
       in the AppInstanceAdmin and  channel  moderator  roles  can't  retrieve
       preferences  for  other  users.  Banned users can't retrieve membership
       preferences for the channel from which they are banned.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-channel-membership-preferences
          --channel-arn <value>
          --member-arn <value>
          --chime-bearer <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel-arn (string)
          The ARN of the channel.

       --member-arn (string)
          The AppInstanceUserArn of the member retrieving the preferences.

       --chime-bearer (string)
          The AppInstanceUserARN of the user making the API call.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
