NAME
       list-channels -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  Channels  created  under  a single Chime App as a paginated
       list. You can specify filters to narrow results.
          Functionality & restrictions

       o Use privacy = PUBLIC to retrieve all public channels in the  account.

       o Only  an  AppInstanceAdmin can set privacy = PRIVATE to list the pri-
         vate channels in an account.

       NOTE:
          The x-amz-chime-bearer request header is mandatory. Use  the  AppIn-
          stanceUserArn  of  the  user that makes the API call as the value in
          the header.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-channels
          --app-instance-arn <value>
          [--privacy <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          --chime-bearer <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --app-instance-arn (string)
          The ARN of the AppInstance .

       --privacy (string)
          The privacy setting. PUBLIC retrieves all the public channels.  PRI-
          VATE  retrieves  private  channels.  Only  an  AppInstanceAdmin  can
          retrieve private channels.

          Possible values:

          o PUBLIC

          o PRIVATE

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of channels that you want to return.

       --next-token (string)
          The token passed by previous API calls until all requested  channels
          are returned.

       --chime-bearer (string)
          The AppInstanceUserArn of the user that makes the API call.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
