LIST-CHANNELS-ASSOCIATED-WITH-CHANLIST-CHANNELS-ASSOCIATED-WITH-CHANNEL-FLOW()



NAME
       list-channels-associated-with-channel-flow -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  channels  associated with a specified channel flow. You can
       associate a channel flow with multiple channels, but you can only asso-
       ciate a channel with one channel flow. This is a developer API.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-channels-associated-with-channel-flow
          --channel-flow-arn <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel-flow-arn (string)
          The ARN of the channel flow.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of channels that you want to return.

       --next-token (string)
          The  token passed by previous API calls until all requested channels
          are returned.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              Name -> (string)

              ChannelArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the channel.

              Mode -> (string)
                 The mode of the channel.

              Privacy -> (string)
