LIST-ITEMS()                                                      LIST-ITEMS()



NAME
       list-items -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  a  list  of metadata entries about folders and objects in the
       specified folder.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-items is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the  results  of  the  following  query
       expressions: Items

SYNOPSIS
            list-items
          [--path <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --path (string)
          The  path  in  the  container  from which to retrieve items. Format:
          <folder name>/<folder name>/<file name>

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Items -> (list)
          The metadata entries for the folders and objects  at  the  requested
          path.

          (structure)
              A metadata entry for a folder or object.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the item.

              Type -> (string)
                 The item type (folder or object).

              ETag -> (string)
                 The ETag that represents a unique instance of the item.

              LastModified -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the item was last modified.

              ContentType -> (string)
                 The content type of the item.

              ContentLength -> (long)
                 The length of the item in bytes.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token  that  can  be  used in a request to view the next set of
          results. For example, you submit a ListItems  request  that  matches
          2,000  items  with  MaxResults  set  at 500. The service returns the
          first batch of results (up to 500) and a NextToken value that can be
          used to fetch the next batch of results.
