GET-OBJECT()                                                      GET-OBJECT()



NAME
       get-object -

DESCRIPTION
       Downloads  the  object  at  the  specified  path. If the objects upload
       availability is set to streaming , AWS Elemental  MediaStore  downloads
       the object even if its still uploading the object.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-object
          --path <value>
          [--range <value>]
          <outfile>

OPTIONS
       --path (string)
          The path (including the file name) where the object is stored in the
          container. Format: <folder name>/<folder name>/<file name>

          For example, to upload the file mlaw.avi to  the  folder  path  pre-
          mium\canada   in   the  container  movies  ,  enter  the  path  pre-
          mium/canada/mlaw.avi .

          Do not include the container name in this path.

          If the path includes any folders that don't exist yet,  the  service
          creates  them. For example, suppose you have an existing premium/usa
          subfolder. If you specify premium/canada ,  the  service  creates  a
          canada  subfolder  in the premium folder. You then have two subfold-
          ers, usa and canada , in the premium folder.

          There is no correlation between the path to the source and the  path
          (folders) in the container in AWS Elemental MediaStore.

          For  more  information  about  folders  and how they exist in a con-
          tainer, see the AWS Elemental MediaStore User Guide .

          The file name is the name that is assigned  to  the  file  that  you
          upload.  The  file  can have the same name inside and outside of AWS
          Elemental MediaStore, or it can have the same name.  The  file  name
          can include or omit an extension.

       --range (string)
          The range bytes of an object to retrieve. For more information about
          the                Range                 header,                 see
          http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.35    .
          AWS Elemental MediaStore ignores this header for partially  uploaded
          objects that have streaming upload availability.

       outfile (string) Filename where the content will be saved

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To download an entire object

       The following get-object example downloads the specified object.

          aws mediastore-data get-object \
              --endpoint https://aaabbbcccdddee.data.mediastore.us-west-2.amazonaws.com \
              --path events/baseball/setup.jpg setup.jpg

       Output:

          {
              "ContentType": "image/jpeg",
              "StatusCode": 200,
              "ETag": "2aa333bbcc8d8d22d777e999c88d4aa9eeeeee4dd89ff7f555555555555da6d3",
              "ContentLength": "3860266",
              "LastModified": "Fri, 19 Jul 2019 21:50:31 GMT"
          }

       Example 2: To download part of an object

       The  following  get-object  example  downloads the specified part of an
       object.

          aws mediastore-data get-object \
              --endpoint https://aaabbbcccdddee.data.mediastore.us-west-2.amazonaws.com \
              --path events/baseball/setup.jpg setup.jpg \
              --range "bytes=0-100"

       Output:

          {
              "StatusCode": 206,
              "LastModified": "Fri, 19 Jul 2019 21:50:31 GMT",
              "ContentType": "image/jpeg",
              "ContentRange": "bytes 0-100/3860266",
              "ETag": "2aa333bbcc8d8d22d777e999c88d4aa9eeeeee4dd89ff7f555555555555da6d3",
