NAME
       describe-index-fields -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  information  about  the  index  fields  configured for the search
       domain. Can be limited to specific fields by name.  By  default,  shows
       all  fields  and includes any pending changes to the configuration. Set
       the Deployed option to  true  to  show  the  active  configuration  and
       exclude  pending  changes.  For  more  information,  see Getting Domain
       Information in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-index-fields
          --domain-name <value>
          [--field-names <value>]
          [--deployed | --no-deployed]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The name of the domain you want to describe.

       --field-names (list)
          A list of the index fields you want to describe. If  not  specified,
          information is returned for all configured index fields.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --deployed | --no-deployed (boolean)
          Whether to display the deployed configuration (true ) or include any
          pending changes (false ). Defaults to false .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       IndexFields -> (list)
          The index fields configured for the domain.

          (structure)
              The value of an IndexField and its current status.

              Options -> (structure)
                 Configuration information for a field in the index, including
                 its  name, type, and options. The supported options depend on
                 the `` IndexFieldType`` .

                 IndexFieldName -> (string)
                     A string that represents the  name  of  an  index  field.
                     CloudSearch  supports  regular  index  fields  as well as
                     dynamic fields. A dynamic field's name defines a  pattern
                     that  begins or ends with a wildcard. Any document fields
                     that don't map to a regular index field but  do  match  a
                     dynamic  field's  pattern are configured with the dynamic
                     field's indexing options.

                     Regular field names begin with a letter and  can  contain
                     the  following  characters:  a-z  (lowercase), 0-9, and _
                     (underscore). Dynamic field names must begin or end  with
                     a wildcard (*). The wildcard can also be the only charac-
                     ter in a dynamic  field  name.  Multiple  wildcards,  and
                     wildcards embedded within a string are not supported.

                     The  name score is reserved and cannot be used as a field
                     name. To reference a document's ID, you can use the  name
                     _id .

                 IndexFieldType -> (string)
                     The  type  of field. The valid options for a field depend
                     on the field type. For more information  about  the  sup-
                     ported  field  types, see Configuring Index Fields in the
                     Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide .

                 IntOptions -> (structure)
                     Options for a 64-bit signed  integer  field.  Present  if
                     IndexFieldType  specifies  the field is of type int . All
                     options are enabled by default.

                     DefaultValue -> (long)
                        A value to use for the field if the field isn't speci-
                        fied  for a document. This can be important if you are
                        using the field in an expression and that field is not
                        present in every document.

                     SourceField -> (string)
                        The name of the source field to map to the field.

                     FacetEnabled -> (boolean)
                        Whether  facet  information  can  be  returned for the
                        field.

                     SearchEnabled -> (boolean)
                        Whether the contents of the field are searchable.

                     ReturnEnabled -> (boolean)
                        Whether the contents of the field can be  returned  in
                        the search results.

                     SortEnabled -> (boolean)
                        Whether  the  field  can  be  used  to sort the search
                        results.

                 DoubleOptions -> (structure)
                     Options for  a  double-precision  64-bit  floating  point
                     field.  Present  if IndexFieldType specifies the field is
                     of type double . All options are enabled by default.

                     DefaultValue -> (double)
                        A value to use for the field if the field isn't speci-

                        using the field in an expression and that field is not
                        present in every document.

                     SourceField -> (string)

                     FacetEnabled -> (boolean)
                        Whether  facet  information  can  be  returned for the

                        the search results.

                     SortEnabled -> (boolean)
                        Whether  the  field  can  be  used  to sort the search
                        results.

                 LiteralOptions -> (structure)
                     Options for  literal  field.  Present  if  IndexFieldType
                     specifies  the field is of type literal . All options are
                     enabled by default.

                     DefaultValue -> (string)
                        A value to use for the field if the field isn't speci-

                     SourceField -> (string)
                        A  string  that represents the name of an index field.
                        CloudSearch supports regular index fields as  well  as
                        dynamic  fields. A dynamic field's name defines a pat-
                        tern that begins or ends with a wildcard. Any document
                        fields  that don't map to a regular index field but do
                        match a dynamic field's pattern  are  configured  with
                        the dynamic field's indexing options.

                        end with a wildcard (*). The wildcard can also be  the
                        only character in a dynamic field name. Multiple wild-
                        cards, and wildcards embedded within a string are  not
                        supported.

                        The  name  score  is  reserved and cannot be used as a
                        field name. To reference a document's ID, you can  use
                        the name _id .

                     FacetEnabled -> (boolean)
                        Whether  facet  information  can  be  returned for the
