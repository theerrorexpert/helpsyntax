DESCRIBE-SUGGESTERS()                                    DESCRIBE-SUGGESTERS()



NAME
       describe-suggesters -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the suggesters configured for a domain. A suggester enables you to
       display possible matches before users finish typing their queries.  Can
       be  limited  to specific suggesters by name. By default, shows all sug-
       gesters and includes any pending changes to the configuration. Set  the
       Deployed  option  to  true to show the active configuration and exclude
       pending changes. For more information, see Getting  Search  Suggestions
       in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-suggesters
          --domain-name <value>
          [--suggester-names <value>]
          [--deployed | --no-deployed]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The name of the domain you want to describe.

       --suggester-names (list)
          The suggesters you want to describe.

          (string)
              Names  must  begin  with  a letter and can contain the following
              characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and _ (underscore).

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --deployed | --no-deployed (boolean)
          Whether to display the deployed configuration (true ) or include any
          pending changes (false ). Defaults to false .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Suggesters -> (list)
          The suggesters configured for the domain specified in the request.

          (structure)
              The value of a Suggester and its current status.

              Options -> (structure)
                 Configuration  information  for a search suggester. Each sug-
                 gester has a unique name and specifies  the  text  field  you
                 want  to  use  for  suggestions. The following options can be
                 configured for a suggester: FuzzyMatching , SortExpression  .

                 SuggesterName -> (string)
                     Names  must  begin with a letter and can contain the fol-
                     lowing characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9,  and  _  (under-
                     score).

                 DocumentSuggesterOptions -> (structure)
                     Options for a search suggester.

                     SourceField -> (string)
                        The  name  of the index field you want to use for sug-
                        gestions.

                     FuzzyMatching -> (string)
                        The level of fuzziness allowed when suggesting matches
                        for  a  string:  none , low , or high . With none, the
                        specified string is treated as an exact  prefix.  With
                        low, suggestions must differ from the specified string
                        by no more than one character. With high,  suggestions
                        can  differ  by  up  to two characters. The default is
                        none.

                     SortExpression -> (string)
                        An expression that computes a score for  each  sugges-
                        tion  to  control  how they are sorted. The scores are
                        rounded to the nearest integer, with a floor of 0  and
                        a  ceiling  of 2^31-1. A document's relevance score is
                        not computed for suggestions, so sort expressions can-
                        not  reference  the  _score value. To sort suggestions
                        using a numeric field or existing  expression,  simply
                        specify  the  name  of  the field or expression. If no
                        expression is configured for the suggester,  the  sug-
                        gestions  are  sorted  with the closest matches listed
                        first.

              Status -> (structure)
                 The status of domain configuration option.

                 CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                     A timestamp for when this option was created.

                 UpdateDate -> (timestamp)
                     A timestamp for when this option was last updated.

                 UpdateVersion -> (integer)
                     A unique integer that indicates when this option was last
                     updated.

                 State -> (string)
                     The  state  of processing a change to an option. Possible
                     values:

                     o RequiresIndexDocuments : the option's latest value will
                       not  be  deployed until  IndexDocuments has been called
                       and indexing is complete.

                     o Processing :  the  option's  latest  value  is  in  the
                       process of being activated.

                     o Active  :  the  option's  latest  value  is  completely
                       deployed.

                     o FailedToValidate : the option value is  not  compatible
                       with  the domain's data and cannot be used to index the
                       data. You must either modify the option value or update
                       or remove the incompatible documents.

                 PendingDeletion -> (boolean)
                     Indicates that the option will be deleted once processing
                     is complete.
