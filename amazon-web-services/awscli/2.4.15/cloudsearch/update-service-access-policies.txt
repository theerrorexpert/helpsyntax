NAME
       update-service-access-policies -

DESCRIPTION
       Configures  the  access rules that control access to the domain's docu-
       ment and search endpoints. For more information, see Configuring Access
       for an Amazon CloudSearch Domain .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-service-access-policies
          --domain-name <value>
          --access-policies <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          A  string  that  represents  the  name of a domain. Domain names are
          unique across the domains owned by an account within an AWS  region.
          Domain  names start with a letter or number and can contain the fol-
          lowing characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and - (hyphen).

       --access-policies (string)
          The access rules you want to  configure.  These  rules  replace  any
          existing rules.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AccessPolicies -> (structure)
          The access rules configured for the domain.

          Options -> (string)
              Access  rules  for  a  domain's  document or search service end-
              points. For more  information,  see  Configuring  Access  for  a
              Search  Domain  in  the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide . The
              maximum size of a policy document is 100 KB.

          Status -> (structure)
              The status of domain configuration option.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp for when this option was created.

              UpdateDate -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp for when this option was last updated.

              UpdateVersion -> (integer)
                 A unique integer that indicates when  this  option  was  last
                 updated.

              State -> (string)
                 The  state of processing a change to an option. Possible val-
                 ues:

                 o RequiresIndexDocuments : the option's latest value will not
                   be  deployed  until   IndexDocuments  has  been  called and
                   indexing is complete.

                 o Processing : the option's latest value is in the process of
                   being activated.

                 o Active  : the option's latest value is completely deployed.

                 o FailedToValidate : the option value is not compatible  with
                   the domain's data and cannot be used to index the data. You
                   must either modify the option value or update or remove the
                   incompatible documents.

              PendingDeletion -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  that the option will be deleted once processing is
                 complete.
