DEFINE-EXPRESSION()                                        DEFINE-EXPRESSION()



NAME
       define-expression -

DESCRIPTION
       Configures an `` Expression`` for the search domain. Used to create new
       expressions and modify existing ones. If the expression exists, the new
       configuration   replaces   the  old  one.  For  more  information,  see
       Configuring Expressions in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            define-expression
          --domain-name <value>
          --expression <value>
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          A string that represents the name of  a  domain.  Domain  names  are
          unique  across the domains owned by an account within an AWS region.
          Domain names start with a letter or number and can contain the  fol-
          lowing characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and - (hyphen).

       --expression (string)
          The  expression  to  evaluate  for sorting while processing a search
          request. The Expression syntax is based on  JavaScript  expressions.
          For  more  information,  see  Configuring  Expressions in the Amazon
          CloudSearch Developer Guide .

       --name (string)
          Names must begin with a letter and can contain the following charac-
          ters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and _ (underscore).

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Expression -> (structure)
          The value of an Expression and its current status.

          Options -> (structure)
              The  expression that is evaluated for sorting while processing a
              search request.

              ExpressionName -> (string)
                 Names must begin with a letter and can contain the  following
                 characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and _ (underscore).

              ExpressionValue -> (string)
                 The  expression  to  evaluate  for sorting while processing a
                 search request. The Expression syntax is based on  JavaScript
                 expressions.  For  more  information, see Configuring Expres-
                 sions in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide .

          Status -> (structure)
              The status of domain configuration option.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp for when this option was created.

              UpdateDate -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp for when this option was last updated.

              UpdateVersion -> (integer)
                 A unique integer that indicates when  this  option  was  last
                 updated.

              State -> (string)
                 The  state of processing a change to an option. Possible val-
                 ues:

                 o RequiresIndexDocuments : the option's latest value will not
                   be  deployed  until   IndexDocuments  has  been  called and
                   indexing is complete.

                 o Processing : the option's latest value is in the process of
                   being activated.

                 o Active  : the option's latest value is completely deployed.

                 o FailedToValidate : the option value is not compatible  with
                   the domain's data and cannot be used to index the data. You
                   must either modify the option value or update or remove the
                   incompatible documents.

              PendingDeletion -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  that the option will be deleted once processing is
                 complete.
