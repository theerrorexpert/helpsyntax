UPDATE-AVAILABILITY-OPTIONS()                    UPDATE-AVAILABILITY-OPTIONS()



NAME
       update-availability-options -

DESCRIPTION
       Configures the availability options for a domain. Enabling the Multi-AZ
       option expands an Amazon CloudSearch domain to an additional Availabil-
       ity Zone in the same Region to increase fault tolerance in the event of
       a service disruption. Changes to the Multi-AZ  option  can  take  about
       half  an  hour  to become active. For more information, see Configuring
       Availability Options in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-availability-options
          --domain-name <value>
          --multi-az | --no-multi-az
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          A string that represents the name of  a  domain.  Domain  names  are
          unique  across the domains owned by an account within an AWS region.
          Domain names start with a letter or number and can contain the  fol-
          lowing characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and - (hyphen).

       --multi-az | --no-multi-az (boolean)
          You  expand  an existing search domain to a second Availability Zone
          by setting the Multi-AZ option to true. Similarly, you can turn  off
          the Multi-AZ option to downgrade the domain to a single Availability
          Zone by setting the Multi-AZ option to false .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AvailabilityOptions -> (structure)
          The  newly-configured  availability   options.   Indicates   whether
          Multi-AZ is enabled for the domain.

          Options -> (boolean)
              The availability options configured for the domain.

          Status -> (structure)
              The status of domain configuration option.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp for when this option was created.

              UpdateDate -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp for when this option was last updated.

              UpdateVersion -> (integer)
                 A  unique  integer  that  indicates when this option was last
                 updated.

              State -> (string)
                 The state of processing a change to an option. Possible  val-
                 ues:

                 o RequiresIndexDocuments : the option's latest value will not
                   be deployed  until   IndexDocuments  has  been  called  and
                   indexing is complete.

                 o Processing : the option's latest value is in the process of
                   being activated.

                 o Active : the option's latest value is completely  deployed.

                 o FailedToValidate  : the option value is not compatible with
                   the domain's data and cannot be used to index the data. You
                   must either modify the option value or update or remove the
                   incompatible documents.

              PendingDeletion -> (boolean)
                 Indicates that the option will be deleted once processing  is
                 complete.
