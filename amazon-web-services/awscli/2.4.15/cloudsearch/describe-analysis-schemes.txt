NAME
       describe-analysis-schemes -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the  analysis schemes configured for a domain. An analysis scheme
       defines language-specific text processing options for a text field. Can
       be  limited to specific analysis schemes by name. By default, shows all
       analysis schemes and includes any pending changes to the configuration.
       Set  the  Deployed  option to true to show the active configuration and
       exclude pending changes. For more information, see Configuring Analysis
       Schemes in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-analysis-schemes
          --domain-name <value>
          [--analysis-scheme-names <value>]
          [--deployed | --no-deployed]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The name of the domain you want to describe.

       --analysis-scheme-names (list)
          The analysis schemes you want to describe.

          (string)
              Names  must  begin  with  a letter and can contain the following
              characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and _ (underscore).

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --deployed | --no-deployed (boolean)
          Whether to display the deployed configuration (true ) or include any
          pending changes (false ). Defaults to false .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AnalysisSchemes -> (list)
          The analysis scheme descriptions.

          (structure)
              The status and configuration of an AnalysisScheme .

              Options -> (structure)
                 Configuration information for an analysis scheme. Each analy-
                 sis scheme has a unique name and specifies  the  language  of
                 the  text  to be processed. The following options can be con-
                 figured for an analysis scheme: Synonyms , Stopwords ,  Stem-
                 mingDictionary , JapaneseTokenizationDictionary and Algorith-
                 micStemming .

                 AnalysisSchemeName -> (string)
                     Names must begin with a letter and can contain  the  fol-
                     lowing  characters:  a-z  (lowercase), 0-9, and _ (under-
                     score).

                 AnalysisSchemeLanguage -> (string)
                     An IETF RFC 4646 language code or mul for  multiple  lan-
                     guages.

                 AnalysisOptions -> (structure)
                     Synonyms, stopwords, and stemming options for an analysis
                     scheme. Includes tokenization dictionary for Japanese.

                     Synonyms -> (string)
                        A JSON object that defines synonym groups and aliases.
                        A  synonym  group  is  an  array of arrays, where each
                        sub-array is a group of terms where each term  in  the
                        group  is  considered a synonym of every other term in
                        the group. The aliases value is an  object  that  con-
                        tains  a  collection  of  string:value pairs where the
                        string specifies a term and the array of values speci-
                        fies  each  of  the aliases for that term. An alias is
                        considered a synonym of the specified  term,  but  the
                        term  is  not  considered  a synonym of the alias. For
                        more  information  about  specifying   synonyms,   see
                        Synonyms in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide .

                     Stopwords -> (string)
                        A  JSON  array  of terms to ignore during indexing and
                        searching. For example, ["a", "an", "the", "of"] . The
                        stopwords  dictionary  must  explicitly list each word
                        you want to ignore. Wildcards and regular  expressions
                        are not supported.

                     StemmingDictionary -> (string)
                        A   JSON   object   that   contains  a  collection  of
                        string:value pairs that each map a term to  its  stem.
                        For  example,  {"term1":  "stem1",  "term2":  "stem2",
                        "term3": "stem3"} . The stemming dictionary is applied
                        in  addition to any algorithmic stemming. This enables
                        you to override the results of the  algorithmic  stem-
                        ming  to  correct  specific  cases  of overstemming or
                        understemming. The maximum size of a stemming  dictio-
                        nary is 500 KB.

                     JapaneseTokenizationDictionary -> (string)
                        A  JSON  array  that  contains  a collection of terms,
                        tokens, readings and part of speech for Japanese  Tok-
                        enizaiton.   The   Japanese   tokenization  dictionary
                        enables you to override the default  tokenization  for
                        selected  terms.  This is only valid for Japanese lan-
                        guage fields.

                     AlgorithmicStemming -> (string)
                        The level of algorithmic stemming to perform:  none  ,
                        minimal  , light , or full . The available levels vary
                        depending on the language. For more  information,  see
                        Language Specific Text Processing Settings in the Ama-
                        zon CloudSearch Developer Guide

              Status -> (structure)
                 The status of domain configuration option.

                 CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                     A timestamp for when this option was created.

                 UpdateDate -> (timestamp)
                     A timestamp for when this option was last updated.

                 UpdateVersion -> (integer)
                     A unique integer that indicates when this option was last
                     updated.

                 State -> (string)
                     The  state  of processing a change to an option. Possible
                     values:

                     o RequiresIndexDocuments : the option's latest value will
                       not  be  deployed until  IndexDocuments has been called
                       and indexing is complete.

                     o Processing :  the  option's  latest  value  is  in  the
                       process of being activated.

                     o Active  :  the  option's  latest  value  is  completely
                       deployed.

                     o FailedToValidate : the option value is  not  compatible
                       with  the domain's data and cannot be used to index the
                       data. You must either modify the option value or update
                       or remove the incompatible documents.

                 PendingDeletion -> (boolean)
                     Indicates that the option will be deleted once processing
                     is complete.
