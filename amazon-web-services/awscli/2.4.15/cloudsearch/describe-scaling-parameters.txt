NAME
       describe-scaling-parameters -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the scaling parameters configured for a domain. A domain's scaling
       parameters specify the desired search  instance  type  and  replication
       count.  For  more  information,  see Configuring Scaling Options in the
       Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-scaling-parameters
          --domain-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          A string that represents the name of  a  domain.  Domain  names  are
          unique  across the domains owned by an account within an AWS region.
          Domain names start with a letter or number and can contain the  fol-
          lowing characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and - (hyphen).

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ScalingParameters -> (structure)
          The  status  and  configuration of a search domain's scaling parame-
          ters.

          Options -> (structure)
              The desired instance type and desired number of replicas of each
              index partition.

              DesiredInstanceType -> (string)
                 The  instance  type  that  you  want to preconfigure for your
                 domain. For example, search.m1.small .

              DesiredReplicationCount -> (integer)
                 The number of replicas you  want  to  preconfigure  for  each
                 index partition.

              DesiredPartitionCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  partitions you want to preconfigure for your
                 domain. Only valid when you select m2.2xlarge as the  desired
                 instance type.

          Status -> (structure)
              The status of domain configuration option.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp for when this option was created.

              UpdateDate -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp for when this option was last updated.

              UpdateVersion -> (integer)
                 A  unique  integer  that  indicates when this option was last
                 updated.

              State -> (string)
                 The state of processing a change to an option. Possible  val-
                 ues:

                 o RequiresIndexDocuments : the option's latest value will not
                   be deployed  until   IndexDocuments  has  been  called  and
                   indexing is complete.

                 o Processing : the option's latest value is in the process of
                   being activated.

                 o Active : the option's latest value is completely  deployed.

                 o FailedToValidate  : the option value is not compatible with
                   the domain's data and cannot be used to index the data. You
                   must either modify the option value or update or remove the
                   incompatible documents.

              PendingDeletion -> (boolean)
                 Indicates that the option will be deleted once processing  is
                 complete.
