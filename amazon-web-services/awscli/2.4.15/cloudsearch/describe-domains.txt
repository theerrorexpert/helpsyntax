DESCRIBE-DOMAINS()                                          DESCRIBE-DOMAINS()



NAME
       describe-domains -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about the search domains owned by this account. Can be
       limited to specific domains. Shows all domains by default. To  get  the
       number of searchable documents in a domain, use the console or submit a
       matchall    request    to    your     domain's     search     endpoint:
       q=matchall&amp;q.parser=structured&amp;size=0  .  For more information,
       see Getting Information about a Search Domain in the Amazon CloudSearch
       Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-domains
          [--domain-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-names (list)
          The names of the domains you want to include in the response.

          (string)
              A  string that represents the name of a domain. Domain names are
              unique across the domains owned by  an  account  within  an  AWS
              region.  Domain names start with a letter or number and can con-
              tain the following  characters:  a-z  (lowercase),  0-9,  and  -
              (hyphen).

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DomainStatusList -> (list)
          A list that contains the status of each requested domain.

          (structure)
              The current status of the search domain.

              DomainId -> (string)
                 An internally generated unique identifier for a domain.

              DomainName -> (string)
                 A  string  that represents the name of a domain. Domain names
                 are unique across the domains owned by an account  within  an
                 AWS  region.  Domain  names start with a letter or number and
                 can contain the following characters: a-z  (lowercase),  0-9,
                 and - (hyphen).

              ARN -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of the search domain. See
                 Identifiers for IAM Entities in Using AWS Identity and Access
                 Management for more information.

              Created -> (boolean)
                 True  if  the  search  domain is created. It can take several
                 minutes to initialize a domain when  CreateDomain is  called.
                 Newly  created  search domains are returned from  DescribeDo-
                 mains with a false value for Created until domain creation is
                 complete.

              Deleted -> (boolean)
                 True  if  the search domain has been deleted. The system must
                 clean up  resources  dedicated  to  the  search  domain  when
                 DeleteDomain  is  called.  Newly  deleted  search domains are
                 returned  from   DescribeDomains  with  a  true   value   for
                 IsDeleted  for several minutes until resource cleanup is com-
                 plete.

              DocService -> (structure)
                 The service endpoint  for  updating  documents  in  a  search
                 domain.

                 Endpoint -> (string)

                     jfn6ugofer3zx5iadxxca.eu-west-1.cloudsearch.amazonaws.com

                     .

              SearchService -> (structure)

              Processing -> (boolean)
                 True  if  processing  is  being  done to activate the current
