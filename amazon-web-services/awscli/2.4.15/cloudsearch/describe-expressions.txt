DESCRIBE-EXPRESSIONS()                                  DESCRIBE-EXPRESSIONS()



NAME
       describe-expressions -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the  expressions configured for the search domain. Can be limited
       to specific expressions by name. By default, shows all expressions  and
       includes  any  pending  changes  to the configuration. Set the Deployed
       option to true to show the active  configuration  and  exclude  pending
       changes.  For more information, see Configuring Expressions in the Ama-
       zon CloudSearch Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-expressions
          --domain-name <value>
          [--expression-names <value>]
          [--deployed | --no-deployed]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The name of the domain you want to describe.

       --expression-names (list)
          Limits  the  ``  DescribeExpressions``  response  to  the  specified
          expressions. If not specified, all expressions are shown.

          (string)
              Names  must  begin  with  a letter and can contain the following
              characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and _ (underscore).

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --deployed | --no-deployed (boolean)
          Whether to display the deployed configuration (true ) or include any
          pending changes (false ). Defaults to false .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Expressions -> (list)
          The expressions configured for the domain.

          (structure)
              The value of an Expression and its current status.

              Options -> (structure)
                 The expression that is evaluated for sorting while processing
                 a search request.

                 ExpressionName -> (string)
                     Names must begin with a letter and can contain  the  fol-
                     lowing  characters:  a-z  (lowercase), 0-9, and _ (under-
                     score).

                 ExpressionValue -> (string)
                     The expression to evaluate for sorting while processing a
                     search   request.  The  Expression  syntax  is  based  on
                     JavaScript  expressions.  For   more   information,   see
                     Configuring  Expressions in the Amazon CloudSearch Devel-
                     oper Guide .

              Status -> (structure)
                 The status of domain configuration option.

                 CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                     A timestamp for when this option was created.

                 UpdateDate -> (timestamp)
                     A timestamp for when this option was last updated.

                 UpdateVersion -> (integer)
                     A unique integer that indicates when this option was last
                     updated.

                 State -> (string)
                     The  state  of processing a change to an option. Possible
                     values:

                     o RequiresIndexDocuments : the option's latest value will
                       not  be  deployed until  IndexDocuments has been called
                       and indexing is complete.

                     o Processing :  the  option's  latest  value  is  in  the
                       process of being activated.

                     o Active  :  the  option's  latest  value  is  completely
                       deployed.

                     o FailedToValidate : the option value is  not  compatible
                       with  the domain's data and cannot be used to index the
                       data. You must either modify the option value or update
                       or remove the incompatible documents.

                 PendingDeletion -> (boolean)
                     Indicates that the option will be deleted once processing
                     is complete.
