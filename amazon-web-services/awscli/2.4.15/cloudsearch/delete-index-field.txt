DELETE-INDEX-FIELD()                                      DELETE-INDEX-FIELD()



NAME
       delete-index-field -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  an  ``  IndexField`` from the search domain. For more informa-
       tion, see Configuring Index Fields in the Amazon CloudSearch  Developer
       Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-index-field
          --domain-name <value>
          --index-field-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          A  string  that  represents  the  name of a domain. Domain names are
          unique across the domains owned by an account within an AWS  region.
          Domain  names start with a letter or number and can contain the fol-
          lowing characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and - (hyphen).

       --index-field-name (string)
          The name of the index field your want to remove  from  the  domain's
          indexing options.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       IndexField -> (structure)
          The status of the index field being deleted.

          Options -> (structure)
              Configuration  information  for  a field in the index, including
              its name, type, and options. The supported options depend on the
              `` IndexFieldType`` .

              IndexFieldName -> (string)
                 A  string  that represents the name of an index field. Cloud-
                 Search supports regular  index  fields  as  well  as  dynamic
                 fields.  A dynamic field's name defines a pattern that begins
                 or ends with a wildcard. Any document fields that  don't  map
                 to  a regular index field but do match a dynamic field's pat-
                 tern  are  configured  with  the  dynamic  field's   indexing
                 options.

                 Regular  field  names begin with a letter and can contain the
                 following characters: a-z (lowercase),  0-9,  and  _  (under-
                 score). Dynamic field names must begin or end with a wildcard
                 (*). The wildcard can also be the only character in a dynamic
                 field name. Multiple wildcards, and wildcards embedded within
                 a string are not supported.

                 The name score is reserved and cannot  be  used  as  a  field
                 name.  To reference a document's ID, you can use the name _id
                 .

              IndexFieldType -> (string)
                 The type of field. The valid options for a  field  depend  on
                 the  field  type.  For  more  information about the supported
                 field types, see  Configuring  Index  Fields  in  the  Amazon
                 CloudSearch Developer Guide .

              IntOptions -> (structure)

                     for a document. This can be important if  you  are  using
                     the  field in an expression and that field is not present
                     in every document.

                     A value to use for the field if the field isn't specified
                     for a document. This can be important if  you  are  using

                 SourceField -> (string)
                     A string that represents the  name  of  an  index  field.
                     CloudSearch  supports  regular  index  fields  as well as
                     dynamic fields. A dynamic field's name defines a  pattern
                     that  begins or ends with a wildcard. Any document fields
                     that don't map to a regular index field but  do  match  a
                     dynamic  field's  pattern are configured with the dynamic
                     field's indexing options.

                     Regular field names begin with a letter and  can  contain
                     the  following  characters:  a-z  (lowercase), 0-9, and _
                     (underscore). Dynamic field names must begin or end  with
                     a wildcard (*). The wildcard can also be the only charac-
                     ter in a dynamic  field  name.  Multiple  wildcards,  and
                     wildcards embedded within a string are not supported.

                     The  name score is reserved and cannot be used as a field
                     name. To reference a document's ID, you can use the  name
                     _id .

                 FacetEnabled -> (boolean)
                     Whether  facet information can be returned for the field.

                 SortEnabled -> (boolean)
                     Whether the field can be used to sort the search results.

              TextOptions -> (structure)
                 Options for text field. Present if  IndexFieldType  specifies
                 the  field  is  of type text . A text field is always search-
                 able. All options are enabled by default.

                 DefaultValue -> (string)
                     A value to use for the field if the field isn't specified
                     for a document.

                     CloudSearch supports regular  index  fields  as  well  as
                     dynamic  fields. A dynamic field's name defines a pattern

                     (underscore).  Dynamic field names must begin or end with
                     a wildcard (*). The wildcard can also be the only charac-
                     ter  in  a  dynamic  field  name. Multiple wildcards, and
                     wildcards embedded within a string are not supported.

                 yyyy-mm-ddT00:00:00Z. Present if IndexFieldType specifies the
                 field is of type date . All options are enabled by default.

                 DefaultValue -> (string)
                     A value to use for the field if the field isn't specified

                     CloudSearch  supports  regular  index  fields  as well as
                     dynamic fields. A dynamic field's name defines a  pattern
