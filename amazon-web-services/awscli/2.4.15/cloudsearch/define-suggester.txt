DEFINE-SUGGESTER()                                          DEFINE-SUGGESTER()



NAME
       define-suggester -

DESCRIPTION
       Configures a suggester for a domain. A suggester enables you to display
       possible matches before users finish typing  their  queries.  When  you
       configure  a suggester, you must specify the name of the text field you
       want to search for possible matches and a  unique  name  for  the  sug-
       gester.  For  more  information,  see Getting Search Suggestions in the
       Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            define-suggester
          --domain-name <value>
          --suggester <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          A string that represents the name of  a  domain.  Domain  names  are
          unique  across the domains owned by an account within an AWS region.
          Domain names start with a letter or number and can contain the  fol-
          lowing characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and - (hyphen).

       --suggester (structure)
          Configuration information for a search suggester. Each suggester has
          a unique name and specifies the text field you want to use for  sug-
          gestions.  The  following options can be configured for a suggester:
          FuzzyMatching , SortExpression .

          SuggesterName -> (string)
              Names must begin with a letter and  can  contain  the  following
              characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and _ (underscore).

          DocumentSuggesterOptions -> (structure)
              Options for a search suggester.

              SourceField -> (string)
                 The  name of the index field you want to use for suggestions.

              FuzzyMatching -> (string)
                 The level of fuzziness allowed when suggesting matches for  a
                 string:  none  ,  low  ,  or  high . With none, the specified
                 string is treated as an exact prefix. With  low,  suggestions
                 must  differ  from  the  specified string by no more than one
                 character. With high, suggestions can differ  by  up  to  two
                 characters. The default is none.

              SortExpression -> (string)
                 An  expression  that  computes a score for each suggestion to
                 control how they are sorted. The scores are  rounded  to  the
                 nearest integer, with a floor of 0 and a ceiling of 2^31-1. A
                 document's relevance score is not computed  for  suggestions,
                 so  sort  expressions  cannot  reference the _score value. To
                 sort suggestions using a numeric field  or  existing  expres-
                 sion,  simply specify the name of the field or expression. If
                 no expression is configured for the  suggester,  the  sugges-
                 tions are sorted with the closest matches listed first.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SuggesterName=string,DocumentSuggesterOptions={SourceField=string,FuzzyMatching=string,SortExpression=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SuggesterName": "string",
            "DocumentSuggesterOptions": {
              "SourceField": "string",
              "FuzzyMatching": "none"|"low"|"high",
              "SortExpression": "string"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Suggester -> (structure)
          The value of a Suggester and its current status.

          Options -> (structure)
              Configuration information for a search suggester. Each suggester
              has a unique name and specifies the text field you want  to  use
              for  suggestions.  The following options can be configured for a
              suggester: FuzzyMatching , SortExpression .

              SuggesterName -> (string)
                 Names must begin with a letter and can contain the  following
                 characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and _ (underscore).

              DocumentSuggesterOptions -> (structure)
                 Options for a search suggester.

                 SourceField -> (string)
                     The  name  of the index field you want to use for sugges-
                     tions.

                 FuzzyMatching -> (string)
                     The level of fuzziness allowed  when  suggesting  matches
                     for a string: none , low , or high . With none, the spec-
                     ified string is treated as an  exact  prefix.  With  low,
                     suggestions  must  differ from the specified string by no
                     more than one character. With high, suggestions can  dif-
                     fer by up to two characters. The default is none.

                 SortExpression -> (string)
                     An  expression  that computes a score for each suggestion
                     to control how they are sorted. The scores are rounded to
                     the  nearest  integer, with a floor of 0 and a ceiling of
                     2^31-1. A document's relevance score is not computed  for
                     suggestions,  so  sort  expressions  cannot reference the
                     _score value. To sort suggestions using a  numeric  field
                     or  existing  expression,  simply specify the name of the
                     field or expression. If no expression is  configured  for
                     the  suggester, the suggestions are sorted with the clos-
                     est matches listed first.

          Status -> (structure)
              The status of domain configuration option.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp for when this option was created.

              UpdateDate -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp for when this option was last updated.

              UpdateVersion -> (integer)
                 A unique integer that indicates when  this  option  was  last
                 updated.

              State -> (string)
                 The  state of processing a change to an option. Possible val-
                 ues:

                 o RequiresIndexDocuments : the option's latest value will not
                   be  deployed  until   IndexDocuments  has  been  called and
                   indexing is complete.

                 o Processing : the option's latest value is in the process of
                   being activated.

                 o Active  : the option's latest value is completely deployed.

                 o FailedToValidate : the option value is not compatible  with
                   the domain's data and cannot be used to index the data. You
                   must either modify the option value or update or remove the
                   incompatible documents.

              PendingDeletion -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  that the option will be deleted once processing is
                 complete.
