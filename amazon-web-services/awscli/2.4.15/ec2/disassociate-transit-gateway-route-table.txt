NAME
       disassociate-transit-gateway-route-table -

DESCRIPTION
       Disassociates a resource attachment from a transit gateway route table.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disassociate-transit-gateway-route-table
          --transit-gateway-route-table-id <value>
          --transit-gateway-attachment-id <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --transit-gateway-route-table-id (string)
          The ID of the transit gateway route table.

       --transit-gateway-attachment-id (string)
          The ID of the attachment.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To  disassociate a transit gateway route table from a  resource attach-
       ment

       The following disassociate-transit-gateway-route-table example disasso-
       ciates the specified attachment from the transit gateway route table.

          aws ec2 disassociate-transit-gateway-route-table \
              --transit-gateway-route-table-id tgw-rtb-002573ed1eEXAMPLE \
              --transit-gateway-attachment-id tgw-attach-08e0bc912cEXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "Association": {
                  "TransitGatewayRouteTableId": "tgw-rtb-002573ed1eEXAMPLE",
                  "TransitGatewayAttachmentId": "tgw-attach-08e0bc912cEXAMPLE",
                  "ResourceId": "11460968-4ac1-4fd3-bdb2-00599EXAMPLE",

              }
          }
