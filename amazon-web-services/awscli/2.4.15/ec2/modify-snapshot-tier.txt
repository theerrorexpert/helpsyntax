MODIFY-SNAPSHOT-TIER()                                  MODIFY-SNAPSHOT-TIER()



NAME
       modify-snapshot-tier -

DESCRIPTION
       Archives  an  Amazon  EBS  snapshot. When you archive a snapshot, it is
       converted to a full snapshot that includes all of the  blocks  of  data
       that  were  written to the volume at the time the snapshot was created,
       and moved from the standard tier to the archive tier. For more informa-
       tion,  see  Archive  Amazon EBS snapshots in the Amazon Elastic Compute
       Cloud User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-snapshot-tier
          --snapshot-id <value>
          [--storage-tier <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --snapshot-id (string)
          The ID of the snapshot.

       --storage-tier (string)
          The name of the storage tier. You must specify archive .

          Possible values:

          o archive

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SnapshotId -> (string)
          The ID of the snapshot.

       TieringStartTime -> (timestamp)
          The date and time when the archive process was started.
