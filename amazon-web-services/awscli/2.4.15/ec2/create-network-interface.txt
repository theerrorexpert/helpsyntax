OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          A description for the network interface.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --groups (list)
          The IDs of one or more security groups.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --ipv6-address-count (integer)
          The  number of IPv6 addresses to assign to a network interface. Ama-
          zon EC2 automatically selects the IPv6  addresses  from  the  subnet
          range.  You  can't  use  this  option  if  specifying  specific IPv6
          addresses.  If  your  subnet  has  the   AssignIpv6AddressOnCreation
          attribute  set to true , you can specify 0 to override this setting.

       --ipv6-addresses (list)
          One or more specific IPv6 addresses from the IPv6 CIDR  block  range
          of  your  subnet.  You  can't use this option if you're specifying a
          number of IPv6 addresses.

          (structure)
              Describes an IPv6 address.

              Ipv6Address -> (string)
                 The IPv6 address.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Ipv6Address=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Ipv6Address": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --private-ip-address (string)
          The primary private IPv4 address of the network  interface.  If  you
          don't  specify  an IPv4 address, Amazon EC2 selects one for you from
          the subnet's IPv4 CIDR range. If you specify an IP address, you can-
          not  indicate  any  IP  addresses specified in privateIpAddresses as
          primary (only one IP address can be designated as primary).

       --private-ip-addresses (list)
          One or more private IPv4 addresses.

          (structure)
              Describes a secondary private IPv4 address for a network  inter-
              face.

              Primary -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  the  private  IPv4 address is the primary
                 private IPv4 address. Only one IPv4 address can be designated
                 as primary.

              PrivateIpAddress -> (string)
                 The private IPv4 addresses.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Primary=boolean,PrivateIpAddress=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Primary": true|false,
              "PrivateIpAddress": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --secondary-private-ip-address-count (integer)
          The  number  of secondary private IPv4 addresses to assign to a net-
          work  interface.  When  you  specify  a  number  of  secondary  IPv4
          addresses, Amazon EC2 selects these IP addresses within the subnet's
          IPv4 CIDR range. You can't specify this option and specify more than
          one private IP address using privateIpAddresses .

          The  number  of  IP  addresses you can assign to a network interface
          varies by instance type. For more information, see IP Addresses  Per
          ENI Per Instance Type in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide
          .

       --ipv4-prefixes (list)
          One or more IPv4 prefixes assigned to  the  network  interface.  You
          cannot use this option if you use the Ipv4PrefixCount option.

          (structure)
              Describes the IPv4 prefix option for a network interface.

              Ipv4Prefix -> (string)
                 The  IPv4  prefix. For information, see Assigning prefixes to
                 Amazon EC2 network interfaces in the Amazon  Elastic  Compute
                 Cloud User Guide .

            ...
          ]

       --ipv4-prefix-count (integer)
          The  number  of IPv4 prefixes that Amazon Web Services automatically
          assigns to the network interface. You cannot use this option if  you
          use the Ipv4 Prefixes option.

       --ipv6-prefixes (list)
          One  or  more  IPv6  prefixes assigned to the network interface. You
          cannot use this option if you use the Ipv6PrefixCount option.

            }
            ...
          ]

       --ipv6-prefix-count (integer)
          The number of IPv6 prefixes that Amazon Web  Services  automatically
          assigns  to the network interface. You cannot use this option if you
          use the Ipv6Prefixes option.

       --interface-type (string)
          Indicates the type of network interface. To create an Elastic Fabric
          Adapter  (EFA), specify efa . For more information, see Elastic Fab-

       --client-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive  identifier  that  you provide to ensure the

          potency .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

                     Indicates whether this IPv4 address is the  primary  pri-
                     vate IPv4 address of the network interface.

              (structure)
                 Describes an IPv4 prefix.

                 Ipv4Prefix -> (string)
                     The  IPv4 prefix. For information, see Assigning prefixes
                     to Amazon EC2 network interfaces in  the  Amazon  Elastic
                     Compute Cloud User Guide .

          Ipv6Prefixes -> (list)
              The IPv6 prefixes that are assigned to the network interface.

              (structure)
                 Describes the IPv6 prefix.

                 Ipv6Prefix -> (string)
                     The IPv6 prefix.

          RequesterId -> (string)
              The  alias or Amazon Web Services account ID of the principal or
              service that created the network interface.

          RequesterManaged -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether the network interface is being managed by Ama-
              zon Web Services.

          SourceDestCheck -> (boolean)

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the network interface.

          SubnetId -> (string)
              The ID of the subnet.

          TagSet -> (list)
              Any tags assigned to the network interface.

              (structure)
                 Describes a tag.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key of the tag.

                     Constraints:  Tag  keys  are  case-sensitive and accept a
                     maximum of 127 Unicode characters.  May  not  begin  with
                     aws: .

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value of the tag.

                     Constraints:  Tag  values are case-sensitive and accept a
                     maximum of 255 Unicode characters.

          VpcId -> (string)
              The ID of the VPC.

          DenyAllIgwTraffic -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether a network interface with an  IPv6  address  is
              unreachable  from  the  public  internet. If the value is true ,
              inbound traffic from the internet  is  dropped  and  you  cannot
              assign  an elastic IP address to the network interface. The net-
              work interface is reachable from peered VPCs and resources  con-
              nected  through  a  transit  gateway, including on-premises net-
              works.

          Ipv6Native -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether this is an IPv6 only network interface.

          Ipv6Address -> (string)
              The IPv6 globally unique address  associated  with  the  network
              interface.

          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is
          null when there are no more results to return.
