ASSIGN-PRIVATE-IP-ADDRESSES()                    ASSIGN-PRIVATE-IP-ADDRESSES()



NAME
       assign-private-ip-addresses -

DESCRIPTION
       Assigns  one  or  more  secondary private IP addresses to the specified
       network interface.

       You can specify one or more specific secondary IP addresses, or you can
       specify  the  number  of  secondary  IP  addresses  to be automatically
       assigned within the subnet's CIDR block range. The number of  secondary
       IP  addresses  that  you  can  assign to an instance varies by instance
       type. For information about instance types, see Instance Types  in  the
       Amazon  Elastic  Compute  Cloud User Guide . For more information about
       Elastic IP addresses, see Elastic IP Addresses in  the  Amazon  Elastic
       Compute Cloud User Guide .

       When  you move a secondary private IP address to another network inter-
       face, any Elastic IP address that is associated with the IP address  is
       also moved.

       Remapping  an IP address is an asynchronous operation. When you move an
       IP address from one network interface to another, check  network/inter-
       faces/macs/mac/local-ipv4s in the instance metadata to confirm that the
       remapping is complete.

       You must specify either the IP addresses or the IP address count in the
       request.

       You  can optionally use Prefix Delegation on the network interface. You
       must specify either the IPv4 Prefix Delegation prefixes,  or  the  IPv4
       Prefix  Delegation  count.  For  information, see Assigning prefixes to
       Amazon EC2 network interfaces in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud  User
       Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            assign-private-ip-addresses
          [--allow-reassignment | --no-allow-reassignment]
          --network-interface-id <value>
          [--private-ip-addresses <value>]
          [--secondary-private-ip-address-count <value>]
          [--ipv4-prefixes <value>]
          [--ipv4-prefix-count <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --allow-reassignment | --no-allow-reassignment (boolean)
          Indicates whether to allow an IP address that is already assigned to
          another network interface or instance to be reassigned to the speci-
          fied network interface.

       --network-interface-id (string)
          The ID of the network interface.

       --private-ip-addresses (list)
          One  or  more  IP addresses to be assigned as a secondary private IP
          address to the network interface. You can't specify  this  parameter
          when also specifying a number of secondary IP addresses.

          If you don't specify an IP address, Amazon EC2 automatically selects
          an IP address within the subnet range.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --secondary-private-ip-address-count (integer)
          The number of secondary IP addresses to assign to the network inter-
          face.  You can't specify this parameter when also specifying private
          IP addresses.

       --ipv4-prefixes (list)
          One or more IPv4 prefixes assigned to  the  network  interface.  You
          cannot use this option if you use the Ipv4PrefixCount option.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --ipv4-prefix-count (integer)
          The  number  of IPv4 prefixes that Amazon Web Services automatically
          assigns to the network interface. You cannot use this option if  you
          use the Ipv4 Prefixes option.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To assign a specific secondary private IP address a network interface

       This  example assigns the specified secondary private IP address to the
       specified network interface. If the  command  succeeds,  no  output  is
       returned.

       Command:

          aws ec2 assign-private-ip-addresses --network-interface-id eni-e5aa89a3 --private-ip-addresses 10.0.0.82

       To  assign  secondary private IP addresses that Amazon EC2 selects to a
       network interface

       This example assigns two secondary private IP addresses to  the  speci-
       fied  network  interface.  Amazon  EC2  automatically  assigns these IP
       addresses from the available IP addresses in the CIDR  block  range  of
       the  subnet  the  network  interface is associated with. If the command
       succeeds, no output is returned.

       Command:

          aws ec2 assign-private-ip-addresses --network-interface-id eni-e5aa89a3 --secondary-private-ip-address-count 2

          The ID of the network interface.

          The private IP addresses assigned to the network interface.

          (structure)

              face.

              PrivateIpAddress -> (string)
                 The private IP address assigned to the network interface.
