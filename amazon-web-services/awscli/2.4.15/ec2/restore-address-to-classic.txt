RESTORE-ADDRESS-TO-CLASSIC()                      RESTORE-ADDRESS-TO-CLASSIC()



NAME
       restore-address-to-classic -

DESCRIPTION
       Restores an Elastic IP address that was previously moved to the EC2-VPC
       platform back to the EC2-Classic platform. You cannot move  an  Elastic
       IP  address that was originally allocated for use in EC2-VPC. The Elas-
       tic IP address must not be  associated  with  an  instance  or  network
       interface.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            restore-address-to-classic
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          --public-ip <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --public-ip (string)
          The Elastic IP address.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

            "Status": "MoveInProgress",
            "PublicIp": "198.51.100.0"
          }
