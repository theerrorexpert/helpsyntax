DESCRIBE-NETWORK-ACLS()                                DESCRIBE-NETWORK-ACLS()



NAME
       describe-network-acls -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes one or more of your network ACLs.

       For  more  information,  see Network ACLs in the Amazon Virtual Private
       Cloud User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-network-acls is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: NetworkAcls

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          One or more filters.

          o association.association-id  -  The ID of an association ID for the
            ACL.

          o association.network-acl-id - The ID of the network ACL involved in
            the association.

          o association.subnet-id - The ID of the subnet involved in the asso-
            ciation.

          o default - Indicates whether the ACL is the default network ACL for
            the VPC.

          o entry.cidr - The IPv4 CIDR range specified in the entry.

          o entry.icmp.code - The ICMP code specified in the entry, if any.

          o entry.icmp.type - The ICMP type specified in the entry, if any.

          o entry.ipv6-cidr - The IPv6 CIDR range specified in the entry.

          o entry.port-range.from  -  The start of the port range specified in
            the entry.

          o entry.port-range.to - The end of the port range specified  in  the
            entry.

          o entry.protocol  - The protocol specified in the entry (tcp | udp |
            icmp or a protocol number).

          o entry.rule-action - Allows or denies the matching traffic (allow |
            deny ).

          o entry.rule-number  - The number of an entry (in other words, rule)
            in the set of ACL entries.

          o network-acl-id - The ID of the network ACL.

          o owner-id - The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the
            network ACL.

          o tag  :<key>  -  The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the
            resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value  as
            the  filter  value. For example, to find all resources that have a
            tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA , specify tag:Owner for
            the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

          o tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this fil-
            ter to find all resources assigned a  tag  with  a  specific  key,
            regardless of the tag value.

          o vpc-id - The ID of the VPC for the network ACL.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --network-acl-ids (list)
          One or more network ACL IDs.

          Default: Describes all your network ACLs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
