OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you  provide  to  ensure  the
          idempotency of the request. For more information, see Ensuring Idem-
          potency .

       --currency-code (string)
          The currency in which  the  totalUpfrontPrice  ,  LimitPrice  ,  and
          totalHourlyPrice  amounts are specified. At this time, the only sup-
          ported currency is USD .

          Possible values:

          o USD

       --host-id-set (list)
          The IDs of the Dedicated Hosts with which the  reservation  will  be

       --limit-price (string)

          ified price limit, the request fails. This is used  to  ensure  that
          the  purchase  does not exceed the expected upfront cost of the pur-
          chase. At this time, the only supported currency is USD . For  exam-
          ple, to indicate a limit price of USD 100, specify 100.00.

          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
