NAME
       describe-launch-template-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  one or more versions of a specified launch template. You can
       describe all versions, individual versions, or a range of versions. You
       can  also  describe all the latest versions or all the default versions
       of all the launch templates in your account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-launch-template-versions is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple
       API  calls  may  be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: LaunchTemplateVersions

          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--launch-template-id <value>]
          [--launch-template-name <value>]
          [--versions <value>]
          [--min-version <value>]
          [--max-version <value>]
          [--filters <value>]

          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --launch-template-id (string)
          The ID of the launch template. To describe one or more versions of a
          specified  launch  template, you must specify either the launch tem-
          plate ID or the launch template name in the request. To describe all
          the  latest or default launch template versions in your account, you
          must omit this parameter.

       --launch-template-name (string)
          The name of the launch template. To describe one or more versions of
          a specified launch template, you must specify either the launch tem-
          plate ID or the launch template name in the request. To describe all
          the  latest or default launch template versions in your account, you
          must omit this parameter.

       --versions (list)
          One or more versions of the launch template. Valid values depend  on
          whether  you  are  describing  a specified launch template (by ID or
          name) or all launch templates in your account.

          To describe one or more versions of  a  specified  launch  template,
          valid values are $Latest , $Default , and numbers.

          To describe all launch templates in your account that are defined as
          the latest version, the valid value is $Latest  .  To  describe  all
          launch  templates  in  your  account that are defined as the default
          version, the valid value is $Default . You can specify  $Latest  and
          $Default in the same call. You cannot specify numbers.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --min-version (string)
          The version number after which to describe launch template versions.

       --max-version (string)
          The version number up to which to describe launch template versions.

       --filters (list)
          One or more filters.

          o create-time - The time the launch template version was created.

          o ebs-optimized  -  A boolean that indicates whether the instance is
            optimized for Amazon EBS I/O.

            your instances is enabled (enabled | disabled ).

          o http-protocol-ipv4  -  Indicates whether the IPv4 endpoint for the
            instance metadata service is enabled (enabled | disabled ).

          o host-resource-group-arn - The ARN of the host  resource  group  in
            which to launch the instances.

          o http-tokens  - The state of token usage for your instance metadata
            requests (optional | required ).

          o iam-instance-profile - The ARN of the IAM instance profile.

          o image-id - The ID of the AMI.

          o instance-type - The instance type.

          o is-default-version - A boolean that indicates whether  the  launch
            template version is the default version.

          o kernel-id - The kernel ID.

          o license-configuration-arn  - The ARN of the license configuration.

          o network-card-index - The index of the network card.

          o ram-disk-id - The RAM disk ID.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     tion,  see  Instance metadata and user data in the Amazon
                     Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

                     State -> (string)
                        The state of the metadata option changes.
                            pending - The metadata options are  being  updated
                            and  the instance is not ready to process metadata
                            traffic with the new selection.

                            applied - The metadata options have been  success-
                            fully applied on the instance.

                     HttpTokens -> (string)
                        The  state  of  token usage for your instance metadata
                        requests. If the parameter is  not  specified  in  the
                        request, the default state is optional .

                        If  the state is optional , you can choose to retrieve
                        instance metadata  with  or  without  a  signed  token
                        header  on  your request. If you retrieve the IAM role
                        credentials without a token, the version 1.0 role cre-
                        dentials  are  returned.  If you retrieve the IAM role
                        credentials using a valid signed  token,  the  version
                        2.0 role credentials are returned.

                        If  the  state  is  required  , you must send a signed
                        token header  with  any  instance  metadata  retrieval
                        requests.  In this state, retrieving the IAM role cre-
                        dentials always returns the version  2.0  credentials;
                        the version 1.0 credentials are not available.

                     HttpPutResponseHopLimit -> (integer)
                        The  desired  HTTP PUT response hop limit for instance
                        metadata requests. The larger the number, the  further
                        instance metadata requests can travel.

                        Default: 1

                        Possible values: Integers from 1 to 64
