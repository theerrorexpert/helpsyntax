SEND-DIAGNOSTIC-INTERRUPT()                        SEND-DIAGNOSTIC-INTERRUPT()



NAME
       send-diagnostic-interrupt -

DESCRIPTION
       Sends  a  diagnostic  interrupt to the specified Amazon EC2 instance to
       trigger a kernel panic (on Linux instances), or  a  blue  screen  /stop
       error (on Windows instances). For instances based on Intel and AMD pro-
       cessors, the interrupt is received as a non-maskable interrupt (NMI).

       In general, the operating system crashes  and  reboots  when  a  kernel
       panic or stop error is triggered. The operating system can also be con-
       figured to perform diagnostic tasks, such as generating a  memory  dump
       file, loading a secondary kernel, or obtaining a call trace.

       Before sending a diagnostic interrupt to your instance, ensure that its
       operating system is  configured  to  perform  the  required  diagnostic
       tasks.

       For  more information about configuring your operating system to gener-
       ate a crash dump when a kernel panic or stop error occurs, see  Send  a
       diagnostic  interrupt  (for advanced users) (Linux instances) or Send a
       diagnostic interrupt (for advanced users) (Windows instances).

SYNOPSIS
            send-diagnostic-interrupt
          --instance-id <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The ID of the instance.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To send a diagnostic interrupt

       The  following  send-diagnostic-interrupt  example  sends  a diagnostic
       interrupt to the specified instance.

          aws ec2 send-diagnostic-interrupt \
              --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       None
