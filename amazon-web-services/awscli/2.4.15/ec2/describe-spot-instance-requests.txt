NAME
       describe-spot-instance-requests -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the specified Spot Instance requests.

       You  can  use  DescribeSpotInstanceRequests  to  find  a  running  Spot
       Instance by examining the response. If the status of the Spot  Instance
       is fulfilled , the instance ID appears in the response and contains the
       identifier   of   the   instance.   Alternatively,    you    can    use
       DescribeInstances  with  a  filter  to  look  for  instances  where the
       instance lifecycle is spot .

       We recommend that you set MaxResults to a value between 5 and  1000  to
       limit  the number of results returned. This paginates the output, which
       makes the list more manageable and returns the results faster.  If  the
       list  of  results  exceeds  your  MaxResults value, then that number of
       results is returned along with a NextToken value that can be passed  to
       a  subsequent  DescribeSpotInstanceRequests  request  to  retrieve  the
       remaining results.

       Spot Instance requests are deleted four hours after they  are  canceled
       and their instances are terminated.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-spot-instance-requests  is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: SpotInstanceRequests

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --spot-instance-request-ids (list)
          One or more Spot Instance request IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       Example 2: To describe Spot Instance requests based on filters

       The following describe-spot-instance-requests example uses  filters  to
       scope the results to Spot Instance requests with the specified instance
       type in the specified Availability Zone. The example uses  the  --query
       parameter to display only the instance IDs.

          aws ec2 describe-spot-instance-requests \
              --filters Name=launch.instance-type,Values=m3.medium Name=launched-availability-zone,Values=us-east-2a \
              --query "SpotInstanceRequests[*].[InstanceId]" \
              --output text

       Output:

          i-057750d42936e468a
          i-001efd250faaa6ffa
          i-027552a73f021f3bd
          ...

       For  additional  examples using filters, see Listing and filtering your
       resources in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

       Example 3: To describe Spot Instance requests based on tags

       The following describe-spot-instance-requests example uses tag  filters
       to  scope  the  results  to  Spot  Instance  requests that have the tag
       cost-center=cc123.

          aws ec2 describe-spot-instance-requests \
              --filters Name=tag:cost-center,Values=cc123

                     (structure)
                        Describes a block device mapping,  which  defines  the
                        EBS volumes and instance store volumes to attach to an
                        instance at launch.

                        DeviceName -> (string)
                            The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh  ).

                        VirtualName -> (string)
                            The  virtual  device  name (ephemeral N). Instance
                            store volumes are numbered  starting  from  0.  An
                            instance type with 2 available instance store vol-
                            umes  can  specify  mappings  for  ephemeral0  and
                            ephemeral1  .  The  number  of  available instance
                            store volumes depends on the instance type.  After
                            you  connect  to  the instance, you must mount the
                            volume.

                            NVMe instance store volumes are automatically enu-
                            merated and assigned a device name. Including them
                            in your block device mapping has no effect.

                            Constraints: For M3 instances,  you  must  specify
                            instance store volumes in the block device mapping
                            for the instance. When you launch an M3  instance,
                            we  ignore any instance store volumes specified in
                            the block device mapping for the AMI.

                        Ebs -> (structure)
                            Parameters used to automatically set up  EBS  vol-
                            umes when the instance is launched.

                            DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                               Indicates  whether the EBS volume is deleted on
                               instance termination. For more information, see
                               Preserving  Amazon EBS volumes on instance ter-
                               mination in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

                            Iops -> (integer)
                               The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS).
                               For  gp3  ,  io1 , and io2 volumes, this repre-
                               sents the number of IOPS that  are  provisioned
                               for  the  volume.  For gp2 volumes, this repre-
                               sents the baseline performance  of  the  volume
                               and  the  rate  at which the volume accumulates
                               I/O credits for bursting.

                               The following are the supported values for each
                               volume type:

                               o gp3 : 3,000-16,000 IOPS

                               o io1 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                               o io2 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                               For  io1  and  io2 volumes, we guarantee 64,000
                               IOPS only for Instances built on the Nitro Sys-
                               tem . Other instance families guarantee perfor-
                               mance up to 32,000 IOPS.

                               This parameter is required for io1 and io2 vol-
                               umes.  The  default  for  gp3  volumes is 3,000
                               IOPS. This parameter is not supported for gp2 ,
                               st1 , sc1 , or standard volumes.

                            SnapshotId -> (string)
                               The ID of the snapshot.

                            VolumeSize -> (integer)
                               The size of the volume, in GiBs. You must spec-
                               ify either a snapshot ID or a volume  size.  If
                               you  specify  a  snapshot,  the  default is the
                               snapshot size. You can specify  a  volume  size
                               that  is  equal  to or larger than the snapshot
                               size.

                               The following are the supported  volumes  sizes
                               for each volume type:

                               o gp2 and gp3 :1-16,384

                               o io1 and io2 : 4-16,384

                               o st1 and sc1 : 125-16,384

                               o standard : 1-1,024

                            VolumeType -> (string)
                               The  volume  type.  For  more  information, see
                               Amazon EBS volume types in the Amazon EC2  User
                               Guide  . If the volume type is io1 or io2 , you
                               must specify the IOPS that the volume supports.

                            KmsKeyId -> (string)
                               Identifier (key ID, key alias, ID ARN, or alias
                               ARN) for a customer managed CMK under which the
                               EBS volume is encrypted.

                               This  parameter  is  only supported on BlockDe-
                               viceMapping objects called  by  RunInstances  ,
                               RequestSpotFleet , and RequestSpotInstances .

                            Throughput -> (integer)
                               The  throughput  that  the  volume supports, in
                               MiB/s.

                               This parameter is valid only for gp3 volumes.

                               Valid Range:  Minimum  value  of  125.  Maximum
                               value of 1000.

                            OutpostArn -> (string)
                               The ARN of the Outpost on which the snapshot is
                               stored.

                            Encrypted -> (boolean)
                               Indicates whether the encryption  state  of  an
                               EBS volume is changed while being restored from
                               a backing snapshot. The effect of  setting  the
                               encryption  state to true depends on the volume
                               origin  (new  or  from  a  snapshot),  starting
                               encryption   state,   ownership,   and  whether
                               encryption by  default  is  enabled.  For  more
                               information,  see  Amazon EBS encryption in the
                               Amazon EC2 User Guide .

                               In no case can you remove  encryption  from  an
                               encrypted volume.

                               Encrypted  volumes  can  only  be  attached  to
                               instances that support Amazon  EBS  encryption.

                               types .

                               This parameter is not returned by .

                        NoDevice -> (string)
                            To omit the device from the block device  mapping,
                            specify  an  empty  string.  When this property is
                            specified, the device is removed  from  the  block
                            device mapping regardless of the assigned value.

                 EbsOptimized -> (boolean)
                     Indicates  whether the instance is optimized for EBS I/O.
                     This optimization provides dedicated throughput to Amazon
                     EBS and an optimized configuration stack to provide opti-
                     mal EBS I/O performance. This optimization  isn't  avail-
                     able  with  all  instance types. Additional usage charges
                     apply when using an EBS Optimized instance.

                     Default: false

                 IamInstanceProfile -> (structure)
                     The IAM instance profile.

                     Arn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  instance  pro-
                        file.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the instance profile.

                 ImageId -> (string)
                     The ID of the AMI.

                 InstanceType -> (string)
                     The instance type.

                 KernelId -> (string)
                     The ID of the kernel.

                 KeyName -> (string)
                     The name of the key pair.

                 NetworkInterfaces -> (list)
                     One  or more network interfaces. If you specify a network
                     interface, you must specify subnet IDs and security group
                     IDs using the network interface.

                     (structure)
                        Describes a network interface.

                        AssociatePublicIpAddress -> (boolean)
                            Indicates  whether to assign a public IPv4 address
                            to an instance you launch in a VPC. The public  IP
                            address  can  only be assigned to a network inter-
                            face for eth0, and can only be assigned to  a  new
                            network interface, not an existing one. You cannot
                            specify more than one  network  interface  in  the
                            request.  If  launching into a default subnet, the
                            default value is true .

                        DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                            If set to true , the interface is deleted when the
                            instance  is terminated. You can specify true only
                            if creating a new network interface when launching
                            an instance.

                        Description -> (string)
                            The  description of the network interface. Applies
                            only if creating a network interface when  launch-
                            ing an instance.

                        DeviceIndex -> (integer)
                            The  position  of  the  network  interface  in the
                            attachment order. A primary network interface  has
                            a device index of 0.

                            If  you specify a network interface when launching
                            an instance, you must specify the device index.

                        Groups -> (list)
                            The IDs of the security  groups  for  the  network
                            interface.  Applies  only  if  creating  a network
                            interface when launching an instance.

                            (string)

                        Ipv6AddressCount -> (integer)
                            A number of IPv6 addresses to assign to  the  net-
                            work   interface.  Amazon  EC2  chooses  the  IPv6
                            addresses from the range of the subnet. You cannot
                            specify  this option and the option to assign spe-
                            cific IPv6 addresses in the same request. You  can
                            specify  this option if you've specified a minimum
                            number of instances to launch.

                        Ipv6Addresses -> (list)
                            One or more IPv6 addresses to assign to  the  net-
                            work interface. You cannot specify this option and
                            the option to assign a number of IPv6 addresses in
                            the  same  request. You cannot specify this option
                            if you've specified a minimum number of  instances
                            to launch.

                            (structure)
                               Describes an IPv6 address.

                               Ipv6Address -> (string)
                                   The IPv6 address.

                        NetworkInterfaceId -> (string)
                            The ID of the network interface.

                            If you are creating a Spot Fleet, omit this param-
                            eter because you cant specify a network  interface
                            ID in a launch specification.

                        PrivateIpAddress -> (string)
                            The private IPv4 address of the network interface.
                            Applies only if creating a network interface  when
                            launching  an  instance.  You  cannot specify this
                            option if you're launching more than one  instance
                            in a RunInstances request.

                        PrivateIpAddresses -> (list)
                            One  or  more  private IPv4 addresses to assign to
                            the  network  interface.  Only  one  private  IPv4
                            address  can  be designated as primary. You cannot
                            specify this option if you're launching more  than
                            one instance in a RunInstances request.

                            (structure)
                               Describes  a secondary private IPv4 address for
                               a network interface.

                               Primary -> (boolean)
                                   Indicates whether the private IPv4  address
                                   is  the  primary private IPv4 address. Only
