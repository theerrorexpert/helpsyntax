REVOKE-SECURITY-GROUP-EGRESS()                  REVOKE-SECURITY-GROUP-EGRESS()



NAME
       revoke-security-group-egress -

DESCRIPTION
       [VPC  only]  Removes the specified outbound (egress) rules from a secu-
       rity group for EC2-VPC. This action does not apply to  security  groups
       for use in EC2-Classic.

       You  can  specify  rules  using  either rule IDs or security group rule
       properties. If you use rule properties, the  values  that  you  specify
       (for  example,  ports)  must  match the existing rule's values exactly.
       Each rule has a protocol, from and  to  ports,  and  destination  (CIDR
       range,  security group, or prefix list). For the TCP and UDP protocols,
       you must also specify the destination port or range of ports.  For  the
       ICMP  protocol,  you  must  also specify the ICMP type and code. If the
       security group rule has a description, you do not need to  specify  the
       description to revoke the rule.

       [Default  VPC]  If  the  values  you  specify do not match the existing
       rule's values, no error is returned, and the output describes the secu-
       rity group rules that were not revoked.

       Amazon  Web Services recommends that you describe the security group to
       verify that the rules were removed.

       Rule changes are propagated to instances within the security  group  as
       quickly as possible. However, a small delay might occur.

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --group-id (string)
          The ID of the security group.

       --ip-permissions (list)
          The sets of IP permissions. You can't specify a destination security
          group and a CIDR IP address range in the same set of permissions.

          (structure)
              Describes a set of permissions for a security group rule.

              FromPort -> (integer)
                 The  start of port range for the TCP and UDP protocols, or an
                 ICMP/ICMPv6  type  number.  A  value  of  -1  indicates   all
                 ICMP/ICMPv6  types. If you specify all ICMP/ICMPv6 types, you
                 must specify all codes.

              IpProtocol -> (string)
                 The IP protocol name (tcp , udp , icmp , icmpv6 )  or  number
                 (see Protocol Numbers ).

                 [VPC  only] Use -1 to specify all protocols. When authorizing
                 security group rules, specifying  -1  or  a  protocol  number
                 other than tcp , udp , icmp , or icmpv6 allows traffic on all
                 ports, regardless of any port range you specify.  For  tcp  ,
                 udp  , and icmp , you must specify a port range. For icmpv6 ,
                 the port range is optional; if you omit the port range, traf-
                 fic for all types and codes is allowed.

              IpRanges -> (list)
                 The IPv4 ranges.

       --security-group-rule-ids (list)
          The IDs of the security group rules.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --protocol (string)
          The IP protocol: tcp | udp | icmp

          (VPC only) Use all to specify all protocols.

          If this argument is provided without also providing the  port  argu-
          ment,  then it will be applied to all ports for the specified proto-
          col.

       --port (string)
          For TCP or UDP: The range of ports to allow. A single integer  or  a
          range (min-max ).

          For  ICMP: A single integer or a range (type-code ) representing the
          ICMP type number and the ICMP code number respectively. A  value  of
          -1  indicates  all ICMP codes for all ICMP types. A value of -1 just
          for type indicates all ICMP codes for the specified ICMP type.

       --cidr (string)
          The CIDR IP range.

       --source-group (string)
          The name or ID of the source security group.

       --group-owner (string)
          The AWS account ID that owns the source security  group.  Cannot  be
          used when specifying a CIDR IP address.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example  1:  To  remove the rule that allows outbound traffic to a spe-
       cific address range

       The following revoke-security-group-egress example command removes  the
       rule that grants access to the specified address ranges on TCP port 80.

          aws ec2 revoke-security-group-egress \
              --group-id sg-026c12253ce15eff7 \
              --ip-permissions [{IpProtocol=tcp,FromPort=80,ToPort=80,IpRanges=[{CidrIp=10.0.0.0/16}]

       This command produces no output.

       For more information, see Security groups in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

       Example  2:  To  remove the rule that allows outbound traffic to a spe-
       cific security group

       rule that grants access to the specified security group on TCP port 80.

          aws ec2 revoke-security-group-egress \
              --group-id sg-026c12253ce15eff7 \
