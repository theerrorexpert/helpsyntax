NAME
       describe-spot-fleet-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the running instances for the specified Spot Fleet.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-spot-fleet-instances  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: ActiveInstances

SYNOPSIS
            describe-spot-fleet-instances
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          --spot-fleet-request-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --spot-fleet-request-id (string)
          The ID of the Spot Fleet request.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe the Spot Instances associated with a Spot fleet

       This example command lists the Spot instances associated with the spec-
       ified Spot fleet.

       Command:

          aws ec2 describe-spot-fleet-instances --spot-fleet-request-id sfr-73fbd2ce-aa30-494c-8788-1cee4EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
            "ActiveInstances": [
                {
                    "InstanceId": "i-1234567890abcdef0",
                    "InstanceType": "m3.medium",
                    "SpotInstanceRequestId": "sir-08b93456"
                },
                ...
            ],
            "SpotFleetRequestId": "sfr-73fbd2ce-aa30-494c-8788-1cee4EXAMPLE"
          }

OUTPUT
       ActiveInstances -> (list)
          The running instances. This list is refreshed periodically and might
          be out of date.

          (structure)
              Describes a running instance in a Spot Fleet.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the instance.

              InstanceType -> (string)
                 The instance type.

              SpotInstanceRequestId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Spot Instance request.

              InstanceHealth -> (string)
                 The health status of the instance. If the  status  of  either
                 the  instance  status  check  or  the  system status check is
                 impaired , the health status of the instance is  unhealthy  .
                 Otherwise, the health status is healthy .

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token  required to retrieve the next set of results. This value
          is null when there are no more results to return.

       SpotFleetRequestId -> (string)
          The ID of the Spot Fleet request.
