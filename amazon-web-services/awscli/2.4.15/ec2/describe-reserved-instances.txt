OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          One or more filters.

          o availability-zone -  The  Availability  Zone  where  the  Reserved
            Instance can be used.

          o duration  -  The  duration  of  the Reserved Instance (one year or
            three years), in seconds (31536000 | 94608000 ).

          o end - The time when the Reserved Instance  expires  (for  example,
            2015-08-07T11:54:42.000Z).

          o fixed-price  -  The  purchase  price of the Reserved Instance (for
            example, 9800.0).

          o instance-type - The instance type that is covered by the  reserva-
            tion.

            Zone ).

          o product-description  -  The  Reserved  Instance  product  platform
            description.  Instances  that  include (Amazon VPC) in the product
            platform description will only be displayed to EC2-Classic account
            holders  and  are for use with Amazon VPC (Linux/UNIX | Linux/UNIX
            (Amazon VPC) | SUSE Linux | SUSE Linux  (Amazon  VPC)  |  Red  Hat
            Enterprise Linux | Red Hat Enterprise Linux (Amazon VPC) | Red Hat
            Enterprise Linux with HA (Amazon VPC) | Windows | Windows  (Amazon
            VPC)  | Windows with SQL Server Standard | Windows with SQL Server
            Standard (Amazon VPC) | Windows with SQL Server Web | Windows with
            SQL Server Web (Amazon VPC) | Windows with SQL Server Enterprise |
            Windows with SQL Server Enterprise (Amazon VPC) ).

          o reserved-instances-id - The ID of the Reserved Instance.

          o start - The time at which the Reserved Instance  purchase  request
            was placed (for example, 2014-08-07T11:54:42.000Z).

          o state  -  The  state  of  the Reserved Instance (payment-pending |
            active | payment-failed | retired ).

          o tag:<key> - The key/value combination of a  tag  assigned  to  the
            resource.  Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as
            the filter value. For example, to find all resources that  have  a
            tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA , specify tag:Owner for
            the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

          o tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this fil-
            ter  to  find  all  resources  assigned a tag with a specific key,
            regardless of the tag value.

          o usage-price - The usage price of the Reserved Instance,  per  hour
            (for example, 0.84).

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --offering-class (string)
          Describes  whether the Reserved Instance is Standard or Convertible.

          Possible values:

          o standard

          o convertible

       --reserved-instances-ids (list)
          One or more Reserved Instance IDs.

          Default: Describes all your Reserved Instances, or only those other-
          wise specified.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --offering-type (string)
          The Reserved Instance offering type. If you  are  using  tools  that
          predate  the  2011-11-01  API  version,  you only have access to the
          Medium Utilization Reserved Instance offering type.

          Possible values:

          o Heavy Utilization

          o Medium Utilization

          o Light Utilization

          o No Upfront

          o Partial Upfront

          o All Upfront

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
