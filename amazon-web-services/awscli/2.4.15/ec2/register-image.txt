REGISTER-IMAGE()                                              REGISTER-IMAGE()



NAME
       register-image -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers  an  AMI. When you're creating an AMI, this is the final step
       you must complete before you can launch an instance from the  AMI.  For
       more information about creating AMIs, see Creating your own AMIs in the
       Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

       NOTE:
          For Amazon EBS-backed instances,  CreateImage creates and  registers
          the  AMI  in a single request, so you don't have to register the AMI
          yourself.

       If needed, you can deregister an AMI at any time. Any modifications you
       make  to an AMI backed by an instance store volume invalidates its reg-
       istration. If you make changes to an  image,  deregister  the  previous
       image and register the new image.
          Register a snapshot of a root device volume

       You can use RegisterImage to create an Amazon EBS-backed Linux AMI from
       a snapshot of a root device volume. You specify the  snapshot  using  a
       block  device mapping. You can't set the encryption state of the volume
       using the block device  mapping.  If  the  snapshot  is  encrypted,  or
       encryption  by  default  is  enabled,  the  root  volume of an instance
       launched from the AMI is encrypted.

       For more information, see Create a Linux AMI from a  snapshot  and  Use
       encryption  with  Amazon  EBS-backed AMIs in the Amazon Elastic Compute
       Cloud User Guide .
          Amazon Web Services Marketplace product codes

       If any snapshots have Amazon Web Services  Marketplace  product  codes,
       they are copied to the new AMI.

       Windows  and some Linux distributions, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux
       (RHEL) and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server  (SLES),  use  the  Amazon  EC2
       billing  product code associated with an AMI to verify the subscription
       status for package updates. To create a new AMI for  operating  systems
       that require a billing product code, instead of registering the AMI, do
       the following to preserve the billing product code association:

       o Launch an instance from an existing AMI  with  that  billing  product
         code.

       o Customize the instance.

       o Create an AMI from the instance using  CreateImage .

       If  you  purchase a Reserved Instance to apply to an On-Demand Instance
       that was launched from an AMI with a billing product  code,  make  sure
       that  the  Reserved  Instance has the matching billing product code. If
       you purchase a Reserved Instance without the matching  billing  product
       code,  the  Reserved  Instance  will  not  be  applied to the On-Demand
       Instance. For information about how to obtain the platform details  and
       billing  information  of  an  AMI, see Understanding AMI billing in the
       Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --image-location (string)
          The full path to your AMI manifest in Amazon S3 storage. The  speci-
          fied  bucket  must have the aws-exec-read canned access control list
          (ACL) to ensure that it can be accessed  by  Amazon  EC2.  For  more
          information,  see  Canned  ACLs  in  the Amazon S3 Service Developer
          Guide .

       --architecture (string)
          The architecture of the AMI.

          Default:  For  Amazon  EBS-backed  AMIs,   i386   .   For   instance
          store-backed  AMIs, the architecture specified in the manifest file.

          Possible values:

          o i386

          o x86_64

          o arm64

          o x86_64_mac

       --block-device-mappings (list)
          The block device mapping entries.

          If you specify an Amazon EBS volume using the ID of  an  Amazon  EBS
          snapshot, you can't specify the encryption state of the volume.

          If  you create an AMI on an Outpost, then all backing snapshots must
          be on the same Outpost or in the Region of that Outpost. AMIs on  an
          Outpost that include local snapshots can be used to launch instances
          on the same Outpost only. For more  information,  Amazon  EBS  local
          snapshots on Outposts in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide
          .

          (structure)
              Describes a block device mapping, which defines the EBS  volumes
              and instance store volumes to attach to an instance at launch.

              DeviceName -> (string)
                 The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh ).

              VirtualName -> (string)
                 The virtual device name (ephemeral N). Instance store volumes
                 are numbered starting from 0. An instance type with 2  avail-
                 able   instance   store  volumes  can  specify  mappings  for
                 ephemeral0 and ephemeral1 . The number of available  instance
                 store volumes depends on the instance type. After you connect
                 to the instance, you must mount the volume.

                 NVMe instance store volumes are automatically enumerated  and
                 assigned  a  device name. Including them in your block device
                 mapping has no effect.

                 Constraints: For M3  instances,  you  must  specify  instance
                 store  volumes  in the block device mapping for the instance.
                 When you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance  store
                 volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI.

              Ebs -> (structure)
                 Parameters  used to automatically set up EBS volumes when the
                 instance is launched.

                 DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted  on  instance
                     termination.  For more information, see Preserving Amazon
                     EBS volumes on instance termination  in  the  Amazon  EC2
                     User Guide .

                 Iops -> (integer)
                     The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For gp3 ,
                     io1 , and io2 volumes, this represents the number of IOPS
                     that  are  provisioned  for  the volume. For gp2 volumes,
                     this represents the baseline performance  of  the  volume
                     and  the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits
                     for bursting.

                     The following are the supported values  for  each  volume
                     type:

                     o gp3 : 3,000-16,000 IOPS

                     o io1 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                     o io2 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                     For  io1  and  io2 volumes, we guarantee 64,000 IOPS only
                     for Instances built on the Nitro System . Other  instance
                     families guarantee performance up to 32,000 IOPS.

                     This  parameter  is required for io1 and io2 volumes. The
                     default for gp3 volumes is 3,000 IOPS. This parameter  is
                     not  supported for gp2 , st1 , sc1 , or standard volumes.

                 SnapshotId -> (string)
                     The ID of the snapshot.

                 VolumeSize -> (integer)
                     The size of the volume, in GiBs. You must specify  either
                     a  snapshot  ID  or a volume size. If you specify a snap-
                     shot, the default is the snapshot size. You can specify a
                     volume  size that is equal to or larger than the snapshot
                     size.

                     The following are the supported volumes  sizes  for  each
                     volume type:

                     o gp2 and gp3 :1-16,384

                     o io1 and io2 : 4-16,384

                     o st1 and sc1 : 125-16,384

                     o standard : 1-1,024

                 VolumeType -> (string)
                     The  volume  type.  For  more information, see Amazon EBS
                     volume types in the Amazon EC2 User Guide . If the volume
                     type  is  io1 or io2 , you must specify the IOPS that the
                     volume supports.

                 KmsKeyId -> (string)
                     Identifier (key ID, key alias, ID ARN, or alias ARN)  for
                     a  customer  managed  CMK  under  which the EBS volume is
                     encrypted.

                     This parameter is only  supported  on  BlockDeviceMapping
                     objects  called  by RunInstances , RequestSpotFleet , and
                     RequestSpotInstances .

                 Throughput -> (integer)
                     The throughput that the volume supports, in MiB/s.

                     This parameter is valid only for gp3 volumes.

                     Valid Range: Minimum value of 125. Maximum value of 1000.

                 OutpostArn -> (string)
                     The ARN of the Outpost on which the snapshot is stored.

                 Encrypted -> (boolean)
                     Indicates  whether  the encryption state of an EBS volume
                     is changed while being restored from a backing  snapshot.
                     The  effect  of  setting  the  encryption  state  to true
                     depends on the volume origin (new or  from  a  snapshot),
                     starting encryption state, ownership, and whether encryp-
                     tion by default is enabled.  For  more  information,  see
                     Amazon EBS encryption in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

                     In  no  case  can you remove encryption from an encrypted
                     volume.

                     Encrypted volumes can only be attached to instances  that
                     support  Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see
                     Supported instance types .

                     This parameter is not returned by .

              NoDevice -> (string)
                 To omit the device from the block device mapping, specify  an
                 empty  string. When this property is specified, the device is
                 removed from the  block  device  mapping  regardless  of  the
                 assigned value.

            }
            ...
          ]

       --description (string)
          A description for your AMI.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --ena-support | --no-ena-support (boolean)
          Set to true to enable enhanced networking with ENA for the  AMI  and
          any instances that you launch from the AMI.

          This  option  is supported only for HVM AMIs. Specifying this option
          with a PV AMI can make instances launched from the AMI  unreachable.

       --kernel-id (string)
          The ID of the kernel.

       --name (string)
          A name for your AMI.

          Constraints: 3-128 alphanumeric characters, parentheses (()), square
          brackets ([]), spaces ( ), periods (.),  slashes  (/),  dashes  (-),
          single quotes ('), at-signs (@), or underscores(_)

       --billing-products (list)
          The  billing product codes. Your account must be authorized to spec-
          ify billing product codes. Otherwise, you can  use  the  Amazon  Web
          Services Marketplace to bill for the use of an AMI.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --ramdisk-id (string)
          The ID of the RAM disk.

       --root-device-name (string)
          The device name of the root device volume (for example, /dev/sda1 ).

       --sriov-net-support (string)
          Set to simple to enable enhanced networking  with  the  Intel  82599
          Virtual  Function  interface  for the AMI and any instances that you
          launch from the AMI.

          There is no way to disable sriovNetSupport at this time.

          This option is supported only for HVM AMIs. Specifying  this  option
          with  a PV AMI can make instances launched from the AMI unreachable.

       --virtualization-type (string)
          The type of virtualization (hvm | paravirtual ).

          Default: paravirtual

       --boot-mode (string)
          The boot mode of the AMI. For more information, see  Boot  modes  in
          the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o legacy-bios

          o uefi

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To register an AMI using a manifest file

       The  following register-image example registers an AMI using the speci-
       fied manifest file in Amazon S3.

          aws ec2 register-image \
              --name my-image \
              --image-location my-s3-bucket/myimage/image.manifest.xml

       Output:

          {
              "ImageId": "ami-1234567890EXAMPLE"
          }

       For more information, see Amazon Machine Images (AMI) in the Amazon EC2
       User Guide.

       Example 2: To register an AMI using a snapshot of a root device

       The  following register-image example registers an AMI using the speci-
       fied snapshot of an EBS root volume  as  device  /dev/xvda.  The  block
       device  mapping  also  includes  an  empty 100 GiB EBS volume as device
       /dev/xvdf.

          aws ec2 register-image \
              --name my-image \
              --root-device-name /dev/xvda \
