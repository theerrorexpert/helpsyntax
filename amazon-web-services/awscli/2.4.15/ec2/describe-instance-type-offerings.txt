NAME
       describe-instance-type-offerings -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of all instance types offered. The results can be fil-
       tered by location (Region or Availability  Zone).  If  no  location  is
       specified,  the  instance  types  offered  in  the  current  Region are
       returned.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-instance-type-offerings is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: InstanceTypeOfferings

SYNOPSIS
            describe-instance-type-offerings
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--location-type <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --location-type (string)
          The location type.

          Possible values:

          o region

          o availability-zone

          o availability-zone-id

       --filters (list)
          One or more filters. Filter names and values are case-sensitive.

          o location - This depends on the location type. For example, if  the
            location type is region (default), the location is the Region code
            (for example, us-east-2 .)

          o instance-type - The instance type. For example, c5.2xlarge .

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To list the instance types offered in a Region

       The   following   describe-instance-type-offerings  example  lists  the
       instance types offered in the Region configured as the  default  Region
       for the AWS CLI.

          aws ec2 describe-instance-type-offerings

       To  list  the instance types offered in a different Region, specify the
       Region using the --region parameter.

          aws ec2 describe-instance-type-offerings \
              --region us-east-2

       Output:

          {
            "InstanceTypeOfferings": [
                {
                    "InstanceType": "m5.2xlarge",
                    "LocationType": "region",
                    "Location": "us-east-2"
                },
                {
                    "InstanceType": "t3.micro",
                    "LocationType": "region",
                    "Location": "us-east-2"
                },
                ...
            ]
          }

       Example 2: To list the instance types offered in an Availability Zone

       The  following  describe-instance-type-offerings  example   lists   the
       instance  types  offered in the specified Availability Zone. The Avail-
       ability Zone must be in the specified Region.

          aws ec2 describe-instance-type-offerings \
              --location-type availability-zone \
              --filters Name=location,Values=us-east-2a \
              --region us-east-2

       Example 3: To check whether an instance type is supported

       The  following   describe-instance-type-offerings   command   indicates
       whether  the  c5.xlarge  instance  type  is  supported in the specified
       Region.

          aws ec2 describe-instance-type-offerings \
              --filters Name=instance-type,Values=c5.xlarge \
              --region us-east-2

       The following describe-instance-type-offerings  example  lists  all  C5
       instance types that are supported in the specified Region.

          aws ec2 describe-instance-type-offerings \
              --filters Name=instance-type,Values=c5* \
              --query "InstanceTypeOfferings[].InstanceType" \
              --region us-east-2

       Output:

          [
              "c5d.12xlarge",
              "c5d.9xlarge",
              "c5n.xlarge",
              "c5.xlarge",
              "c5d.metal",
              "c5n.metal",
              "c5.large",
              "c5d.2xlarge",
              "c5n.4xlarge",
              "c5.2xlarge",
              "c5n.large",
              "c5n.9xlarge",
              "c5d.large",
              "c5.18xlarge",
              "c5d.18xlarge",
              "c5.12xlarge",
              "c5n.18xlarge",
              "c5.metal",
              "c5d.4xlarge",
              "c5.24xlarge",
              "c5d.xlarge",
              "c5n.2xlarge",
              "c5d.24xlarge",
              "c5.9xlarge",
              "c5.4xlarge"
          ]

OUTPUT
       InstanceTypeOfferings -> (list)
          The instance types offered.

          (structure)
              The instance types offered.

              InstanceType -> (string)
                 The  instance  type. For more information, see Instance types
                 in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

              LocationType -> (string)
                 The location type.

              Location -> (string)
                 The identifier for the location. This depends on the location
                 type. For example, if the location type is region , the loca-
                 tion is the Region code (for example, us-east-2 .)

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is
          null when there are no more results to return.
