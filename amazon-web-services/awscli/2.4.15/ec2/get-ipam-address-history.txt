GET-IPAM-ADDRESS-HISTORY()                          GET-IPAM-ADDRESS-HISTORY()



NAME
       get-ipam-address-history -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieve  historical information about a CIDR within an IPAM scope. For
       more information, see View the history of IP addresses  in  the  Amazon
       VPC IPAM User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-ipam-address-history  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: HistoryRecords

SYNOPSIS
            get-ipam-address-history
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          --cidr <value>
          --ipam-scope-id <value>
          [--vpc-id <value>]
          [--start-time <value>]
          [--end-time <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without  actually making the request and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cidr (string)
          The CIDR you want the history of. The CIDR can be an IPv4 or IPv6 IP
          address range. If you enter a /16 IPv4 CIDR, you  will  get  records
          that  match  it  exactly.  You  will not get records for any subnets
          within the /16 CIDR.

       --ipam-scope-id (string)
          The ID of the IPAM scope that the CIDR is in.

       --vpc-id (string)
          The ID of the VPC you want your history records filtered by.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The start of the time period for which you are looking for  history.
          If you omit this option, it will default to the value of EndTime.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end of the time period for which you are looking for history. If
          you omit this option, it will default to the current time.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the history of a CIDR

       The  following  get-ipam-address-history  example gets the history of a
       CIDR.

       (Linux):

          aws ec2 get-ipam-address-history \
             --cidr 10.0.0.0/16 \
             --ipam-scope-id ipam-scope-02fc38cd4c48e7d38 \
             --start-time 2021-12-08T01:00:00.000Z \
             --end-time 2021-12-10T01:00:00.000Z

       (Windows):

          aws ec2 get-ipam-address-history ^
             --cidr 10.0.0.0/16 ^
             --ipam-scope-id ipam-scope-02fc38cd4c48e7d38 ^
             --start-time 2021-12-08T01:00:00.000Z ^
             --end-time 2021-12-10T01:00:00.000Z

OUTPUT
       HistoryRecords -> (list)
          A  historical record for a CIDR within an IPAM scope. If the CIDR is
          associated with an EC2 instance, you  will  see  an  object  in  the
          response for the instance and one for the network interface.

          (structure)
              The  historical  record of a CIDR within an IPAM scope. For more
              information, see View the history of IP addresses in the  Amazon
              VPC IPAM User Guide .

              ResourceOwnerId -> (string)
                 The ID of the resource owner.

              ResourceRegion -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services Region of the resource.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of the resource.

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the resource.

              ResourceCidr -> (string)
                 The CIDR of the resource.

              ResourceName -> (string)
                 The name of the resource.

              ResourceComplianceStatus -> (string)
                 The  compliance status of a resource. For more information on
                 compliance statuses, see Monitor CIDR usage  by  resource  in
                 the Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide .

              ResourceOverlapStatus -> (string)
                 The  overlap  status  of an IPAM resource. The overlap status
                 tells you if the CIDR for a resource  overlaps  with  another
                 CIDR  in the scope. For more information on overlap statuses,
                 see Monitor CIDR usage by resource in  the  Amazon  VPC  IPAM
                 User Guide .

              VpcId -> (string)
                 The VPC ID of the resource.

              SampledStartTime -> (timestamp)
                 Sampled start time of the resource-to-CIDR association within
                 the IPAM scope. Changes are picked up in periodic  snapshots,
                 so  the  start  time  may  have occurred before this specific
                 time.

              SampledEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 Sampled end time of the resource-to-CIDR  association  within
                 the  IPAM scope. Changes are picked up in periodic snapshots,
                 so the end time may have occurred before this specific  time.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is
          null when there are no more results to return.
