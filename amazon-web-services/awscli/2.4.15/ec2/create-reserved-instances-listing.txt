NAME
       create-reserved-instances-listing -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a listing for Amazon EC2 Standard Reserved Instances to be sold
       in the Reserved Instance  Marketplace.  You  can  submit  one  Standard
       Reserved  Instance  listing  at  a time. To get a list of your Standard
       Reserved Instances, you can use the   DescribeReservedInstances  opera-
       tion.

       NOTE:
          Only  Standard  Reserved  Instances  can  be  sold  in  the Reserved
          Instance Marketplace. Convertible Reserved Instances cannot be sold.

       The  Reserved  Instance  Marketplace matches sellers who want to resell
       Standard Reserved Instance capacity that they no longer need with  buy-
       ers who want to purchase additional capacity. Reserved Instances bought
       and sold through the Reserved Instance Marketplace work like any  other
       Reserved Instances.

       To  sell your Standard Reserved Instances, you must first register as a
       seller in the Reserved Instance Marketplace. After completing the  reg-
       istration process, you can create a Reserved Instance Marketplace list-
       ing of some or all of your Standard Reserved Instances, and specify the
       upfront  price  to  receive  for  them. Your Standard Reserved Instance
       listings then become available for purchase. To  view  the  details  of
       your  Standard  Reserved Instance listing, you can use the  DescribeRe-
       servedInstancesListings operation.

       For more information, see Reserved Instance Marketplace in  the  Amazon
       EC2 User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            create-reserved-instances-listing
          --client-token <value>
          --instance-count <value>
          --price-schedules <value>
          --reserved-instances-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive identifier you provide to ensure idempotency
          of your listings. This helps  avoid  duplicate  listings.  For  more
          information, see Ensuring Idempotency .

       --instance-count (integer)
          The  number  of  instances  that  are  a part of a Reserved Instance
          account to be listed in the Reserved Instance Marketplace. This num-
          ber  should  be  less than or equal to the instance count associated
          with the Reserved Instance ID specified in this call.

       --price-schedules (list)
          A list specifying the price of the Standard  Reserved  Instance  for
          each month remaining in the Reserved Instance term.

          (structure)
              Describes the price for a Reserved Instance.

              CurrencyCode -> (string)
                 The currency for transacting the Reserved Instance resale. At
                 this time, the only supported currency is USD .

              Price -> (double)
                 The fixed price for the term.

              Term -> (long)
                 The number of months remaining in the reservation. For  exam-
                 ple,  2  is  the second to the last month before the capacity
                 reservation expires.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CurrencyCode=string,Price=double,Term=long ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "CurrencyCode": "USD",
              "Price": double,
              "Term": long
            }
            ...
          ]

       --reserved-instances-id (string)
          The ID of the active Standard Reserved Instance.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              CreateDate -> (timestamp)

                        The number of listed Reserved Instances in  the  state
                        specified by the state .

                     State -> (string)
                        The states of the listed Reserved Instances.

              PriceSchedules -> (list)
                 The price of the Reserved Instance listing.

                 (structure)
                     Describes the price for a Reserved Instance.

                     Active -> (boolean)

                        remaining for the Reserved Instance in the listing.

                        A specific price schedule is  always  in  effect,  but
                        only  one  price  schedule  can be active at any time.
                        Take, for example, a Reserved  Instance  listing  that
                        has  five months remaining in its term. When you spec-
                        ify price schedules for five months  and  two  months,
                        this  means  that schedule 1, covering the first three
                        months of the remaining term, will  be  active  during
                        months 5, 4, and 3. Then schedule 2, covering the last
                        two months of the term, will be active  for  months  2
                        and 1.

                     Key -> (string)
