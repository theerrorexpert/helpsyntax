CREATE-CUSTOMER-GATEWAY()                            CREATE-CUSTOMER-GATEWAY()



NAME
       create-customer-gateway -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  information  to  Amazon  Web Services about your VPN customer
       gateway device. The customer gateway is the appliance at  your  end  of
       the  VPN connection. (The device on the Amazon Web Services side of the
       VPN connection is the virtual private gateway.) You  must  provide  the
       internet-routable  IP address of the customer gateway's external inter-
       face. The IP address must be static and can be behind a device perform-
       ing network address translation (NAT).

       For  devices  that use Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), you can also pro-
       vide the device's BGP Autonomous System Number (ASN). You  can  use  an
       existing  ASN  assigned  to  your  network.  If  you  don't have an ASN
       already, you can use a private ASN (in the 64512 - 65534 range).

       NOTE:
          Amazon EC2 supports all 4-byte ASN numbers  in  the  range  of  1  -
          2147483647, with the exception of the following:

          o 7224 - reserved in the us-east-1 Region

          o 9059 - reserved in the eu-west-1 Region

          o 17943 - reserved in the ap-southeast-1 Region

          o 10124 - reserved in the ap-northeast-1 Region

       For  more  information, see Amazon Web Services Site-to-Site VPN in the
       Amazon Web Services Site-to-Site VPN User Guide .

       WARNING:
          To create more than one customer gateway with the same VPN type,  IP
          address, and BGP ASN, specify a unique device name for each customer
          gateway. Identical requests return information  about  the  existing
          customer gateway and do not create new customer gateways.

                }
                ...
              ]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --device-name (string)
          A name for the customer gateway device.

          Length Constraints: Up to 255 characters.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.
