DESCRIBE-ADDRESSES-ATTRIBUTE()                  DESCRIBE-ADDRESSES-ATTRIBUTE()



NAME
       describe-addresses-attribute -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  attributes  of  the specified Elastic IP addresses. For
       requirements, see Using reverse DNS for email applications .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-addresses-attribute is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: Addresses

SYNOPSIS
            describe-addresses-attribute
          [--allocation-ids <value>]
          [--attribute <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --allocation-ids (list)
          [EC2-VPC] The allocation IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --attribute (string)
          The attribute of the IP address.

          Possible values:

          o domain-name

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To view the attributes of the domain name associated with an elastic IP
       address

       The  following   describe-addresses-attribute   examples   return   the
       attributes of the domain name associated with the elastic IP address.

       Linux:

          aws ec2 describe-addresses-attribute \
              --allocation-ids eipalloc-abcdef01234567890 \
              --attribute domain-name

       Windows:

          aws ec2 describe-addresses-attribute ^
              --allocation-ids eipalloc-abcdef01234567890 ^
              --attribute domain-name

       Output:

          {
              "Addresses": [
                  {
                      "PublicIp": "192.0.2.0",
                      "AllocationId": "eipalloc-abcdef01234567890",
                      "PtrRecord": "example.com."
                  }
              ]
          }

       To  view  the  attributes of an elastic IP address, you must have first
       associated a domain name with the elastic IP address. For more informa-
       tion, see Use reverse DNS for email applications in the Amazon EC2 User
       Guide or modify-address-attribute in the AWS CLI Command Reference.

              AllocationId -> (string)

              PtrRecord -> (string)
                 The pointer (PTR) record for the IP address.

              PtrRecordUpdate -> (structure)
