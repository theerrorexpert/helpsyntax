ASSOCIATE-ENCLAVE-CERTIFICATE-IAM-ROLEASSOCIATE-ENCLAVE-CERTIFICATE-IAM-ROLE()



NAME
       associate-enclave-certificate-iam-role -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  an  Identity  and Access Management (IAM) role with an Cer-
       tificate Manager (ACM) certificate. This enables the certificate to  be
       used  by  the ACM for Nitro Enclaves application inside an enclave. For
       more information, see Certificate Manager for  Nitro  Enclaves  in  the
       Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves User Guide .

       When  the IAM role is associated with the ACM certificate, the certifi-
       cate, certificate chain, and encrypted private key  are  placed  in  an
       Amazon S3 bucket that only the associated IAM role can access. The pri-
       vate key of the certificate is encrypted with an  Amazon  Web  Services
       managed key that has an attached attestation-based key policy.

       To  enable  the IAM role to access the Amazon S3 object, you must grant
       it permission to call s3:GetObject on the Amazon S3 bucket returned  by
       the  command.  To  enable  the IAM role to access the KMS key, you must
       grant it permission to call kms:Decrypt on the KMS key returned by  the
       command.  For more information, see Grant the role permission to access
       the certificate and encryption key in the  Amazon  Web  Services  Nitro
       Enclaves User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            associate-enclave-certificate-iam-role
          [--certificate-arn <value>]
          [--role-arn <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-arn (string)
          The ARN of the ACM certificate with which to associate the IAM role.

       --role-arn (string)
          The ARN of the IAM role to associate with the ACM  certificate.  You
          can associate up to 16 IAM roles with an ACM certificate.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CertificateS3BucketName -> (string)
          The name of the Amazon  S3  bucket  to  which  the  certificate  was
          uploaded.

       CertificateS3ObjectKey -> (string)
          The  Amazon  S3 object key where the certificate, certificate chain,
          and encrypted private key bundle are stored. The object key is  for-
          matted as follows: role_arn /certificate_arn .

       EncryptionKmsKeyId -> (string)
          The  ID  of  the KMS key used to encrypt the private key of the cer-
          tificate.
