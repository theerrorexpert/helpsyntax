NAME
       run-scheduled-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Launches the specified Scheduled Instances.

       Before  you  can  launch a Scheduled Instance, you must purchase it and
       obtain an identifier using  PurchaseScheduledInstances .

       You must launch a Scheduled Instance during its scheduled time  period.
       You can't stop or reboot a Scheduled Instance, but you can terminate it
       as needed. If you terminate a Scheduled  Instance  before  the  current
       scheduled  time  period  ends, you can launch it again after a few min-
       utes. For more information, see Scheduled Instances in the  Amazon  EC2
       User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive  identifier  that ensures the idempotency of
          the request. For more information, see Ensuring Idempotency .

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --instance-count (integer)
          The number of instances.

          Default: 1

       --launch-specification (structure)
          The  launch  specification. You must match the instance type, Avail-
          ability Zone, network, and platform of the schedule  that  you  pur-
          chased.

          BlockDeviceMappings -> (list)
              The block device mapping entries.

              (structure)

                 DeviceName -> (string)
                     The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh ).

                 Ebs -> (structure)
                     Parameters  used to set up EBS volumes automatically when
                     the instance is launched.

                     DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                        Indicates whether the volume is  deleted  on  instance
                        termination.

                     Encrypted -> (boolean)
                        Indicates  whether  the  volume  is encrypted. You can
                        attached encrypted volumes only to instances that sup-
                        port them.

                     Iops -> (integer)
                        The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS) to pro-
                        vision for an io1 or io2 volume, with a maximum  ratio
                        of  50  IOPS/GiB  for io1 , and 500 IOPS/GiB for io2 .
                        Range is 100  to  64,000  IOPS  for  volumes  in  most
                        Regions.  Maximum IOPS of 64,000 is guaranteed only on
                        instances built on the Nitro System .  Other  instance
                        families  guarantee performance up to 32,000 IOPS. For
                        more information, see Amazon EBS volume types  in  the
                        Amazon EC2 User Guide .

                        This  parameter is valid only for Provisioned IOPS SSD

                        Default: If you're creating the volume from a snapshot
                        and  don't  specify  a volume size, the default is the
                        snapshot size.

                     VolumeType -> (string)
                        The volume type. gp2 for General Purpose SSD,  io1  or
                        io2 for Provisioned IOPS SSD, Throughput Optimized HDD
                        for st1 , Cold HDD for sc1 , or standard for Magnetic.

                        Default: gp2

                 NoDevice -> (string)
                     To omit the device from the block device mapping, specify
                     an empty string.

                 VirtualName -> (string)
                     The virtual device name  (ephemeral  N).  Instance  store
                     volumes  are  numbered  starting from 0. An instance type
                     with two available instance  store  volumes  can  specify
                     mappings  for  ephemeral0  and ephemeral1 . The number of
                     available instance store volumes depends on the  instance
                     type.  After  you connect to the instance, you must mount
                     the volume.

                     Constraints: For M3 instances, you must specify  instance
                     store  volumes  in  the  block  device  mapping  for  the
                     instance. When you launch an M3 instance, we  ignore  any
                     instance store volumes specified in the block device map-
                     ping for the AMI.

          EbsOptimized -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether the instances are optimized for EBS I/O.  This
              optimization  provides dedicated throughput to Amazon EBS and an
              optimized configuration stack to provide optimal EBS I/O perfor-
              mance.  This  optimization  isn't  available  with  all instance
              types. Additional usage charges apply when  using  an  EBS-opti-
              mized instance.

              Default: false

                     Indicates  whether  to  assign  a  public IPv4 address to

       --scheduled-instance-id (string)
          The Scheduled Instance ID.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
