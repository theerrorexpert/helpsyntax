DESCRIBE-SNAPSHOTS()                                      DESCRIBE-SNAPSHOTS()



NAME
       describe-snapshots -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  specified  EBS snapshots available to you or all of the
       EBS snapshots available to you.

       The snapshots available to you include public snapshots, private  snap-
       shots  that  you  own,  and private snapshots owned by other Amazon Web
       Services accounts for which you have  explicit  create  volume  permis-
       sions.

       The create volume permissions fall into the following categories:

       o public  : The owner of the snapshot granted create volume permissions
         for the snapshot to the all group. All Amazon Web  Services  accounts
         have create volume permissions for these snapshots.

       o explicit  :  The  owner of the snapshot granted create volume permis-
         sions to a specific Amazon Web Services account.

       o implicit : An Amazon Web Services account has implicit create  volume
         permissions for all snapshots it owns.

       The  list  of snapshots returned can be filtered by specifying snapshot
       IDs, snapshot owners, or Amazon Web Services accounts with create  vol-
       ume  permissions.  If  no options are specified, Amazon EC2 returns all
       snapshots for which you have create volume permissions.

       If you specify one or more snapshot IDs, only snapshots that  have  the
       specified  IDs  are returned. If you specify an invalid snapshot ID, an
       error is returned. If you specify a snapshot ID for which  you  do  not
       have access, it is not included in the returned results.

       If  you  specify one or more snapshot owners using the OwnerIds option,
       only snapshots from the specified owners and for which you have  access
       are  returned.  The results can include the Amazon Web Services account
       IDs of the specified owners, amazon for snapshots owned by  Amazon,  or
       self for snapshots that you own.

       If  you  specify a list of restorable users, only snapshots with create
       snapshot permissions for those users are returned. You can specify Ama-
       zon Web Services account IDs (if you own the snapshots), self for snap-
       shots for which you own or have explicit permissions, or all for public
       snapshots.

       If  you  are describing a long list of snapshots, we recommend that you
       paginate the output to make the list more  manageable.  The  MaxResults
       parameter sets the maximum number of results returned in a single page.
       If the list of results exceeds your MaxResults value, then that  number
       of  results is returned along with a NextToken value that can be passed
       to a subsequent DescribeSnapshots request  to  retrieve  the  remaining
       results.

       To  get  the  state  of  fast  snapshot  restores  for  a snapshot, use
       DescribeFastSnapshotRestores .

       For more information about EBS snapshots, see Amazon EBS  snapshots  in
       the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-snapshots  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Snapshots

            describe-snapshots
          [--filters <value>]
          [--owner-ids <value>]
          [--restorable-by-user-ids <value>]
          [--snapshot-ids <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          The filters.

          o description - A description of the snapshot.

          o encrypted - Indicates whether the snapshot is  encrypted  (true  |
            false )

          o owner-alias  -  The  owner  alias,  from an Amazon-maintained list
            (amazon ). This is not the  user-configured  Amazon  Web  Services
            account alias set using the IAM console. We recommend that you use
            the related parameter instead of this filter.

          o owner-id - The Amazon Web Services account ID  of  the  owner.  We
            recommend  that you use the related parameter instead of this fil-
            ter.

          o progress - The progress of the  snapshot,  as  a  percentage  (for
            example, 80%).

          o snapshot-id - The snapshot ID.

          o start-time - The time stamp when the snapshot was initiated.

          o status  -  The status of the snapshot (pending | completed | error
            ).

          o storage-tier - The storage tier of the snapshot (archive  |  stan-
            dard ).

          o tag  :<key>  -  The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the
            resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value  as
            the  filter  value. For example, to find all resources that have a
            tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA , specify tag:Owner for
            the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

          o tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this fil-
            ter to find all resources assigned a  tag  with  a  specific  key,
            regardless of the tag value.

          o volume-id - The ID of the volume the snapshot is for.

          o volume-size - The size of the volume, in GiB.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --owner-ids (list)
          Scopes  the  results to snapshots with the specified owners. You can
          specify a combination of Amazon Web Services account IDs, self , and
          amazon .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --restorable-by-user-ids (list)
          The  IDs of the Amazon Web Services accounts that can create volumes
          from the snapshot.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --snapshot-ids (list)
          The snapshot IDs.

          Default: Describes the snapshots for which you  have  create  volume
          permissions.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To describe a snapshot

       The  following describe-snapshots example describes the specified snap-
       shot.

          aws ec2 describe-snapshots \
              --snapshot-ids snap-1234567890abcdef0

       Output:

          {
              "Snapshots": [
                  {
                      "Description": "This is my snapshot",
                      "Encrypted": false,
                      "VolumeId": "vol-049df61146c4d7901",
                      "State": "completed",
                      "VolumeSize": 8,
                      "StartTime": "2019-02-28T21:28:32.000Z",
                      "Progress": "100%",
                      "OwnerId": "012345678910",
                      "SnapshotId": "snap-01234567890abcdef",
                      "Tags": [
                          {
                              "Key": "Stack",
                              "Value": "test"
                          }
                      ]
                  }
              ]
          }

       For more information, see Amazon EBS snapshots in the Amazon  EC2  User
       Guide.

       Example 2: To describe snapshots based on filters

       The  following  describe-snapshots  example  uses  filters to scope the
       results to snapshots owned by your AWS account that are in the  pending
       state. The example uses the --query parameter to display only the snap-
       shot IDs and the time the snapshot was started.

          aws ec2 describe-snapshots \
              --owner-ids self \
              --filters Name=status,Values=pending \
              --query "Snapshots[*].{ID:SnapshotId,Time:StartTime}"

       Output:

          [
              {
                  "ID": "snap-1234567890abcdef0",
                  "Time": "2019-08-04T12:48:18.000Z"
              },
              {
                  "ID": "snap-066877671789bd71b",
                  "Time": "2019-08-04T02:45:16.000Z
              },
              ...
          ]

       The following describe-snapshots example  uses  filters  to  scope  the
       results  to  snapshots  created  from the specified volume. The example
       uses the --query parameter to display only the snapshot IDs.

          aws ec2 describe-snapshots \
              --filters Name=volume-id,Values=049df61146c4d7901 \
              --query "Snapshots[*].[SnapshotId]" \
              --output text

       Output:

          snap-1234567890abcdef0
          snap-08637175a712c3fb9
          ...

       For additional examples using filters, see Listing and  filtering  your
       resources in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

       Example 3: To describe snapshots based on tags

       The  following describe-snapshots example uses tag filters to scope the
       results to snapshots that have the tag Stack=Prod.

          aws ec2 describe-snapshots \
              --filters Name=tag:Stack,Values=prod

       For an example of the output for describe-snapshots, see Example 1.

       For additional examples using tag filters, see Working with tags in the
       Amazon EC2 User Guide.

       Example 4: To describe snapshots based on age

       The  following  describe-snapshots example uses JMESPath expressions to
       describe all snapshots created by your AWS account before the specified
       date. It displays only the snapshot IDs.

          aws ec2 describe-snapshots \
              --owner-ids 012345678910 \
              --query "Snapshots[?(StartTime<='2020-03-31')].[SnapshotId]"

       For  additional  examples using filters, see Listing and filtering your
       resources in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

OUTPUT
       Snapshots -> (list)
          Information about the snapshots.

          (structure)
              Describes a snapshot.

              DataEncryptionKeyId -> (string)
                 The data encryption key identifier  for  the  snapshot.  This
                 value  is  a  unique  identifier that corresponds to the data
                 encryption key that was used to encrypt the  original  volume
                 or  snapshot copy. Because data encryption keys are inherited
                 by volumes created from snapshots, and vice versa,  if  snap-
                 shots  share  the  same  data encryption key identifier, then
                 they belong to the same volume/snapshot lineage. This parame-
                 ter is only returned by  DescribeSnapshots .

              Description -> (string)
                 The description for the snapshot.

              Encrypted -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the snapshot is encrypted.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Key Management Service
                 (KMS) KMS key that was used to protect the volume  encryption
                 key for the parent volume.

              OwnerId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the EBS
                 snapshot.

              Progress -> (string)
                 The progress of the snapshot, as a percentage.

              SnapshotId -> (string)
                 The ID of the snapshot. Each snapshot receives a unique iden-
                 tifier when it is created.

              StartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time stamp when the snapshot was initiated.

              State -> (string)
                 The snapshot state.

              StateMessage -> (string)
                 Encrypted  Amazon EBS snapshots are copied asynchronously. If
                 a snapshot copy operation fails (for example, if  the  proper
                 Key  Management  Service  (KMS) permissions are not obtained)
                 this field displays error state details to help you  diagnose
                 why  the  error  occurred. This parameter is only returned by
                 DescribeSnapshots .

              VolumeId -> (string)
                 The ID of the volume that was used to  create  the  snapshot.
                 Snapshots  created  by the  CopySnapshot action have an arbi-
                 trary volume ID that should not be used for any purpose.

              VolumeSize -> (integer)
                 The size of the volume, in GiB.

              OwnerAlias -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services owner  alias,  from  an  Amazon-main-
                 tained list (amazon ). This is not the user-configured Amazon
                 Web Services account alias set using the IAM console.

              OutpostArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the Outpost on which the snapshot is  stored.  For
                 more  information, see Amazon EBS local snapshots on Outposts
                 in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

              Tags -> (list)
                 Any tags assigned to the snapshot.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                        Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept  a
                        maximum  of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin with
                        aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

                        Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and  accept
                        a maximum of 255 Unicode characters.

              StorageTier -> (string)
                 The  storage  tier  in which the snapshot is stored. standard
                 indicates that the snapshot is stored in the  standard  snap-
                 shot storage tier and that it is ready for use. archive indi-
                 cates that the snapshot is currently  archived  and  that  it
                 must be restored before it can be used.

              RestoreExpiryTime -> (timestamp)
                 Only  for  archived  snapshots that are temporarily restored.
                 Indicates the date and time when a temporarily restored snap-
                 shot will be automatically re-archived.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  NextToken  value  to  include  in  a  future  DescribeSnapshots
          request. When the results  of  a  DescribeSnapshots  request  exceed
          MaxResults  ,  this  value  can be used to retrieve the next page of
          results. This value is null  when  there  are  no  more  results  to
          return.



                                                          DESCRIBE-SNAPSHOTS()
