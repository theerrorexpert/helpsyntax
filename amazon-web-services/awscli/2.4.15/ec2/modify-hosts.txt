MODIFY-HOSTS()                                                  MODIFY-HOSTS()



NAME
       modify-hosts -

DESCRIPTION
       Modify the auto-placement setting of a Dedicated Host. When auto-place-
       ment is enabled, any instances that you launch with a tenancy  of  host
       but  without a specific host ID are placed onto any available Dedicated
       Host in your account that has auto-placement enabled. When  auto-place-
       ment  is  disabled,  you need to provide a host ID to have the instance
       launch onto a specific host. If no host ID is provided, the instance is
       launched onto a suitable host with auto-placement enabled.

       You  can also use this API action to modify a Dedicated Host to support
       either multiple instance types in an instance family, or to  support  a
       specific instance type only.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-hosts
          [--auto-placement <value>]
          --host-ids <value>
          [--host-recovery <value>]
          [--instance-type <value>]
          [--instance-family <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --auto-placement (string)
          Specify whether to enable or disable auto-placement.

          Possible values:

          o on

          o off

       --host-ids (list)
          The IDs of the Dedicated Hosts to modify.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --host-recovery (string)
          Indicates  whether  to enable or disable host recovery for the Dedi-
          cated Host. For more information, see Host recovery  in  the  Amazon
          EC2 User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o on

          o off

       --instance-type (string)
          Specifies  the  instance type to be supported by the Dedicated Host.
          Specify this parameter to modify a Dedicated Host to support only  a
          specific instance type.

          If  you want to modify a Dedicated Host to support multiple instance
          types in its current instance family, omit this parameter and  spec-
          ify  InstanceFamily  instead.  You  cannot  specify InstanceType and
          InstanceFamily in the same request.

       --instance-family (string)
          Specifies the instance family to be supported by the Dedicated Host.
          Specify  this parameter to modify a Dedicated Host to support multi-
          ple instance types within its current instance family.

          If you want to  modify  a  Dedicated  Host  to  support  a  specific
          instance  type  only,  omit  this parameter and specify InstanceType
          instead. You cannot specify InstanceFamily and InstanceType  in  the
          same request.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To enable auto-placement for a Dedicated Host

       The  following  modify-hosts example enables auto-placement for a Dedi-
       cated Host so that it accepts any  untargeted  instance  launches  that
       match its instance type configuration.

          aws ec2 modify-hosts \
              --host-id h-06c2f189b4EXAMPLE \
              --auto-placement on

       Output:

          {
              "Successful": [
                  "h-06c2f189b4EXAMPLE"
              ],
              "Unsuccessful": []
          }

       Example 2: To enable host recovery for a Dedicated Host

       The following modify-hosts example enables host recovery for the speci-
       fied Dedicated Host.

          aws ec2 modify-hosts \
              --host-id h-06c2f189b4EXAMPLE \
              --host-recovery on

       Output:

          {
              "Successful": [
                  "h-06c2f189b4EXAMPLE"
              ],
              "Unsuccessful": []
          }
