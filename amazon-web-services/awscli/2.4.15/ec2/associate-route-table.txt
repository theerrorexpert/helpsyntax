ASSOCIATE-ROUTE-TABLE()                                ASSOCIATE-ROUTE-TABLE()



NAME
       associate-route-table -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  a subnet in your VPC or an internet gateway or virtual pri-
       vate gateway attached to your VPC with a route table in your VPC.  This
       association  causes  traffic  from  the  subnet or gateway to be routed
       according to the routes in the route table. The action returns an asso-
       ciation  ID,  which  you  need in order to disassociate the route table
       later. A route table can be associated with multiple subnets.

       For more information, see Route tables in the  Amazon  Virtual  Private
       Cloud User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            associate-route-table
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          --route-table-id <value>
          [--subnet-id <value>]
          [--gateway-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --route-table-id (string)
          The ID of the route table.

       --subnet-id (string)
          The ID of the subnet.

       --gateway-id (string)
          The ID of the internet gateway or virtual private gateway.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To associate a route table with a subnet

       This example associates the specified route table  with  the  specified
       subnet.

       Command:

          aws ec2 associate-route-table --route-table-id rtb-22574640 --subnet-id subnet-9d4a7b6c

       Output:

          {
              "AssociationId": "rtbassoc-781d0d1a"
          }

OUTPUT
       AssociationId -> (string)
          The route table association ID. This ID is required for disassociat-
          ing the route table.

       AssociationState -> (structure)
          The state of the association.

          State -> (string)
              The state of the association.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              The status message, if applicable.
