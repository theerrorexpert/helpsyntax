DESCRIBE-INSTANCE-STATUS()                          DESCRIBE-INSTANCE-STATUS()



NAME
       describe-instance-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  status  of  the  specified  instances  or  all  of your
       instances. By default, only running instances are described, unless you
       specifically indicate to return the status of all instances.

       Instance status includes the following components:

       o Status  checks  -  Amazon  EC2  performs status checks on running EC2
         instances to identify hardware and software issues. For more informa-
         tion, see Status checks for your instances and Troubleshoot instances
         with failed status checks in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

       o Scheduled events - Amazon EC2 can schedule events  (such  as  reboot,
         stop,  or  terminate)  for your instances related to hardware issues,
         software updates, or system maintenance. For  more  information,  see
         Scheduled events for your instances in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

       o Instance  state  -  You can manage your instances from the moment you
         launch them through their  termination.  For  more  information,  see
         Instance lifecycle in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-instance-status  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: InstanceStatuses

SYNOPSIS
            describe-instance-status
          [--filters <value>]
          [--instance-ids <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--include-all-instances | --no-include-all-instances]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          The filters.

          o availability-zone - The Availability Zone of the instance.

          o event.code - The code for the scheduled event  (instance-reboot  |
            system-reboot   |   system-maintenance   |  instance-retirement  |
            instance-stop ).

          o event.description - A description of the event.

          o event.instance-event-id - The ID of the event whose date and  time
            you are modifying.

          o event.not-after - The latest end time for the scheduled event (for
            example, 2014-09-15T17:15:20.000Z ).

          o event.not-before - The earliest start time for the scheduled event
            (for example, 2014-09-15T17:15:20.000Z ).

          o event.not-before-deadline  -  The  deadline for starting the event
            (for example, 2014-09-15T17:15:20.000Z ).

          o instance-state-code - The code for the instance state, as a 16-bit
            unsigned  integer. The high byte is used for internal purposes and
            should be ignored. The low byte is set based on the  state  repre-
            sented.  The valid values are 0 (pending), 16 (running), 32 (shut-
            ting-down), 48 (terminated), 64 (stopping), and 80 (stopped).

          o instance-state-name - The state of the instance (pending | running
            | shutting-down | terminated | stopping | stopped ).

          o instance-status.reachability  -  Filters  on instance status where
            the name is reachability (passed | failed | initializing |  insuf-
            ficient-data ).

          o instance-status.status - The status of the instance (ok | impaired
            | initializing | insufficient-data | not-applicable ).

          o system-status.reachability - Filters on system  status  where  the
            name  is  reachability  (passed | failed | initializing | insuffi-
            cient-data ).

          o system-status.status - The system status of  the  instance  (ok  |
            impaired | initializing | insufficient-data | not-applicable ).

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --instance-ids (list)
          The instance IDs.

          Default: Describes all your instances.

          Constraints: Maximum 100 explicitly specified instance IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --include-all-instances | --no-include-all-instances (boolean)
          When true , includes the health status for all instances. When false
          , includes the health status for running instances only.

          Default: false

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                        described for up to a week. If the event has been com-
                        pleted, this description  starts  with  the  following
                        text: [Completed].

                     NotAfter -> (timestamp)
                        The latest scheduled end time for the event.

                     NotBefore -> (timestamp)
                        The earliest scheduled start time for the event.

                     NotBeforeDeadline -> (timestamp)

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the instance.

              InstanceState -> (structure)
                 The  intended  state of the instance.  DescribeInstanceStatus
                 requires that an instance be in the running state.

                 Code -> (integer)
                     The state of the instance as a 16-bit unsigned integer.

                     The high  byte  is  all  of  the  bits  between  2^8  and
                     (2^16)-1,  which  equals  decimal  values between 256 and
                     65,535. These numerical values are used for internal pur-
                     poses and should be ignored.

                     The  low byte is all of the bits between 2^0 and (2^8)-1,
                     which equals decimal values between 0 and 255.

                     The valid values for instance-state-code will all  be  in
                     the range of the low byte and they are:

                     o 0 : pending

                     o 16 : running

                     o 32 : shutting-down

                     o 48 : terminated

                     o 64 : stopping

                     o 80 : stopped

                     You  can ignore the high byte value by zeroing out all of
                     the bits above 2^8 or 256 in decimal.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The current state of the instance.

              InstanceStatus -> (structure)
                 Reports impaired functionality that stems from issues  inter-
                 nal to the instance, such as impaired reachability.

                 Details -> (list)
                     The   system  instance  health  or  application  instance

                        ImpairedSince -> (timestamp)
                            The time  when  a  status  check  failed.  For  an
                            instance  that  was launched and impaired, this is
                            the time when the instance was launched.

                        Name -> (string)
                            The type of instance status.

                            The status.

                 Status -> (string)
                     The status.

              SystemStatus -> (structure)
                 Reports impaired functionality that stems from issues related
                 to  the  systems  that  support an instance, such as hardware
                 failures and network connectivity problems.

                 Details -> (list)
                     The  system  instance  health  or  application   instance

                        ImpairedSince -> (timestamp)
                            The  time  when  a  status  check  failed.  For an
                            instance that was launched and impaired,  this  is
                            the time when the instance was launched.

                        Name -> (string)
