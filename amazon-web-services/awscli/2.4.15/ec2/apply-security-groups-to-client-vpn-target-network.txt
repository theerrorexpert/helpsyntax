NAME
       apply-security-groups-to-client-vpn-target-network -

DESCRIPTION
       Applies  a security group to the association between the target network
       and the Client VPN endpoint. This action replaces the existing security
       groups with the specified security groups.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            apply-security-groups-to-client-vpn-target-network
          --client-vpn-endpoint-id <value>
          --vpc-id <value>
          --security-group-ids <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-vpn-endpoint-id (string)
          The ID of the Client VPN endpoint.

       --vpc-id (string)
          The ID of the VPC in which the associated target network is located.

       --security-group-ids (list)
          The IDs of the security groups to apply  to  the  associated  target
          network.  Up  to  5  security groups can be applied to an associated
          target network.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To apply security groups to a target network for a Client VPN endpoint

       The  following apply-security-groups-to-client-vpn-target-network exam-
       ple applies security  group  sg-01f6e627a89f4db32  to  the  association
       between the specified target network and Client VPN endpoint.

          aws ec2 apply-security-groups-to-client-vpn-target-network \
              --security-group-ids sg-01f6e627a89f4db32 \
              --vpc-id vpc-0e2110c2f324332e0 \
              --client-vpn-endpoint-id cvpn-endpoint-123456789123abcde

       Output:

          {
              "SecurityGroupIds": [
                  "sg-01f6e627a89f4db32"
              ]
          }

       istrator Guide.
