NAME

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  your  account's  Reserved  Instance listings in the Reserved
       Instance Marketplace.

       The Reserved Instance Marketplace matches sellers who  want  to  resell
       Reserved  Instance  capacity  that  they no longer need with buyers who
       want to purchase additional capacity.  Reserved  Instances  bought  and
       sold  through  the  Reserved  Instance  Marketplace work like any other
       Reserved Instances.

       As a seller, you choose to list some or all of your Reserved Instances,
       and  you  specify  the upfront price to receive for them. Your Reserved
       Instances are then listed in the Reserved Instance Marketplace and  are
       available for purchase.

       As  a  buyer, you specify the configuration of the Reserved Instance to
       purchase, and the Marketplace matches what you're  searching  for  with
       what's  available.  The  Marketplace  first  sells  the  lowest  priced
       Reserved Instances to you, and continues  to  sell  available  Reserved
       Instance  listings  to  you  until  your demand is met. You are charged
       based on the total price of all of the listings that you purchase.

       For more information, see Reserved Instance Marketplace in  the  Amazon
       EC2 User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            describe-reserved-instances-listings
          [--filters <value>]
          [--reserved-instances-id <value>]
          [--reserved-instances-listing-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          One or more filters.

          o reserved-instances-id - The ID of the Reserved Instances.

          o reserved-instances-listing-id  -  The ID of the Reserved Instances
            listing.

          o status - The status of the Reserved Instance  listing  (pending  |
            active | cancelled | closed ).

          o status-message - The reason for the status.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --reserved-instances-id (string)
          One or more Reserved Instance IDs.

       --reserved-instances-listing-id (string)
          One or more Reserved Instance listing IDs.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 that  the  request  is  idempotent. For more information, see
                 Ensuring Idempotency .

              CreateDate -> (timestamp)

                        only  one  price  schedule  can be active at any time.
                        Take, for example, a Reserved  Instance  listing  that
                        has  five months remaining in its term. When you spec-
                        ify price schedules for five months  and  two  months,
                        this  means  that schedule 1, covering the first three
                        months of the remaining term, will  be  active  during
                        months 5, 4, and 3. Then schedule 2, covering the last
                        two months of the term, will be active  for  months  2
                        and 1.
