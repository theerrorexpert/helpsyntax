DESCRIBE-IPAM-SCOPES()                                  DESCRIBE-IPAM-SCOPES()



NAME
       describe-ipam-scopes -

DESCRIPTION
       Get information about your IPAM scopes.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-ipam-scopes  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: IpamScopes

SYNOPSIS
            describe-ipam-scopes
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--ipam-scope-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without  actually making the request and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --filters (list)
          One or more filters for the request. For more information about fil-
          tering, see Filtering CLI output .

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --ipam-scope-ids (list)
          The IDs of the scopes you want information on.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is
          null when there are no more results to return.

       IpamScopes -> (list)
          The scopes you want information on.

          (structure)
              In  IPAM, a scope is the highest-level container within IPAM. An
              IPAM contains two default scopes. Each scope represents  the  IP
              space  for  a  single network. The private scope is intended for
              all private IP address space. The public scope is  intended  for
              all  public  IP  address  space.  Scopes  enable you to reuse IP
              addresses across multiple unconnected networks  without  causing
              IP address overlap or conflict.

              For  more information, see How IPAM works in the Amazon VPC IPAM
              User Guide

              OwnerId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account ID of the owner of the scope.

              IpamScopeId -> (string)
                 The ID of the scope.

              IpamScopeArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the scope.

              IpamArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the IPAM.

              IpamRegion -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services Region of the IPAM scope.

              IpamScopeType -> (string)
                 The type of the scope.

              IsDefault -> (boolean)
                 Defines if the scope is the default scope or not.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the scope.

              PoolCount -> (integer)

              State -> (string)
                 The state of the IPAM scope.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The  key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource.
                 Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value  as  the
                 filter  value. For example, to find all resources that have a
                 tag with  the  key  Owner  and  the  value  TeamA  ,  specify
                 tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                        Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept  a
                        maximum  of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin with

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

                        Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and  accept
                        a maximum of 255 Unicode characters.
