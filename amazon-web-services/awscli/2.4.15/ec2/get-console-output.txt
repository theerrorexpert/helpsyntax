GET-CONSOLE-OUTPUT()                                      GET-CONSOLE-OUTPUT()



NAME
       get-console-output -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets   the  console  output  for  the  specified  instance.  For  Linux
       instances, the instance console output displays the exact console  out-
       put  that would normally be displayed on a physical monitor attached to
       a computer. For Windows instances, the instance console output includes
       the last three system event log errors.

       By  default,  the  console output returns buffered information that was
       posted shortly after an instance transition state (start, stop, reboot,
       or  terminate).  This  information  is  available for at least one hour
       after the most recent post. Only the most recent 64 KB of console  out-
       put is available.

       You  can  optionally  retrieve  the latest serial console output at any
       time during  the  instance  lifecycle.  This  option  is  supported  on
       instance types that use the Nitro hypervisor.

       For  more  information,  see  Instance console output in the Amazon EC2
       User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            get-console-output
          --instance-id <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--latest | --no-latest]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The ID of the instance.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --latest | --no-latest (boolean)
          When  enabled, retrieves the latest console output for the instance.

          Default: disabled (false )

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To get the console output

       The following get-console-output example gets the  console  output  for
       the specified Linux instance.

          aws ec2 get-console-output \
              --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0

       Output:

          {
              "InstanceId": "i-1234567890abcdef0",
              "Timestamp": "2013-07-25T21:23:53.000Z",
              "Output": "..."
          }

       User Guide.

       Example 2: To get the latest console output

       The following get-console-output example gets the latest console output
       for the specified Linux instance.

          aws ec2 get-console-output \
              --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 \
              --latest \
              --output text

       Output:
