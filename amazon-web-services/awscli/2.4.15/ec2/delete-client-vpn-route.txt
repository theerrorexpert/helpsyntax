DELETE-CLIENT-VPN-ROUTE()                            DELETE-CLIENT-VPN-ROUTE()



NAME
       delete-client-vpn-route -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a route from a Client VPN endpoint. You can only delete routes
       that you manually added using the CreateClientVpnRoute action. You can-
       not delete routes that were automatically added when associating a sub-
       net. To remove routes that have been automatically added,  disassociate
       the target subnet from the Client VPN endpoint.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-client-vpn-route
          --client-vpn-endpoint-id <value>
          [--target-vpc-subnet-id <value>]
          --destination-cidr-block <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-vpn-endpoint-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the  Client  VPN endpoint from which the route is to be
          deleted.

       --target-vpc-subnet-id (string)
          The ID of the target subnet used by the route.

       --destination-cidr-block (string)
          The IPv4 address range,  in  CIDR  notation,  of  the  route  to  be
          deleted.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a route for a Client VPN endpoint

       The following delete-client-vpn-route  example  deletes  the  0.0.0.0/0
       route for the specified subnet of a Client VPN endpoint.

          aws ec2 delete-client-vpn-route \
              --client-vpn-endpoint-id cvpn-endpoint-123456789123abcde \
              --destination-cidr-block 0.0.0.0/0 \
              --target-vpc-subnet-id subnet-0123456789abcabca

       Output:

          {
              "Status": {
                  "Code": "deleting"
              }
          }

       For  more  information,  see Routes in the AWS Client VPN Administrator
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       Status -> (structure)
          The current state of the route.

          Code -> (string)
              The state of the Client VPN endpoint route.

          Message -> (string)
