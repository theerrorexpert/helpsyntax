NAME
       create-vpn-connection-route -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  static  route  associated  with a VPN connection between an
       existing virtual private gateway and a VPN customer gateway. The static
       route  allows  traffic to be routed from the virtual private gateway to
       the VPN customer gateway.

       For more information, see Amazon Web Services Site-to-Site VPN  in  the
       Amazon Web Services Site-to-Site VPN User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-vpn-connection-route
          --destination-cidr-block <value>
          --vpn-connection-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --destination-cidr-block (string)
          The CIDR block associated with the local subnet of the customer net-
          work.

       --vpn-connection-id (string)
          The ID of the VPN connection.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
