DESCRIBE-FLEET-HISTORY()                              DESCRIBE-FLEET-HISTORY()



NAME
       describe-fleet-history -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  events for the specified EC2 Fleet during the specified
       time.

       EC2 Fleet events are delayed by up to 30 seconds  before  they  can  be
       described.  This  ensures that you can query by the last evaluated time
       and not miss a recorded event. EC2 Fleet events are  available  for  48
       hours.

       For more information, see Monitor fleet events using Amazon EventBridge
       in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-fleet-history
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--event-type <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          --fleet-id <value>
          --start-time <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --event-type (string)
          The  type  of  events  to  describe.  By  default,  all  events  are
          described.

          Possible values:

          o instance-change

          o fleet-change

          o service-error

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return in a single call. Specify  a
          value between 1 and 1000. The default value is 1000. To retrieve the
          remaining results, make another call  with  the  returned  NextToken
          value.

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next set of results.

       --fleet-id (string)
          The ID of the EC2 Fleet.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The  start date and time for the events, in UTC format (for example,
          YYYY -MM -DD T*HH* :MM :SS Z).

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe EC2 Fleet history

       The following describe-fleet-history example returns  the  history  for
       the  specified  EC2 Fleet starting at the specified time. The output is
       for an EC2 Fleet with two running instances.

                        error events:

                     o iamFleetRoleInvalid  - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet does
                       not have the required permissions either to  launch  or
                       terminate an instance.

                     o allLaunchSpecsTemporarilyBlacklisted - None of the con-
                       figurations are valid, and several attempts  to  launch
                       instances  have  failed.  For more information, see the
                       description of the event.

                     o spotInstanceCountLimitExceeded  -  You've  reached  the
                       limit  on  the  number  of  Spot Instances that you can
                       launch.

                     o spotFleetRequestConfigurationInvalid -  The  configura-
                       tion  is  not  valid.  For  more  information,  see the
                       description of the event.
                        fleetRequestChange events:

                     o active - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request  has  been
                       validated  and Amazon EC2 is attempting to maintain the
                       target number of running instances.

                     o cancelled - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request is can-
                       celed  and  has  no running instances. The EC2 Fleet or
                       Spot Fleet will be deleted two days after its instances
                       are terminated.

                     o cancelled_running - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request
                       is canceled and does not launch  additional  instances.
                       Its  existing  instances continue to run until they are
                       interrupted or terminated. The request remains in  this
                       state  until  all  instances  are interrupted or termi-
                       nated.

                     o cancelled_terminating - The EC2  Fleet  or  Spot  Fleet
                       request  is canceled and its instances are terminating.
                       The request remains in this state until  all  instances
                       are terminated.

                     o expired  -  The  EC2  Fleet  or  Spot Fleet request has
                       expired. If the request was created  with  TerminateIn-
                       stancesWithExpiration   set,  a  subsequent  terminated
                       event indicates that the instances are terminated.

                     o modify_in_progress  -  The  EC2  Fleet  or  Spot  Fleet
                       request  is being modified. The request remains in this
                       state until the modification is fully processed.

                     o modify_succeeded - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet  request
                       was modified.

                     o submitted  -  The  EC2  Fleet  or Spot Fleet request is
                       being evaluated and Amazon EC2 is preparing  to  launch
                       the target number of instances.

                     o progress  -  The  EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request is in
                       the process of being fulfilled.
                        instanceChange events:

                     o launched - A new instance was launched.

                     o terminated - An instance was terminated by the user.

                     o termination_notified - An instance termination  notifi-
                       cation  was sent when a Spot Instance was terminated by
                       Amazon EC2 during scale-down, when the target  capacity
                       of  the  fleet  was  modified down, for example, from a
                       target capacity of 4 to a target capacity of 3.

                       fication  is  not  valid  because  it is below the Spot
                       price (all  the  launch  specifications  have  produced
                       launchSpecUnusable   events).  A  launch  specification
                       might become valid if the Spot price changes.

                     o launchSpecTemporarilyBlacklisted - The configuration is
                       not valid and several attempts to launch instances have
                       failed. For more information, see  the  description  of
                       the event.

                     o launchSpecUnusable  -  The price in a launch specifica-
                       tion is not valid because it is below the Spot price.

                     o registerWithLoadBalancersFailed - An attempt to  regis-
                       ter  instances  with  load  balancers  failed. For more
                       information, see the description of the event.

                 InstanceId -> (string)
                     The ID of the instance.  This  information  is  available
                     only for instanceChange events.

              EventType -> (string)
                 The event type.

              Timestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and time of the event, in UTC format (for example,
                 YYYY -MM -DD T*HH* :MM :SS Z).

       LastEvaluatedTime -> (timestamp)
          The last date and time for the events, in UTC format  (for  example,
          YYYY  -MM  -DD  T*HH*  :MM  :SS Z). All records up to this time were
          retrieved.

          If nextToken indicates that there are more results,  this  value  is
          not present.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results.

       FleetId -> (string)
          The ID of the EC Fleet.

       StartTime -> (timestamp)
          The  start date and time for the events, in UTC format (for example,
          YYYY -MM -DD T*HH* :MM :SS Z).
