MODIFY-CAPACITY-RESERVATION()                    MODIFY-CAPACITY-RESERVATION()



NAME
       modify-capacity-reservation -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  a  Capacity  Reservation's  capacity and the conditions under
       which it is to be released. You cannot change a Capacity  Reservation's
       instance  type,  EBS  optimization,  instance store settings, platform,
       Availability Zone, or instance eligibility. If you need to  modify  any
       of these attributes, we recommend that you cancel the Capacity Reserva-
       tion, and then create a new one with the required attributes.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-capacity-reservation
          --capacity-reservation-id <value>
          [--instance-count <value>]
          [--end-date <value>]
          [--end-date-type <value>]
          [--accept | --no-accept]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--additional-info <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --capacity-reservation-id (string)
          The ID of the Capacity Reservation.

       --instance-count (integer)
          The number of instances for which to reserve capacity. The number of
          instances  can't  be  increased  or decreased by more than 1000 in a
          single request.

       --end-date (timestamp)
          The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation expires. When  a
          Capacity  Reservation expires, the reserved capacity is released and
          you can no longer launch instances into it.  The  Capacity  Reserva-
          tion's  state  changes  to  expired when it reaches its end date and
          time.

          The Capacity Reservation is cancelled within an hour from the speci-
          fied  time.  For  example,  if  you specify 5/31/2019, 13:30:55, the
          Capacity Reservation is  guaranteed  to  end  between  13:30:55  and
          14:30:55 on 5/31/2019.

          You  must  provide an EndDate value if EndDateType is limited . Omit
          EndDate if EndDateType is unlimited .

       --end-date-type (string)
          Indicates the way in which the Capacity Reservation ends. A Capacity
          Reservation can have one of the following end types:

          o unlimited  -  The  Capacity  Reservation  remains active until you
            explicitly cancel it. Do not provide an EndDate value if  EndDate-
            Type is unlimited .

          o limited  -  The  Capacity  Reservation  expires automatically at a
            specified date and time. You must provide an EndDate value if End-
            DateType is limited .

          Possible values:

          o unlimited

          o limited

       --accept | --no-accept (boolean)
          Reserved.  Capacity  Reservations  you  have created are accepted by
          default.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --additional-info (string)
          Reserved for future use.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example  1:  To  change the number of instances reserved by an existing
       capacity reservation

       The following modify-capacity-reservation example changes the number of
       instances for which the capacity reservation reserves capacity.

          aws ec2 modify-capacity-reservation \
              --capacity-reservation-id cr-1234abcd56EXAMPLE \
              --instance-count 5

       Output:

          {
              "Return": true
          }

       Example  2:  To  change  the end date and time for an existing capacity
       reservation

       The following modify-capacity-reservation example modifies an  existing
       capacity reservation to end at the specified date and time.

          aws ec2 modify-capacity-reservation \
              --capacity-reservation-id cr-1234abcd56EXAMPLE \
              --end-date-type limited \
              --end-date 2019-08-31T23:59:59Z

OUTPUT
       Return -> (boolean)
          Returns true if the  request  succeeds;  otherwise,  it  returns  an
          error.
