NAME
       describe-addresses -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the specified Elastic IP addresses or all of your Elastic IP
       addresses.

       An Elastic IP address is for use in either the EC2-Classic platform  or
       in  a VPC. For more information, see Elastic IP Addresses in the Amazon
       Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-addresses
          [--filters <value>]
          [--public-ips <value>]
          [--allocation-ids <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          One or more filters. Filter names and values are case-sensitive.

          o allocation-id - [EC2-VPC] The allocation ID for the address.

          o association-id - [EC2-VPC] The association ID for the address.

          o domain - Indicates whether the address is for use  in  EC2-Classic
            (standard ) or in a VPC (vpc ).

          o instance-id  -  The  ID  of the instance the address is associated
            with, if any.

          o network-border-group - A unique set of Availability  Zones,  Local
            Zones,  or  Wavelength Zones from where Amazon Web Services adver-
            tises IP addresses.

          o network-interface-id - [EC2-VPC] The ID of the  network  interface
            that the address is associated with, if any.

          o network-interface-owner-id - The Amazon Web Services account ID of
            the owner.

          o private-ip-address - [EC2-VPC] The private IP  address  associated
            with the Elastic IP address.

          o public-ip - The Elastic IP address, or the carrier IP address.

          o tag  :<key>  -  The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the
            resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value  as
            the  filter  value. For example, to find all resources that have a
            tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA , specify tag:Owner for
            the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

          o tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this fil-
            ter to find all resources assigned a  tag  with  a  specific  key,
            regardless of the tag value.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --public-ips (list)
          One or more Elastic IP addresses.

          Default: Describes all your Elastic IP addresses.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --allocation-ids (list)
          [EC2-VPC] Information about the allocation IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
