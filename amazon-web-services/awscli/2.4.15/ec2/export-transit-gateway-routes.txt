EXPORT-TRANSIT-GATEWAY-ROUTES()                EXPORT-TRANSIT-GATEWAY-ROUTES()



NAME
       export-transit-gateway-routes -

DESCRIPTION
       Exports  routes  from  the specified transit gateway route table to the
       specified S3 bucket. By default,  all  routes  are  exported.  Alterna-
       tively, you can filter by CIDR range.

       The  routes  are saved to the specified bucket in a JSON file. For more
       information, see Export Route Tables to Amazon S3 in Transit Gateways .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            export-transit-gateway-routes
          --transit-gateway-route-table-id <value>
          [--filters <value>]
          --s3-bucket <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --transit-gateway-route-table-id (string)
          The ID of the route table.

       --filters (list)
          One or more filters. The possible values are:

          o attachment.transit-gateway-attachment-id  -  The id of the transit
            gateway attachment.

          o attachment.resource-id - The resource id of  the  transit  gateway
            attachment.

          o route-search.exact-match  -  The exact match of the specified fil-
            ter.

          o route-search.longest-prefix-match  -  The  longest   prefix   that
            matches the route.

          o route-search.subnet-of-match - The routes with a subnet that match
            the specified CIDR filter.

          o route-search.supernet-of-match -  The  routes  with  a  CIDR  that
            encompass  the  CIDR  filter. For example, if you have 10.0.1.0/29
            and 10.0.1.0/31 routes in your route table and you specify  super-
            net-of-match  as 10.0.1.0/30, then the result returns 10.0.1.0/29.

          o state - The state of the route (active | blackhole ).

          o transit-gateway-route-destination-cidr-block - The CIDR range.

          o type - The type of route (propagated | static ).

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --s3-bucket (string)
          The name of the S3 bucket.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       S3Location -> (string)
          The   URL   of   the  exported  file  in  Amazon  S3.  For  example,
          s3://bucket_name           /VPCTransitGateway/TransitGatewayRouteTa-
          bles/file_name .
