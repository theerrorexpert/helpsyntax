REGISTER-TRANSIT-GATEWAY-MULREGISTER-TRANSIT-GATEWAY-MULTICAST-GROUP-MEMBERS()



NAME
       register-transit-gateway-multicast-group-members -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers  members (network interfaces) with the transit gateway multi-
       cast group. A member is a network interface associated with a supported
       EC2  instance  that  receives  multicast traffic. For information about
       supported instances, see Multicast Consideration in Amazon VPC  Transit
       Gateways .

       After  you  add the members, use SearchTransitGatewayMulticastGroups to
       verify that the members were added to  the  transit  gateway  multicast
       group.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            register-transit-gateway-multicast-group-members
          [--transit-gateway-multicast-domain-id <value>]
          [--group-ip-address <value>]
          [--network-interface-ids <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --transit-gateway-multicast-domain-id (string)
          The ID of the transit gateway multicast domain.

       --group-ip-address (string)
          The IP address assigned to the transit gateway multicast group.

       --network-interface-ids (list)
          The  group members' network interface IDs to register with the tran-
          sit gateway multicast group.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To  view  the  information  about  the transit gateway multicast domain
       associations

       The following register-transit-gateway-multicast-group-members  example
       returns the associations for the specified multicast domain.

          aws ec2 register-transit-gateway-multicast-group-members \
              --transit-gateway-multicast-domain-id tgw-mcast-domain-0c4905cef79d6e597 \
              --group-ip-address 224.0.1.0 \
              --network-interface-ids eni-0e246d32695012e81

       Output:

          {
              "RegisteredMulticastGroupMembers": {
                  "TransitGatewayMulticastDomainId": "tgw-mcast-domain-0c4905cef79d6e597",
                  "RegisteredNetworkInterfaceIds": [
                      "eni-0e246d32695012e81"
                  ],
                  "GroupIpAddress": "224.0.1.0"
              }
          }
