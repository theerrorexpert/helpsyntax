NAME
       describe-aggregate-id-format -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  longer  ID  format settings for all resource types in a
       specific Region. This request is useful for performing a quick audit to
       determine  whether  a  specific Region is fully opted in for longer IDs
       (17-character IDs).

       This request only returns information about resource types that support
       longer IDs.

       The  following  resource  types  support  longer  IDs: bundle | conver-
       sion-task | customer-gateway | dhcp-options |  elastic-ip-allocation  |
       elastic-ip-association | export-task | flow-log | image | import-task |
       instance | internet-gateway | network-acl |  network-acl-association  |
       network-interface | network-interface-attachment | prefix-list | reser-
       vation | route-table | route-table-association | security-group | snap-
       shot  |  subnet  |  subnet-cidr-block-association  |  volume  |  vpc  |
       vpc-cidr-block-association | vpc-endpoint  |  vpc-peering-connection  |
       vpn-connection | vpn-gateway .

SYNOPSIS
            describe-aggregate-id-format
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe the longer ID format settings for all resource types  in  a
       Region

       The  following describe-aggregate-id-format example describes the over-
       all long ID format status for the current Region.  The  Deadline  value
       indicates  that the deadlines for these resources to permanently switch
       from the short ID format to the long ID format expired. The  UseLongId-
       sAggregated  value  indicates that all IAM users and IAM roles are con-
       figured to use long ID format for all resource types.

          aws ec2 describe-aggregate-id-format

       Output:

          {
              "UseLongIdsAggregated": true,
              "Statuses": [
                  {
                      "Deadline": "2018-08-13T02:00:00.000Z",
                      "Resource": "network-interface-attachment",
                      "UseLongIds": true
                  },
                  {
                      "Deadline": "2016-12-13T02:00:00.000Z",
                      "Resource": "instance",
                      "UseLongIds": true
                  },
                  {
                      "Deadline": "2018-08-13T02:00:00.000Z",
                      "Resource": "elastic-ip-association",
                      "UseLongIds": true
                  },
                  ...
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       UseLongIdsAggregated -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether all resource types in the Region are configured to
          use  longer IDs. This value is only true if all users are configured
          to use longer IDs for all resources types in the Region.

       Statuses -> (list)
          Information about each resource's ID format.

          (structure)
              Describes the ID format for a resource.

              Deadline -> (timestamp)
                 The date in UTC at which you are permanently switched over to
                 using longer IDs. If a deadline is not yet available for this
                 resource type, this field is not returned.

              Resource -> (string)
                 The type of resource.

              UseLongIds -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether longer IDs (17-character IDs)  are  enabled
                 for the resource.
