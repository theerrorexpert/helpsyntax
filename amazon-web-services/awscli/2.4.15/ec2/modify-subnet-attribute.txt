MODIFY-SUBNET-ATTRIBUTE()                            MODIFY-SUBNET-ATTRIBUTE()



NAME
       modify-subnet-attribute -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  a  subnet  attribute.  You can only modify one attribute at a
       time.

       Use this action to modify subnets on Amazon Web Services Outposts.

       o To modify a subnet on an Outpost rack, set both MapCustomerOwnedIpOn-
         Launch and CustomerOwnedIpv4Pool . These two parameters act as a sin-
         gle attribute.

       o To modify a subnet on an Outpost server, set either  EnableLniAtDevi-
         ceIndex or DisableLniAtDeviceIndex .

       For  more  information about Amazon Web Services Outposts, see the fol-
       lowing:

       o Outpost servers

       o Outpost racks

OPTIONS
       --assign-ipv6-address-on-creation  |   --no-assign-ipv6-address-on-cre-
       ation (structure)
          Specify  true  to  indicate  that  network interfaces created in the
          specified subnet should be assigned an IPv6 address. This includes a
          network interface that's created when launching an instance into the
          subnet (the instance therefore receives an IPv6 address).

          If you enable the IPv6 addressing feature for your subnet, your net-
          work  interface  or  instance  only receives an IPv6 address if it's
          created using version 2016-11-15 or later of the Amazon EC2 API.

          Value -> (boolean)
              The attribute value. The valid values are true or false .

       --map-public-ip-on-launch | --no-map-public-ip-on-launch (structure)
          Specify  true  to  indicate  that  network  interfaces  attached  to
          instances  created in the specified subnet should be assigned a pub-
          lic IPv4 address.

          Value -> (boolean)
              The attribute value. The valid values are true or false .

       --subnet-id (string)
          The ID of the subnet.

       --map-customer-owned-ip-on-launch            |            --no-map-cus-
       tomer-owned-ip-on-launch (structure)
          Specify  true  to  indicate  that  network  interfaces  attached  to
          instances created in the specified subnet should be assigned a  cus-
          tomer-owned IPv4 address.

          When  this  value  is  true , you must specify the customer-owned IP
          pool using CustomerOwnedIpv4Pool .

          Value -> (boolean)
              The attribute value. The valid values are true or false .

       --customer-owned-ipv4-pool (string)
          The customer-owned IPv4 address pool associated with the subnet.

          You  must  set  this  value  when  you  specify  true  for   MapCus-
          tomerOwnedIpOnLaunch .

       --enable-dns64 | --no-enable-dns64 (structure)
          Indicates  whether  DNS  queries  made  to  the  Amazon-provided DNS
          Resolver in this subnet should return synthetic IPv6  addresses  for
          IPv4-only destinations.

          Value -> (boolean)
              The attribute value. The valid values are true or false .

       --private-dns-hostname-type-on-launch (string)
          The  type  of  hostnames  to  assign  to  instances in the subnet at
          launch. For IPv4 only subnets, an instance DNS name must be based on
          the  instance  IPv4  address. For IPv6 only subnets, an instance DNS
          name must be based on the instance ID. For dual-stack  subnets,  you
          can  specify  whether DNS names use the instance IPv4 address or the
          instance ID.

          Possible values:

          o ip-name

          o resource-name

       --enable-resource-name-dns-a-record-on-launch                         |
       --no-enable-resource-name-dns-a-record-on-launch (structure)
          Indicates  whether  to respond to DNS queries for instance hostnames
          with DNS A records.

          Value -> (boolean)
              The attribute value. The valid values are true or false .

       --enable-resource-name-dns-aaaa-record-on-launch                      |
       --no-enable-resource-name-dns-aaaa-record-on-launch (structure)
          Indicates  whether  to respond to DNS queries for instance hostnames
          with DNS AAAA records.

          Value -> (boolean)
              The attribute value. The valid values are true or false .

       --enable-lni-at-device-index (integer)
          Indicates the device position for local network interfaces  in  this
          subnet.  For  example,  1 indicates local network interfaces in this
          subnet are the secondary network interface (eth1). A  local  network
          interface cannot be the primary network interface (eth0).

       --disable-lni-at-device-index     |    --no-disable-lni-at-device-index
       (structure)
          Specify true to indicate that local network interfaces at  the  cur-
          rent position should be disabled.

          Value -> (boolean)
              The attribute value. The valid values are true or false .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To change a subnet's public IPv4 addressing behavior

       This  example  modifies  subnet-1a2b3c4d  to specify that all instances
       launched into this subnet are assigned a public IPv4  address.  If  the
       command succeeds, no output is returned.

       Command:

          aws ec2 modify-subnet-attribute --subnet-id subnet-1a2b3c4d --map-public-ip-on-launch

       To change a subnet's IPv6 addressing behavior

       This  example  modifies  subnet-1a2b3c4d  to specify that all instances
       launched into this subnet are assigned an IPv6 address from  the  range
       of the subnet.

       Command:

          aws ec2 modify-subnet-attribute --subnet-id subnet-1a2b3c4d --assign-ipv6-address-on-creation

OUTPUT
       None
