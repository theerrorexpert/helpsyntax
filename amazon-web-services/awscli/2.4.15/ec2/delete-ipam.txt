DELETE-IPAM()                                                    DELETE-IPAM()



NAME
       delete-ipam -

DESCRIPTION
       Delete  an IPAM. Deleting an IPAM removes all monitored data associated
       with the IPAM including the historical data for CIDRs.

       NOTE:
          You cannot delete an IPAM if there are CIDRs provisioned to pools or
          if  there  are allocations in the pools within the IPAM. To deprovi-
          sion pool CIDRs, see DeprovisionIpamPoolCidr .  To  release  alloca-
          tions, see ReleaseIpamPoolAllocation .

       For  more  information,  see Delete an IPAM in the Amazon VPC IPAM User
       Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-ipam
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          --ipam-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without  actually making the request and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --ipam-id (string)
          The ID of the IPAM to delete.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete an IPAM

       The following delete-ipam example deletes an IPAM.

          aws ec2 delete-ipam \
              --ipam-id ipam-036486dfa6af58ee0

              The ID of the IPAM's default public scope.

          PrivateDefaultScopeId -> (string)

              The number of scopes in the IPAM. The scope quota is 5. For more
              information on quotas, see Quotas in IPAM in the Amazon VPC IPAM
