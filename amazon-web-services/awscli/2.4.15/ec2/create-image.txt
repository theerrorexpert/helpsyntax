CREATE-IMAGE()                                                  CREATE-IMAGE()



NAME
       create-image -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  Amazon  EBS-backed  AMI from an Amazon EBS-backed instance
       that is either running or stopped.

       If you customized your instance with instance store volumes  or  Amazon
       EBS volumes in addition to the root device volume, the new AMI contains
       block device mapping information for those volumes. When you launch  an
       instance  from  this  new AMI, the instance automatically launches with
       those additional volumes.

       For more information, see Creating Amazon EBS-Backed Linux AMIs in  the
       Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --block-device-mappings (list)
          The  block  device mappings. This parameter cannot be used to modify
          the encryption status of existing volumes or snapshots. To create an
          AMI with encrypted snapshots, use the  CopyImage action.

          (structure)
              Describes  a block device mapping, which defines the EBS volumes
              and instance store volumes to attach to an instance at launch.

              DeviceName -> (string)
                 The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh ).

              VirtualName -> (string)
                 The virtual device name (ephemeral N). Instance store volumes
                 are  numbered starting from 0. An instance type with 2 avail-
                 able  instance  store  volumes  can  specify   mappings   for
                 ephemeral0  and ephemeral1 . The number of available instance
                 store volumes depends on the instance type. After you connect
                 to the instance, you must mount the volume.

                 NVMe  instance store volumes are automatically enumerated and
                 assigned a device name. Including them in your  block  device
                 mapping has no effect.

                 Constraints:  For  M3  instances,  you  must specify instance
                 store volumes in the block device mapping for  the  instance.
                 When  you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance store
                 volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI.

              Ebs -> (structure)
                 Parameters used to automatically set up EBS volumes when  the
                 instance is launched.

                 DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                     Indicates  whether  the EBS volume is deleted on instance
                     termination. For more information, see Preserving  Amazon
                     EBS  volumes  on  instance  termination in the Amazon EC2
                     User Guide .

                 Iops -> (integer)
                     The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For gp3 ,
                     io1 , and io2 volumes, this represents the number of IOPS
                     that are provisioned for the  volume.  For  gp2  volumes,
                     this  represents  the  baseline performance of the volume
                     and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O  credits
                     for bursting.

                     The  following  are  the supported values for each volume
                     type:

                     o gp3 : 3,000-16,000 IOPS

                     o io1 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                     o io2 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                     For io1 and io2 volumes, we guarantee  64,000  IOPS  only
                     for  Instances built on the Nitro System . Other instance
                     families guarantee performance up to 32,000 IOPS.

                     This parameter is required for io1 and io2  volumes.  The
                     default  for gp3 volumes is 3,000 IOPS. This parameter is
                     not supported for gp2 , st1 , sc1 , or standard  volumes.

                 SnapshotId -> (string)
                     The ID of the snapshot.

                 VolumeSize -> (integer)
                     The  size of the volume, in GiBs. You must specify either
                     a snapshot ID or a volume size. If you  specify  a  snap-
                     shot, the default is the snapshot size. You can specify a
                     volume size that is equal to or larger than the  snapshot
                     size.

                     The  following  are  the supported volumes sizes for each
                     volume type:

                     o gp2 and gp3 :1-16,384

                     o io1 and io2 : 4-16,384

                     o st1 and sc1 : 125-16,384

                     o standard : 1-1,024

                 VolumeType -> (string)
                     The volume type. For more  information,  see  Amazon  EBS
                     volume types in the Amazon EC2 User Guide . If the volume
                     type is io1 or io2 , you must specify the IOPS  that  the
                     volume supports.

                 KmsKeyId -> (string)
                     Identifier  (key ID, key alias, ID ARN, or alias ARN) for
                     a customer managed CMK under  which  the  EBS  volume  is
                     encrypted.

                     This  parameter  is  only supported on BlockDeviceMapping
                     objects called by RunInstances , RequestSpotFleet  ,  and
                     RequestSpotInstances .

                 Throughput -> (integer)
                     The throughput that the volume supports, in MiB/s.

                     This parameter is valid only for gp3 volumes.

                     Valid Range: Minimum value of 125. Maximum value of 1000.

                 OutpostArn -> (string)
                     The ARN of the Outpost on which the snapshot is stored.

                 Encrypted -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether the encryption state of an  EBS  volume
                     is  changed while being restored from a backing snapshot.
                     The effect  of  setting  the  encryption  state  to  true
                     depends  on  the  volume origin (new or from a snapshot),
                     starting encryption state, ownership, and whether encryp-
                     tion  by  default  is  enabled. For more information, see
                     Amazon EBS encryption in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

                     In no case can you remove encryption  from  an  encrypted
                     volume.

                     Encrypted  volumes can only be attached to instances that
                     support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information,  see
                     Supported instance types .

                     This parameter is not returned by .

              NoDevice -> (string)
                 To  omit the device from the block device mapping, specify an
                 empty string. When this property is specified, the device  is
                 removed  from  the  block  device  mapping  regardless of the
                 assigned value.

            {
              "DeviceName": "string",
              "VirtualName": "string",
              "Ebs": {
                "DeleteOnTermination": true|false,
                "Iops": integer,
                "SnapshotId": "string",

              "NoDevice": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --description (string)
          A description for the new image.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --instance-id (string)
          The ID of the instance.

       --name (string)
          A name for the new image.

          Constraints: 3-128 alphanumeric characters, parentheses (()), square
          brackets ([]), spaces ( ), periods (.),  slashes  (/),  dashes  (-),
          single quotes ('), at-signs (@), or underscores(_)

       --no-reboot | --reboot (boolean)
          By default, Amazon EC2 attempts to shut down and reboot the instance
          before creating the image. If the No Reboot option  is  set,  Amazon
          EC2  doesn't shut down the instance before creating the image. With-
          out a reboot, the AMI will be crash consistent (all the volumes  are
          snapshotted  at  the same time), but not application consistent (all
          the operating system buffers are not  flushed  to  disk  before  the
          snapshots are created).

       --tag-specifications (list)
          The  tags to apply to the AMI and snapshots on creation. You can tag
          the AMI, the snapshots, or both.

          o To tag the AMI, the value for ResourceType must be image .

          o To tag the snapshots that are created of the root  volume  and  of
            other  Amazon  EBS  volumes that are attached to the instance, the
            value for ResourceType must be snapshot . The same tag is  applied
            to all of the snapshots that are created.

          If you specify other values for ResourceType , the request fails.

          To  tag an AMI or snapshot after it has been created, see CreateTags
          .

          (structure)
              The tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being  cre-
              ated.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of resource to tag on creation.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The tags to apply to the resource.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                        Constraints:  Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a
                        maximum of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin  with
                        aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

                        Constraints:  Tag values are case-sensitive and accept
                        a maximum of 255 Unicode characters.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To create an AMI from an Amazon EBS-backed instance

       The following create-image example creates an AMI  from  the  specified
       instance.

          aws ec2 create-image \
              --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 \
              --name "My server" \
              --description "An AMI for my server"

       Output:

          {
              "ImageId": "ami-0eab20fe36f83e1a8"
          }

       AMI, see Specifying a block device mapping for an AMI in the Amazon EC2
       User Guide.

       Example  2: To create an AMI from an Amazon EBS-backed instance without
       reboot

       The  following  create-image  example  creates  an  AMI  and  sets  the
       --no-reboot  parameter, so that the instance is not rebooted before the
       image is created.

          aws ec2 create-image \
              --instance-id i-0b09a25c58929de26 \
              --name "My server" \
              --no-reboot

       Output:

          {
              "ImageId": "ami-01d7dcccb80665a0f"
          }
