AUTHORIZE-CLIENT-VPN-INGRESS()                  AUTHORIZE-CLIENT-VPN-INGRESS()



NAME
       authorize-client-vpn-ingress -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  an  ingress  authorization rule to a Client VPN endpoint. Ingress
       authorization rules act as firewall rules that  grant  access  to  net-
       works. You must configure ingress authorization rules to enable clients
       to access resources in Amazon Web Services or on-premises networks.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            authorize-client-vpn-ingress
          --client-vpn-endpoint-id <value>
          --target-network-cidr <value>
          [--access-group-id <value>]
          [--authorize-all-groups | --no-authorize-all-groups]
          [--description <value>]
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-vpn-endpoint-id (string)
          The ID of the Client VPN endpoint.

       --target-network-cidr (string)
          The IPv4 address range, in CIDR notation, of the network  for  which
          access is being authorized.

       --access-group-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the  group  to grant access to, for example, the Active
          Directory group or identity provider (IdP) group. Required if Autho-
          rizeAllGroups is false or not specified.

       --authorize-all-groups | --no-authorize-all-groups (boolean)
          Indicates  whether  to  grant access to all clients. Specify true to
          grant all clients who successfully establish a VPN connection access
          to  the  network. Must be set to true if AccessGroupId is not speci-
          fied.

       --description (string)
          A brief description of the authorization rule.

       --client-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you  provide  to  ensure  the
          idempotency  of the request. For more information, see How to ensure
          idempotency .

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To add an authorization rule for a Client VPN endpoint

       The  following  authorize-client-vpn-ingress  example  adds  an ingress
       authorization rule that permits all  clients  to  access  the  internet
       (0.0.0.0/0).

          aws ec2 authorize-client-vpn-ingress \
              --client-vpn-endpoint-id cvpn-endpoint-123456789123abcde \
              --target-network-cidr 0.0.0.0/0 \
              --authorize-all-groups

       Output:

          {
              "Status": {
                  "Code": "authorizing"
              }
          }

       For  more  information,  see  Authorization Rules in the AWS Client VPN
       Administrator Guide.

OUTPUT
       Status -> (structure)
          The current state of the authorization rule.

          Code -> (string)
              The state of the authorization rule.

          Message -> (string)
              A message about the status of the authorization rule, if  appli-
              cable.
