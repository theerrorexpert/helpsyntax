NAME
       purchase-reserved-instances-offering -

DESCRIPTION
       Purchases  a Reserved Instance for use with your account. With Reserved
       Instances, you pay a lower hourly rate compared to  On-Demand  instance
       pricing.

       Use   DescribeReservedInstancesOfferings  to  get  a  list  of Reserved
       Instance offerings that match your specifications.  After  you've  pur-
       chased  a  Reserved  Instance,  you  can  check  for  your new Reserved
       Instance with  DescribeReservedInstances .

       To queue a purchase for a future date  and  time,  specify  a  purchase
       time. If you do not specify a purchase time, the default is the current
       time.

       For more information, see Reserved Instances and Reserved Instance Mar-
       ketplace in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            purchase-reserved-instances-offering
          --instance-count <value>
          --reserved-instances-offering-id <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--limit-price <value>]
          [--purchase-time <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-count (integer)
          The number of Reserved Instances to purchase.

       --reserved-instances-offering-id (string)
          The ID of the Reserved Instance offering to purchase.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --limit-price (structure)
          Specified for Reserved Instance Marketplace offerings to  limit  the
          total order and ensure that the Reserved Instances are not purchased
          at unexpected prices.

          Amount -> (double)
              Used for Reserved Instance Marketplace offerings. Specifies  the
              limit price on the total order (instanceCount * price).

          CurrencyCode -> (string)
              The  currency  in  which  the limitPrice amount is specified. At
              this time, the only supported currency is USD .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Amount=double,CurrencyCode=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Amount": double,
            "CurrencyCode": "USD"
          }

       --purchase-time (timestamp)
          The time at which to purchase the Reserved Instance, in  UTC  format
          (for example, YYYY -MM -DD T*HH* :MM :SS Z).

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To purchase a Reserved Instance offering

       This  example  command  illustrates  a purchase of a Reserved Instances
       offering, specifying an offering ID and instance count.

       Command:

          aws ec2 purchase-reserved-instances-offering --reserved-instances-offering-id ec06327e-dd07-46ee-9398-75b5fexample --instance-count 3

       Output:

          {
            "ReservedInstancesId": "af9f760e-6f91-4559-85f7-4980eexample"
          }

OUTPUT
       ReservedInstancesId -> (string)
          The IDs of  the  purchased  Reserved  Instances.  If  your  purchase
          crosses into a discounted pricing tier, the final Reserved Instances

          in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .
