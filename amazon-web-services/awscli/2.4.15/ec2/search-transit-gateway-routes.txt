NAME
       search-transit-gateway-routes -

DESCRIPTION
       Searches for routes in the specified transit gateway route table.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            search-transit-gateway-routes
          --transit-gateway-route-table-id <value>
          --filters <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --transit-gateway-route-table-id (string)
          The ID of the transit gateway route table.

       --filters (list)
          One or more filters. The possible values are:

          o attachment.transit-gateway-attachment-id  -  The id of the transit
            gateway attachment.

          o attachment.resource-id - The resource id of  the  transit  gateway
            attachment.

          o attachment.resource-type  -  The  attachment  resource type. Valid
            values are vpc | vpn | direct-connect-gateway | peering |  connect
            .

          o prefix-list-id - The ID of the prefix list.

          o route-search.exact-match  -  The exact match of the specified fil-
            ter.

          o route-search.longest-prefix-match  -  The  longest   prefix   that
            matches the route.

          o route-search.subnet-of-match - The routes with a subnet that match
            the specified CIDR filter.

          o route-search.supernet-of-match -  The  routes  with  a  CIDR  that
            encompass  the  CIDR  filter. For example, if you have 10.0.1.0/29
            and 10.0.1.0/31 routes in your route table and you specify  super-
            net-of-match  as 10.0.1.0/30, then the result returns 10.0.1.0/29.

          o state - The state of the route (active | blackhole ).

          o type - The type of route (propagated | static ).

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of routes to return.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To search for routes in the specified transit gateway route table

       The  following  search-transit-gateway-routes  example  returns all the
       routes that are of type static in the specified route table.

          aws ec2 search-transit-gateway-routes \
              --transit-gateway-route-table-id tgw-rtb-0a823edbdeEXAMPLE \
              --filters "Name=type,Values=static"

       Output:

          {
              "Routes": [
