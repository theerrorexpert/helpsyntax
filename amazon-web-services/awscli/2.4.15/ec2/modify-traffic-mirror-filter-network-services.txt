MODIFY-TRAFFIC-MIRROR-FILTER-NEMODIFY-TRAFFIC-MIRROR-FILTER-NETWORK-SERVICES()



NAME
       modify-traffic-mirror-filter-network-services -

DESCRIPTION
       Allows or restricts mirroring network services.

       By  default,  Amazon  DNS network services are not eligible for Traffic
       Mirror. Use AddNetworkServices to add network  services  to  a  Traffic
       Mirror  filter.  When  a network service is added to the Traffic Mirror
       filter, all traffic related to that network service will  be  mirrored.
       When  you no longer want to mirror network services, use RemoveNetwork-
       Services to remove the network services from the Traffic Mirror filter.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-traffic-mirror-filter-network-services
          --traffic-mirror-filter-id <value>
          [--add-network-services <value>]
          [--remove-network-services <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --traffic-mirror-filter-id (string)
          The ID of the Traffic Mirror filter.

       --add-network-services (list)
          The  network  service, for example Amazon DNS, that you want to mir-
          ror.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            amazon-dns

       --remove-network-services (list)
          The network service, for example Amazon DNS, that you no longer want
          to mirror.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            amazon-dns

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To add network services to a Traffic Mirror filter

       The  following  modify-traffic-mirror-filter-network-services   example
       adds the Amazon DNS network services to the specified filter.
