NAME
       get-host-reservation-purchase-preview -

DESCRIPTION
       Preview  a reservation purchase with configurations that match those of
       your Dedicated Host. You must  have  active  Dedicated  Hosts  in  your
       account before you purchase a reservation.

       This  is  a preview of the  PurchaseHostReservation action and does not
       result in the offering being purchased.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-host-reservation-purchase-preview
          --host-id-set <value>
          --offering-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --host-id-set (list)
          The IDs of the Dedicated Hosts with which the reservation is associ-
          ated.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --offering-id (string)
          The offering ID of the reservation.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
