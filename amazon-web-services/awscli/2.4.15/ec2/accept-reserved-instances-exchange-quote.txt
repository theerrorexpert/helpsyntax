SYNOPSIS
            accept-reserved-instances-exchange-quote
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          --reserved-instance-ids <value>
          [--target-configurations <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --reserved-instance-ids (list)
          The  IDs  of  the  Convertible  Reserved  Instances  to exchange for
          another Convertible Reserved Instance of the same or higher value.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --target-configurations (list)
          The configuration of the target  Convertible  Reserved  Instance  to
          exchange for your current Convertible Reserved Instances.

          (structure)
              Details about the target configuration.

              InstanceCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  instances  the Convertible Reserved Instance
                 offering can be applied to. This parameter  is  reserved  and
                 cannot be specified in a request

              OfferingId -> (string)
                 The Convertible Reserved Instance offering ID.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          InstanceCount=integer,OfferingId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "InstanceCount": integer,
              "OfferingId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
