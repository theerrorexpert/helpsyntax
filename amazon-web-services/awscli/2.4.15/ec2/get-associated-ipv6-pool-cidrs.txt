GET-ASSOCIATED-IPV6-POOL-CIDRS()              GET-ASSOCIATED-IPV6-POOL-CIDRS()



NAME
       get-associated-ipv6-pool-cidrs -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about the IPv6 CIDR block associations for a specified
       IPv6 address pool.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-associated-ipv6-pool-cidrs is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: Ipv6CidrAssociations

SYNOPSIS
            get-associated-ipv6-pool-cidrs
          --pool-id <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pool-id (string)
          The ID of the IPv6 address pool.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the associations for an IPv6 address pool

       The  following get-associated-ipv6-pool-cidrs example gets the associa-
       tions for the specified IPv6 address pool.

          aws ec2 get-associated-ipv6-pool-cidrs \
              --pool-id ipv6pool-ec2-012345abc12345abc

       Output:

          {
              "Ipv6CidrAssociations": [
                  {
                      "Ipv6Cidr": "2001:db8:1234:1a00::/56",
                      "AssociatedResource": "vpc-111111222222333ab"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Ipv6CidrAssociations -> (list)
          Information about the IPv6 CIDR block associations.

          (structure)
              Describes an IPv6 CIDR block association.

              Ipv6Cidr -> (string)
                 The IPv6 CIDR block.

              AssociatedResource -> (string)
                 The resource that's associated with the IPv6 CIDR block.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is
          null when there are no more results to return.
