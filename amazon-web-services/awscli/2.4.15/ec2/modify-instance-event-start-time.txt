NAME
       modify-instance-event-start-time -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies the start time for a scheduled Amazon EC2 instance event.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-instance-event-start-time
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          --instance-id <value>
          --instance-event-id <value>
          --not-before <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --instance-id (string)
          The ID of the instance with the scheduled event.

       --instance-event-id (string)
          The ID of the event whose date and time you are modifying.

       --not-before (timestamp)
          The new date and time when the event will take place.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To modify the event start time for an instance

       The following modify-instance-event-start-time  command  shows  how  to
       modify  the  event  start  time for the specified instance. Specify the
       event ID by using the --instance-event-id parameter.  Specify  the  new
       date and time by using the --not-before parameter.

          aws ec2 modify-instance-event-start-time --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 --instance-event-id instance-event-0abcdef1234567890 --not-before 2019-03-25T10:00:00.000

       Output:

          "Event": {
              "InstanceEventId": "instance-event-0abcdef1234567890",
              "Code": "system-reboot",
              "Description": "scheduled reboot",
              "NotAfter": "2019-03-25T12:00:00.000Z",
              "NotBefore": "2019-03-25T10:00:00.000Z",
              "NotBeforeDeadline": "2019-04-22T21:00:00.000Z"
          }

OUTPUT
       Event -> (structure)
          Describes a scheduled event for an instance.

          InstanceEventId -> (string)
              The ID of the event.

              tion starts with the following text: [Completed].

          NotAfter -> (timestamp)
              The latest scheduled end time for the event.

          NotBefore -> (timestamp)
