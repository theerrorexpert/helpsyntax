NAME
       modify-vpn-connection -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  the  customer  gateway or the target gateway of an Amazon Web
       Services Site-to-Site VPN connection. To modify the target gateway, the
       following migration options are available:

       o An existing virtual private gateway to a new virtual private gateway

       o An existing virtual private gateway to a transit gateway

       o An existing transit gateway to a new transit gateway

       o An existing transit gateway to a virtual private gateway

       Before you perform the migration to the new gateway, you must configure
       the new gateway. Use  CreateVpnGateway  to  create  a  virtual  private
       gateway, or  CreateTransitGateway to create a transit gateway.

       This  step  is required when you migrate from a virtual private gateway
       with static routes to a transit gateway.

       You must delete the static routes before you migrate to the  new  gate-
       way.

       Keep  a copy of the static route before you delete it. You will need to
       add back these routes to the transit gateway after the  VPN  connection
       migration is complete.

       After you migrate to the new gateway, you might need to modify your VPC
       route table. Use  CreateRoute and   DeleteRoute  to  make  the  changes
       described  in  Update  VPC  route  tables  in  the  Amazon Web Services
       Site-to-Site VPN User Guide .

       When the new gateway is a transit gateway, modify the  transit  gateway
       route  table  to  allow traffic between the VPC and the Amazon Web Ser-
       vices Site-to-Site VPN connection.  Use   CreateTransitGatewayRoute  to
       add the routes.

       If you deleted VPN static routes, you must add the static routes to the
       transit gateway route table.

       After you perform this operation, the VPN endpoint's  IP  addresses  on
       the Amazon Web Services side and the tunnel options remain intact. Your
       Amazon Web Services Site-to-Site VPN  connection  will  be  temporarily
       unavailable for a brief period while we provision the new endpoints.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-vpn-connection
          --vpn-connection-id <value>
          [--transit-gateway-id <value>]
          [--customer-gateway-id <value>]
          [--vpn-gateway-id <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --vpn-connection-id (string)
          The ID of the VPN connection.

       --transit-gateway-id (string)
          The ID of the transit gateway.

       --customer-gateway-id (string)
          The ID of the customer gateway at your end of the VPN connection.

       --vpn-gateway-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the  virtual private gateway at the Amazon Web Services
          side of the VPN connection.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
