CREATE-NAT-GATEWAY()                                      CREATE-NAT-GATEWAY()



NAME
       create-nat-gateway -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  NAT  gateway in the specified subnet. This action creates a
       network interface in the specified subnet with  a  private  IP  address
       from the IP address range of the subnet. You can create either a public
       NAT gateway or a private NAT gateway.

       With a public NAT gateway, internet-bound traffic from a private subnet
       can be routed to the NAT gateway, so that instances in a private subnet
       can connect to the internet.

       With a private NAT gateway, private communication is routed across VPCs
       and  on-premises  networks through a transit gateway or virtual private
       gateway. Common use cases include  running  large  workloads  behind  a
       small  pool  of  allowlisted  IPv4  addresses,  preserving private IPv4
       addresses, and communicating between overlapping networks.

       For more information, see NAT gateways in the  Amazon  Virtual  Private
       Cloud User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            create-nat-gateway
          [--allocation-id <value>]
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          --subnet-id <value>
          [--tag-specifications <value>]

          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --allocation-id (string)
          [Public  NAT  gateways  only]  The  allocation  ID  of an Elastic IP
          address to associate with the NAT gateway.  You  cannot  specify  an
          Elastic  IP  address  with  a private NAT gateway. If the Elastic IP
          address is associated with another resource, you must first disasso-
          ciate it.

       --client-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive  identifier  that  you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. For more information, see How to  ensure
          idempotency .

          Constraint: Maximum 64 ASCII characters.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --subnet-id (string)
          The subnet in which to create the NAT gateway.

       --tag-specifications (list)
          The tags to assign to the NAT gateway.

          (structure)
              The tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being  cre-
              ated.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of resource to tag on creation.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The tags to apply to the resource.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                        Constraints:  Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a
                        maximum of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin  with
                        aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

                        Constraints:  Tag values are case-sensitive and accept
                        a maximum of 255 Unicode characters.

       JSON Syntax:

            ...
          ]

       --connectivity-type (string)
          Indicates whether the NAT gateway supports public or private connec-
          tivity. The default is public connectivity.

          Possible values:

          o private

          o public

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To create a public NAT gateway

       The  following  create-nat-gateway example creates a public NAT gateway
       in the specified subnet and associates the Elastic IP address with  the
       specified allocation ID. When you create a public NAT gateway, you must
       associate an Elastic IP address.

          aws ec2 create-nat-gateway \
              --subnet-id subnet-0250c25a1fEXAMPLE \
              --allocation-id eipalloc-09ad461b0dEXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "NatGateway": {
                  "CreateTime": "2021-12-01T22:22:38.000Z",
                  "NatGatewayAddresses": [
                      {
                          "AllocationId": "eipalloc-09ad461b0dEXAMPLE"
                      }
                  ],
                  "NatGatewayId": "nat-0c61bf8a12EXAMPLE",
                  "State": "pending",
                  "SubnetId": "subnet-0250c25a1fEXAMPLE",
                  "VpcId": "vpc-0a60eb65b4EXAMPLE",
                  "ConnectivityType": "public"
              }
          }

       For more information, see NAT gateways in the Amazon VPC User Guide.

       Example 2: To create a private NAT gateway

       The following create-nat-gateway example creates a private NAT  gateway
       in the specified subnet. A private NAT gateway does not have an associ-
       ated Elastic IP address.

          aws ec2 create-nat-gateway \
              --subnet-id subnet-0250c25a1fEXAMPLE \
              --connectivity-type private

       Output:

          {
              "NatGateway": {
                  "CreateTime": "2021-12-01T22:26:00.000Z",
                  "NatGatewayAddresses": [
                      {}
                  ],
                  "NatGatewayId": "nat-011b568379EXAMPLE",
                  "State": "pending",
                  "SubnetId": "subnet-0250c25a1fEXAMPLE",
                  "VpcId": "vpc-0a60eb65b4EXAMPLE",
                  "ConnectivityType": "private"
              }
          }
