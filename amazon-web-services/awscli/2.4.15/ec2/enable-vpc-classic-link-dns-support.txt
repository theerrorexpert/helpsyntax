NAME
       enable-vpc-classic-link-dns-support -

DESCRIPTION
       Enables  a  VPC  to support DNS hostname resolution for ClassicLink. If
       enabled, the DNS hostname of a linked EC2-Classic instance resolves  to
       its  private  IP  address when addressed from an instance in the VPC to
       which it's linked. Similarly, the DNS hostname of an instance in a  VPC
       resolves  to  its  private  IP  address  when  addressed  from a linked
       EC2-Classic instance. For more information, see ClassicLink in the Ama-
       zon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

       You must specify a VPC ID in the request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            enable-vpc-classic-link-dns-support
          [--vpc-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --vpc-id (string)
          The ID of the VPC.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To enable ClassicLink DNS support for a VPC

       This example enables ClassicLink DNS support for vpc-88888888.

       Command:

          aws ec2 enable-vpc-classic-link-dns-support --vpc-id vpc-88888888

       Output:

          {
            "Return": true
          }

OUTPUT
       Return -> (boolean)
          Returns  true  if  the  request  succeeds;  otherwise, it returns an
          error.
