CREATE-INSTANCE-EVENT-WINDOW()                  CREATE-INSTANCE-EVENT-WINDOW()



NAME
       create-instance-event-window -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  event  window in which scheduled events for the associated
       Amazon EC2 instances can run.

       You can define either a set of time ranges or a  cron  expression  when
       creating  the event window, but not both. All event window times are in
       UTC.

       You can create up to 200 event windows per Amazon Web Services  Region.

       When you create the event window, targets (instance IDs, Dedicated Host
       IDs, or tags) are not yet associated with it. To ensure that the  event
       window  can  be used, you must associate one or more targets with it by
       using the  AssociateInstanceEventWindow API.

       WARNING:
          Event windows are applicable only for scheduled  events  that  stop,
          reboot, or terminate instances.

          Event windows are not applicable for:

          o Expedited scheduled events and network maintenance events.

          o Unscheduled   maintenance   such  as  AutoRecovery  and  unplanned
            reboots.

       For more information, see Define event windows for scheduled events  in
       the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --name (string)
          The name of the event window.

       --time-ranges (list)
          The time range for the event window. If you specify  a  time  range,
          you can't specify a cron expression.

          (structure)
              The  start  day  and  time  and the end day and time of the time
              range, in UTC.

              StartWeekDay -> (string)
                 The day on which the time range begins.

              StartHour -> (integer)
                 The hour when the time range begins.

              EndWeekDay -> (string)
                 The day on which the time range ends.

              EndHour -> (integer)
                 The hour when the time range ends.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          The cron expression for the event window, for example, * 0-4,20-23 *
          *  1,5  . If you specify a cron expression, you can't specify a time
          range.

          Constraints:

          o Only hour and day of the week values are supported.

          o For day of the week values, you  can  specify  either  integers  0
            through 6 , or alternative single values SUN through SAT .

          o The minute, month, and year must be specified by * .

          o The  hour  value must be one or a multiple range, for example, 0-4
            or 0-4,20-23 .

          o Each hour range must be >= 2 hours, for example, 0-2 or 20-23 .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
