SYNOPSIS
            describe-fleet-instances
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          --fleet-id <value>
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of results to return in a single call. Specify a
          value between 1 and 1000. The default value is 1000. To retrieve the
          remaining  results,  make  another  call with the returned NextToken
          value.

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next set of results.

       --fleet-id (string)
          The ID of the EC2 Fleet.

       --filters (list)
          The filters.

          o instance-type - The instance type.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe the running instances for an EC2 Fleet

       The following describe-fleet-instances example  describes  the  running
       instances for the specified EC2 Fleet.

          aws ec2 describe-fleet-instances \
              --fleet-id 12a34b55-67cd-8ef9-ba9b-9208dEXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "ActiveInstances": [
                  {
                      "InstanceId": "i-090db02406cc3c2d6",
                      "InstanceType": "t2.small",
                      "SpotInstanceRequestId": "sir-a43gtpfk",
                      "InstanceHealth": "healthy"
                  },
                  {
                      "InstanceId": "i-083a1c446e66085d2",
                      "InstanceType": "t2.small",
                      "SpotInstanceRequestId": "sir-iwcit2nj",
                      "InstanceHealth": "healthy"
                  }
              ],
              "FleetId": "fleet-12a34b55-67cd-8ef9-ba9b-9208dEXAMPLE"
          }

          be out of date.

          (structure)
              Describes a running instance in a Spot Fleet.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the instance.

              InstanceType -> (string)
                 The instance type.

              SpotInstanceRequestId -> (string)
