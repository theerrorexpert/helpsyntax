SYNOPSIS
            create-store-image-task
          --image-id <value>
          --bucket <value>
          [--s3-object-tags <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --image-id (string)
          The ID of the AMI.

       --bucket (string)
          The name of the Amazon S3 bucket in which the  AMI  object  will  be
          stored.  The  bucket  must  be in the Region in which the request is
          being made. The AMI object appears in  the  bucket  only  after  the
          upload task has completed.

       --s3-object-tags (list)
          The  tags to apply to the AMI object that will be stored in the Ama-
          zon S3 bucket.

          (structure)
              The tags to apply to the AMI object that will be stored  in  the
              Amazon  S3  bucket.  For more information, see Categorizing your
              storage using tags in the Amazon  Simple  Storage  Service  User
              Guide .

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

                 Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and can be up to 128
                 Unicode characters in length. May not begin with aws :.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

                 Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and can be  up  to
                 256 Unicode characters in length.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To store an AMI

       The following create-store-image-task example stores the specified  AMI
       in the specified S3 bucket.

          aws ec2 create-store-image-task \
              --image-id ami-1234567890abcdef0 \
              --bucket myamibucket

       Output:

          {
              "ObjectKey": "ami-1234567890abcdef0.bin"
          }

       For  more  information,  see Store and restore an AMI in the Amazon EC2
       User Guide.

OUTPUT
       ObjectKey -> (string)
          The name of the stored AMI object in the S3 bucket.
