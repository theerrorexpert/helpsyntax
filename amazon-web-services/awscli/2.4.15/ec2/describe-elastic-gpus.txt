SYNOPSIS
            describe-elastic-gpus
          [--elastic-gpu-ids <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --elastic-gpu-ids (list)
          The Elastic Graphics accelerator IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --filters (list)
          The filters.

          o availability-zone - The Availability Zone  in  which  the  Elastic
            Graphics accelerator resides.

          o elastic-gpu-health  - The status of the Elastic Graphics accelera-
            tor (OK | IMPAIRED ).

          o elastic-gpu-state - The state of the Elastic Graphics  accelerator
            (ATTACHED ).

          o elastic-gpu-type  -  The type of Elastic Graphics accelerator; for
            example, eg1.medium .

          o instance-id - The ID of the instance to which the Elastic Graphics
            accelerator is associated.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  results  to  return  in  a single call. To
          retrieve the remaining results, make another call with the  returned
          NextToken value. This value can be between 5 and 1000.

       --next-token (string)
          The token to request the next page of results.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 ator is attached.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The tags assigned to the Elastic Graphics accelerator.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a tag.

                     Key -> (string)

                        Constraints:  Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a
                        maximum of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin  with
                        aws: .

       MaxResults -> (integer)
          The total number of items to return. If the total  number  of  items
          available  is  more  than  the  value  specified in max-items then a

          pagination.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is
          null when there are no more results to return.
