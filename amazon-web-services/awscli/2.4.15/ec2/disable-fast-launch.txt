DISABLE-FAST-LAUNCH()                                    DISABLE-FAST-LAUNCH()



NAME
       disable-fast-launch -

DESCRIPTION
       Discontinue  faster  launching for a Windows AMI, and clean up existing
       pre-provisioned snapshots. When you disable faster launching,  the  AMI
       uses the standard launch process for each instance. All pre-provisioned
       snapshots must be removed before you can enable faster launching again.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disable-fast-launch
          --image-id <value>
          [--force | --no-force]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --image-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the image for which youre turning off faster launching,
          and removing pre-provisioned snapshots.

       --force | --no-force (boolean)
          Forces the image settings to turn off faster launching for your Win-
          dows  AMI.  This parameter overrides any errors that are encountered
          while cleaning up resources in your account.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ImageId -> (string)
          The  ID of the image for which faster-launching has been turned off.

       ResourceType -> (string)
          The pre-provisioning resource type that must be cleaned after  turn-
          ing  off  faster  launching  for  the  Windows AMI. Supported values
          include: snapshot .

       SnapshotConfiguration -> (structure)
          Parameters that were used for faster launching for the  Windows  AMI
          before  faster  launching  was turned off. This informs the clean-up
          process.

          TargetResourceCount -> (integer)
              The number of pre-provisioned snapshots  requested  to  keep  on
              hand for a fast-launch enabled Windows AMI.

       LaunchTemplate -> (structure)
          The  launch  template that was used to launch Windows instances from
          pre-provisioned snapshots.

          LaunchTemplateId -> (string)
              The ID of the launch template for faster launching of the  asso-
              ciated Windows AMI.

          LaunchTemplateName -> (string)
              The  name  of  the  launch  template for faster launching of the
              associated Windows AMI.

          Version -> (string)
              The version of the launch template for faster launching  of  the
              associated Windows AMI.

       MaxParallelLaunches -> (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  parallel  instances to launch for creating
          resources.

       OwnerId -> (string)
          The owner of the Windows AMI for which faster launching  was  turned
          off.

       State -> (string)
          The current state of faster launching for the specified Windows AMI.

       StateTransitionReason -> (string)
          The reason that the state changed for faster launching for the  Win-
          dows AMI.

       StateTransitionTime -> (timestamp)
          The time that the state changed for faster launching for the Windows
          AMI.
