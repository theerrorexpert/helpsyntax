DELETE-VPC-ENDPOINTS()                                  DELETE-VPC-ENDPOINTS()



NAME
       delete-vpc-endpoints -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  one or more specified VPC endpoints. You can delete any of the
       following types of VPC endpoints.

       o Gateway endpoint,

       o Gateway Load Balancer endpoint,

       o Interface endpoint

       The following rules apply when you delete a VPC endpoint:

       o When you delete a gateway endpoint, we delete the endpoint routes  in
         the route tables that are associated with the endpoint.

       o When  you delete a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint, we delete the end-
         point network interfaces.  You can only delete Gateway Load  Balancer
         endpoints  when  the routes that are associated with the endpoint are
         deleted.

       o When you delete an interface endpoint, we delete the endpoint network
         interfaces.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-vpc-endpoints
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          --vpc-endpoint-ids <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --vpc-endpoint-ids (list)
          One or more VPC endpoint IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete an endpoint

       This example deletes endpoints vpce-aa22bb33 and vpce-1a2b3c4d. If  the
       command is partially successful or unsuccessful, a list of unsuccessful
       items is returned. If the command succeeds, the returned list is empty.

       Command:

          aws ec2 delete-vpc-endpoints --vpc-endpoint-ids vpce-aa22bb33 vpce-1a2b3c4d

       Output:

          {
            "Unsuccessful": []
          }

OUTPUT
       Unsuccessful -> (list)
          Information  about  the  VPC  endpoints  that  were not successfully
          deleted.

          (structure)
              Information about items that were not successfully processed  in
              a batch call.

              Error -> (structure)
                 Information about the error.

                 Code -> (string)
                     The error code.

                 Message -> (string)
                     The error message accompanying the error code.

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the resource.
