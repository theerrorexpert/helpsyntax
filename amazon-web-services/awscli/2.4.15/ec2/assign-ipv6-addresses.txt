ASSIGN-IPV6-ADDRESSES()                                ASSIGN-IPV6-ADDRESSES()



NAME
       assign-ipv6-addresses -

DESCRIPTION
       Assigns  one or more IPv6 addresses to the specified network interface.
       You can specify one or more specific IPv6 addresses, or you can specify
       the  number  of IPv6 addresses to be automatically assigned from within
       the subnet's IPv6 CIDR  block  range.  You  can  assign  as  many  IPv6
       addresses  to  a  network  interface  as  you  can  assign private IPv4
       addresses, and the limit varies per instance type. For information, see
       IP  Addresses  Per  Network  Interface  Per Instance Type in the Amazon
       Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

       You must specify either the IPv6 addresses or the IPv6 address count in
       the request.

       You  can optionally use Prefix Delegation on the network interface. You
       must specify either the IPV6 Prefix Delegation prefixes,  or  the  IPv6
       Prefix  Delegation  count.  For  information, see Assigning prefixes to
       Amazon EC2 network interfaces in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud  User
       Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            assign-ipv6-addresses
          [--ipv6-address-count <value>]
          [--ipv6-addresses <value>]
          [--ipv6-prefix-count <value>]
          [--ipv6-prefixes <value>]
          --network-interface-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --ipv6-address-count (integer)
          The  number  of  additional  IPv6 addresses to assign to the network
          interface. The specified number of IPv6 addresses  are  assigned  in
          addition to the existing IPv6 addresses that are already assigned to
          the network interface. Amazon EC2  automatically  selects  the  IPv6
          addresses from the subnet range. You can't use this option if speci-
          fying specific IPv6 addresses.

       --ipv6-addresses (list)
          One or more specific IPv6 addresses to be assigned  to  the  network
          interface.  You  can't use this option if you're specifying a number
          of IPv6 addresses.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --ipv6-prefix-count (integer)
          The number of IPv6 prefixes that Amazon Web  Services  automatically
          assigns  to the network interface. You cannot use this option if you
          use the Ipv6Prefixes option.

       --ipv6-prefixes (list)
          One or more IPv6 prefixes assigned to  the  network  interface.  You
          cannot use this option if you use the Ipv6PrefixCount option.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --network-interface-id (string)
          The ID of the network interface.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To assign specific IPv6 addresses to a network interface

       This example assigns the specified IPv6 addresses to the specified net-
       work interface.

       Command:

          aws ec2 assign-ipv6-addresses --network-interface-id eni-38664473 --ipv6-addresses 2001:db8:1234:1a00:3304:8879:34cf:4071 2001:db8:1234:1a00:9691:9503:25ad:1761

       Output:

          {
            "AssignedIpv6Addresses": [
                "2001:db8:1234:1a00:3304:8879:34cf:4071",
                "2001:db8:1234:1a00:9691:9503:25ad:1761"
            ],
            "NetworkInterfaceId": "eni-38664473"
          }

       To assign IPv6 addresses that Amazon selects to a network interface

       This example assigns two IPv6 addresses to the specified network inter-
       face. Amazon automatically assigns these IPv6 addresses from the avail-
       able IPv6 addresses in the IPv6 CIDR block range of the subnet.

       Command:

          aws ec2 assign-ipv6-addresses --network-interface-id eni-38664473 --ipv6-address-count 2

       Output:

          {
            "AssignedIpv6Addresses": [
                "2001:db8:1234:1a00:3304:8879:34cf:4071",
                "2001:db8:1234:1a00:9691:9503:25ad:1761"
            ],
            "NetworkInterfaceId": "eni-38664473"
          }

OUTPUT
       AssignedIpv6Addresses -> (list)
          The new IPv6 addresses assigned to the network  interface.  Existing
          IPv6  addresses  that  were assigned to the network interface before
          the request are not included.

          (string)

       AssignedIpv6Prefixes -> (list)
          The IPv6 prefixes that are assigned to the network interface.

          (string)

       NetworkInterfaceId -> (string)
          The ID of the network interface.
