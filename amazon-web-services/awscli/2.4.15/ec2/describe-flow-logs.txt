DESCRIBE-FLOW-LOGS()                                      DESCRIBE-FLOW-LOGS()



NAME
       describe-flow-logs -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  one  or more flow logs. To view the information in your flow
       logs (the log streams for the network interfaces),  you  must  use  the
       CloudWatch Logs console or the CloudWatch Logs API.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-flow-logs  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: FlowLogs

SYNOPSIS
            describe-flow-logs
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--filter <value>]
          [--flow-log-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --filter (list)
          One or more filters.

          o deliver-log-status  -  The  status of the logs delivery (SUCCESS |
            FAILED ).

          o log-destination-type - The type of destination to which  the  flow
            log   publishes   data.   Possible   destination   types   include
            cloud-watch-logs and s3 .

          o flow-log-id - The ID of the flow log.

          o log-group-name - The name of the log group.

          o resource-id - The ID of the VPC, subnet, or network interface.

          o traffic-type - The type of traffic (ACCEPT | REJECT | ALL ).

          o tag :<key> - The key/value combination of a tag  assigned  to  the
            resource.  Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as
            the filter value. For example, to find all resources that  have  a
            tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA , specify tag:Owner for
            the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

          o tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this fil-
            ter  to  find  all  resources  assigned a tag with a specific key,
            regardless of the tag value.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --flow-log-ids (list)
          One or more flow log IDs.

          Constraint: Maximum of 1000 flow log IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          }

       Example 2: To describe a subset of your flow logs

       The following describe-flow-logs  example  uses  a  filter  to  display
       details for only those flow logs that are in the specified log group in
       Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

          aws ec2 describe-flow-logs \
              --filter "Name=log-group-name,Values=MyFlowLogs"

OUTPUT
       FlowLogs -> (list)
          Information about the flow logs.

          (structure)
              Describes a flow log.

                 The date and time the flow log was created.

              DeliverLogsErrorMessage -> (string)
                 Information about the error that occurred. Rate limited indi-
                 cates  that  CloudWatch  Logs throttling has been applied for
                 one or more network interfaces, or that  you've  reached  the
                 limit on the number of log groups that you can create. Access
                 error indicates that the IAM role associated  with  the  flow
                 log does not have sufficient permissions to publish to Cloud-
                 Watch Logs. Unknown error indicates an internal error.

              TrafficType -> (string)
                 The type of traffic captured for the flow log.

              LogDestinationType -> (string)
                 The type of destination to which the flow log  data  is  pub-
                 lished.  Flow log data can be published to CloudWatch Logs or
                 Amazon S3.

              LogDestination -> (string)

                 The maximum interval of time, in seconds, during which a flow
                 of packets is captured and aggregated into a flow log record.

                 When  a  network  interface  is  attached  to  a  Nitro-based
                 instance  ,  the aggregation interval is always 60 seconds (1
                 minute) or less, regardless of the specified value.

                 Valid Values: 60 | 600
