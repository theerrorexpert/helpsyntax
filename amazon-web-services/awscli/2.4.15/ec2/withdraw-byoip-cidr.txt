WITHDRAW-BYOIP-CIDR()                                    WITHDRAW-BYOIP-CIDR()



NAME
       withdraw-byoip-cidr -

DESCRIPTION
       Stops  advertising  an  address range that is provisioned as an address
       pool.

       You can perform this operation at most once every 10 seconds,  even  if
       you specify different address ranges each time.

       It  can  take  a  few minutes before traffic to the specified addresses
       stops routing to Amazon Web Services because of BGP propagation delays.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            withdraw-byoip-cidr
          --cidr <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cidr (string)
          The address range, in CIDR notation.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To stop advertising an address range

       The following withdraw-byoip-cidr example stops advertising the  speci-
       fied address range.

          aws ec2 withdraw-byoip-cidr
              --cidr 203.0.113.25/24

       Output:

          {
              "ByoipCidr": {
                  "Cidr": "203.0.113.25/24",
                  "StatusMessage": "ipv4pool-ec2-1234567890abcdef0",
                  "State": "advertised"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       ByoipCidr -> (structure)
          Information about the address pool.

          Cidr -> (string)
              The address range, in CIDR notation.

          Description -> (string)
              The description of the address range.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              Upon  success,  contains  the ID of the address pool. Otherwise,
              contains an error message.

          State -> (string)
              The state of the address pool.
