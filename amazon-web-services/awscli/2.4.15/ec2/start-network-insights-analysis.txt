              ]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --client-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you  provide  to  ensure  the

          idempotency .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To analyze a path

       The following start-network-insights-analysis example analyzes the path
       between  the  source  and  destination. To view the results of the path
       analysis, use the describe-network-insights-analyses command.

          aws ec2 start-network-insights-analysis \
              --network-insights-path-id nip-0b26f224f1d131fa8

       Output:
