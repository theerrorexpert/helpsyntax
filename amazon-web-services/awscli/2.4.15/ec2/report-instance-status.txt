REPORT-INSTANCE-STATUS()                              REPORT-INSTANCE-STATUS()



NAME
       report-instance-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Submits  feedback about the status of an instance. The instance must be
       in the running state. If your experience with the instance differs from
       the   instance   status   returned  by   DescribeInstanceStatus  ,  use
       ReportInstanceStatus to report your experience with the instance.  Ama-
       zon  EC2  collects  this  information to improve the accuracy of status
       checks.

       Use of this action does not change the value returned  by   DescribeIn-
       stanceStatus .

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.

          o instance-stuck-in-state : My instance is stuck in a state.

          o unresponsive : My instance is unresponsive.

          o not-accepting-credentials : My instance is not accepting  my  cre-
            dentials.

          o password-not-available  :  A  password  is  not  available  for my
            instance.

          o performance-network :  My  instance  is  experiencing  performance
            problems that I believe are network related.

          o performance-instance-store  :  My instance is experiencing perfor-
            mance problems that I believe are related to the instance  stores.

          o performance-ebs-volume  :  My instance is experiencing performance
            problems that I believe are related to an EBS volume.

          o performance-other : My instance is experiencing performance  prob-
            lems.

          o other : [explain using the description parameter]

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            instance-stuck-in-state
            unresponsive
            not-accepting-credentials
            password-not-available
            performance-network
            performance-instance-store
            performance-ebs-volume
            performance-other
            other

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The time at which the reported instance health state began.

       --status (string)
          The status of all instances listed.

          Possible values:

          o ok

          o impaired

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
