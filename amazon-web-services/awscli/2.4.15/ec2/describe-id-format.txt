DESCRIBE-ID-FORMAT()                                      DESCRIBE-ID-FORMAT()



NAME
       describe-id-format -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  ID  format  settings for your resources on a per-Region
       basis, for example, to view which resource types are enabled for longer
       IDs.  This  request only returns information about resource types whose
       ID formats can be modified; it does not return information about  other
       resource types.

       The  following  resource  types  support  longer  IDs: bundle | conver-
       sion-task | customer-gateway | dhcp-options |  elastic-ip-allocation  |
       elastic-ip-association | export-task | flow-log | image | import-task |
       instance | internet-gateway | network-acl |  network-acl-association  |
       network-interface | network-interface-attachment | prefix-list | reser-
       vation | route-table | route-table-association | security-group | snap-
       shot  |  subnet  |  subnet-cidr-block-association  |  volume  |  vpc  |
       vpc-cidr-block-association | vpc-endpoint  |  vpc-peering-connection  |
       vpn-connection | vpn-gateway .

       These settings apply to the IAM user who makes the request; they do not
       apply to the entire Amazon Web Services account.  By  default,  an  IAM
       user  defaults  to  the  same  settings  as  the root user, unless they
       explicitly override the settings by running  the   ModifyIdFormat  com-
       mand.  Resources  created with longer IDs are visible to all IAM users,
       regardless of these settings and provided that they have permission  to
       use the relevant Describe command for the resource type.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-id-format
          [--resource <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource (string)
          The  type of resource: bundle | conversion-task | customer-gateway |
          dhcp-options  |  elastic-ip-allocation  |  elastic-ip-association  |
          export-task  |  flow-log  |  image | import-task | instance | inter-
          net-gateway | network-acl | network-acl-association | network-inter-
          face  |  network-interface-attachment  | prefix-list | reservation |
          route-table | route-table-association | security-group | snapshot  |
          subnet   |   subnet-cidr-block-association   |   volume   |   vpc  |
          vpc-cidr-block-association | vpc-endpoint | vpc-peering-connection |
          vpn-connection | vpn-gateway

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To describe the ID format of a resource

       The  following  describe-id-format  example describes the ID format for
       security groups.

          aws ec2 describe-id-format \
              --resource security-group

       In the following example output, the Deadline value indicates that  the
       deadline for this resource type to permanently switch from the short ID
       format to the long ID format expired at 00:00 UTC on August 15, 2018.

          {
              "Statuses": [
                  {
                      "Deadline": "2018-08-15T00:00:00.000Z",
                      "Resource": "security-group",
                      "UseLongIds": true
                  }
              ]
          }

       Example 2: To describe the ID format for all resources

       The following describe-id-format example describes the  ID  format  for
       all resource types. All resource types that supported the short ID for-
       mat were switched to use the long ID format.

          aws ec2 describe-id-format

OUTPUT
       Statuses -> (list)
          Information about the ID format for the resource.

          (structure)
              Describes the ID format for a resource.

              Deadline -> (timestamp)
                 The date in UTC at which you are permanently switched over to
                 using longer IDs. If a deadline is not yet available for this
                 resource type, this field is not returned.

              Resource -> (string)
                 The type of resource.

              UseLongIds -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether longer IDs (17-character IDs)  are  enabled
                 for the resource.
