DESCRIBE-IMAGES()                                            DESCRIBE-IMAGES()



NAME
       describe-images -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the specified images (AMIs, AKIs, and ARIs) available to you
       or all of the images available to you.

       The images available to you include public images, private images  that
       you own, and private images owned by other Amazon Web Services accounts
       for which you have explicit launch permissions.

       Recently deregistered images appear in the returned results for a short
       interval and then return empty results. After all instances that refer-
       ence a deregistered AMI are terminated, specifying the ID of the  image
       will  eventually  return  an error indicating that the AMI ID cannot be
       found.

OPTIONS
       --executable-users (list)
          Scopes the images by users with explicit launch permissions. Specify
          an Amazon Web Services account ID, self (the sender of the request),
          or all (public AMIs).

          o If you specify an Amazon Web Services account ID that is not  your
            own,  only  AMIs  shared  with  that  specific Amazon Web Services
            account ID are returned. However, AMIs that are  shared  with  the
            accounts   organization   or  organizational  unit  (OU)  are  not
            returned.

          o If you specify self or your own Amazon Web  Services  account  ID,
            AMIs shared with your account are returned. In addition, AMIs that
            are shared with the organization or OU of which you are member are
            also returned.

          o If you specify all , all public AMIs are returned.

       --filters (list)
          The filters.

          o architecture - The image architecture (i386 | x86_64 | arm64 ).

          o block-device-mapping.delete-on-termination  - A Boolean value that
            indicates whether the Amazon EBS volume  is  deleted  on  instance
            termination.

          o block-device-mapping.device-name  -  The  device name specified in
            the block device mapping (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh ).

          o block-device-mapping.snapshot-id - The ID of the snapshot used for
            the Amazon EBS volume.

          o block-device-mapping.volume-size  -  The volume size of the Amazon
            EBS volume, in GiB.

          o block-device-mapping.volume-type - The volume type of  the  Amazon
            EBS volume (io1 | io2 | gp2 | gp3 | sc1 | st1 | standard ).

          o block-device-mapping.encrypted  - A Boolean that indicates whether
            the Amazon EBS volume is encrypted.

          o description - The description of the image (provided during  image
            creation).

          o manifest-location - The location of the image manifest.

          o name - The name of the AMI (provided during image creation).

          o owner-alias  -  The  owner  alias (amazon | aws-marketplace ). The
            valid aliases are defined in an Amazon-maintained  list.  This  is
            not  the  Amazon  Web Services account alias that can be set using
            the IAM console. We recommend  that  you  use  the  Owner  request
            parameter instead of this filter.

          o owner-id  -  The  Amazon  Web Services account ID of the owner. We
            recommend that you use the Owner request parameter instead of this
            filter.

          o sriov-net-support - A value of simple indicates that enhanced net-
            working with the Intel 82599 VF interface is enabled.

          o tag  :<key>  -  The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the
            resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value  as
            the  filter  value. For example, to find all resources that have a
            tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA , specify tag:Owner for
            the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

          o tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this fil-
            ter to find all resources assigned a  tag  with  a  specific  key,
            regardless of the tag value.

          o virtualization-type  -  The virtualization type (paravirtual | hvm
            ).

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --image-ids (list)
          The image IDs.

          Default: Describes all images available to you.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --owners (list)
          Scopes the results to images with  the  specified  owners.  You  can
          specify  a  combination  of  Amazon Web Services account IDs, self ,
          amazon , and aws-marketplace .  If  you  omit  this  parameter,  the
          results  include  all  images for which you have launch permissions,
          regardless of ownership.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --include-deprecated | --no-include-deprecated (boolean)
          If true , all deprecated AMIs are included in the response. If false
          ,  no  deprecated  AMIs are included in the response. If no value is
          specified, the default value is false .

          NOTE:
              If you are the AMI owner, all  deprecated  AMIs  appear  in  the
              response  regardless  of the value (true or false ) that you set
              for this parameter.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       User Guide.

       Example 2: To describe AMIs based on filters

       The  following  describe-images example describes Windows AMIs provided
       by Amazon that are backed by Amazon EBS.

          aws ec2 describe-images \
              --owners amazon \
              --filters "Name=platform,Values=windows" "Name=root-device-type,Values=ebs"

       For an example of the output for describe-images, see Example 1.

       For additional examples using filters, see Listing and  filtering  your
       resources in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

       Example 3: To describe AMIs based on tags

       The  following describe-images example describes all AMIs that have the
       tag Type=Custom. The example uses the --query parameter to display only
       the AMI IDs.

          aws ec2 describe-images \
              --filters "Name=tag:Type,Values=Custom" \
              --query 'Images[*].[ImageId]' \
              --output text

       Output:

          ami-1234567890EXAMPLE
          ami-0abcdef1234567890

       For additional examples using tag filters, see Working with tags in the
       Amazon EC2 User Guide.

                 ble for machine images.

              State -> (string)
                 The current state of the AMI. If the state is available , the
                 image is successfully registered and can be used to launch an
                 instance.

              BlockDeviceMappings -> (list)
                 Any block device mapping entries.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a block device mapping, which defines  the  EBS
                     volumes  and  instance  store  volumes  to  attach  to an
                     instance at launch.

                     DeviceName -> (string)
                        The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh ).

                     VirtualName -> (string)
                        The virtual device name (ephemeral N). Instance  store
                        volumes are numbered starting from 0. An instance type
                        with 2 available instance store  volumes  can  specify
                        mappings for ephemeral0 and ephemeral1 . The number of
                        available  instance  store  volumes  depends  on   the
                        instance  type. After you connect to the instance, you
                        must mount the volume.

                        NVMe instance store volumes are automatically  enumer-
                        ated  and  assigned  a  device name. Including them in
                        your block device mapping has no effect.

                        Constraints:  For  M3  instances,  you  must   specify
                        instance store volumes in the block device mapping for
                        the instance. When  you  launch  an  M3  instance,  we
                        ignore  any  instance  store  volumes specified in the
                        block device mapping for the AMI.

                     Ebs -> (structure)
                        Parameters used to automatically set  up  EBS  volumes
                        when the instance is launched.

                        DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                            Indicates  whether  the  EBS  volume is deleted on

                        Iops -> (integer)
                            The number of I/O operations  per  second  (IOPS).
                            For  gp3  , io1 , and io2 volumes, this represents
                            the number of IOPS that are  provisioned  for  the
                            volume. For gp2 volumes, this represents the base-
                            line performance of the volume  and  the  rate  at
                            which  the  volume  accumulates  I/O  credits  for
                            bursting.

                            The following are the supported  values  for  each
                            volume type:

                            o gp3 : 3,000-16,000 IOPS

                            o io1 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                            o io2 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                            For  io1 and io2 volumes, we guarantee 64,000 IOPS
                            only for Instances built on  the  Nitro  System  .
                            Other  instance  families guarantee performance up
                            to 32,000 IOPS.

                            This parameter is required for io1  and  io2  vol-
                            umes.  The  default for gp3 volumes is 3,000 IOPS.
                            This parameter is not supported for gp2  ,  st1  ,
                            sc1 , or standard volumes.

                        SnapshotId -> (string)
                            The ID of the snapshot.

                        VolumeSize -> (integer)
                            The  size of the volume, in GiBs. You must specify
                            either a snapshot ID or  a  volume  size.  If  you
                            specify  a  snapshot,  the default is the snapshot
                            size. You can specify a volume size that is  equal
                            to or larger than the snapshot size.

                            The  following are the supported volumes sizes for
                            each volume type:

                            o gp2 and gp3 :1-16,384

                            o io1 and io2 : 4-16,384

                            o st1 and sc1 : 125-16,384

                            o standard : 1-1,024

                        VolumeType -> (string)
                            The volume type. For more information, see  Amazon
                            EBS volume types in the Amazon EC2 User Guide . If
                            the volume type is io1 or io2 , you  must  specify
                            the IOPS that the volume supports.

                        KmsKeyId -> (string)
                            Identifier  (key  ID,  key alias, ID ARN, or alias
                            ARN) for a customer managed CMK  under  which  the
                            EBS volume is encrypted.

                            This  parameter  is  only  supported  on  BlockDe-
                            viceMapping  objects  called  by  RunInstances   ,
                            RequestSpotFleet , and RequestSpotInstances .

                        Throughput -> (integer)
                            The throughput that the volume supports, in MiB/s.

                            This parameter is valid only for gp3 volumes.

                            Valid Range: Minimum value of 125.  Maximum  value
                            of 1000.

                        OutpostArn -> (string)
                            The  ARN  of  the Outpost on which the snapshot is
                            stored.

                        Encrypted -> (boolean)
                            Indicates whether the encryption state of  an  EBS
                            volume  is  changed  while  being  restored from a
                            backing  snapshot.  The  effect  of  setting   the
                            encryption  state  to  true  depends on the volume
                            origin (new or from a snapshot), starting  encryp-
                            tion  state,  ownership, and whether encryption by
                            default is  enabled.  For  more  information,  see
                            Amazon EBS encryption in the Amazon EC2 User Guide
                            .

                            In no case  can  you  remove  encryption  from  an
                            encrypted volume.

                            Encrypted   volumes   can   only  be  attached  to
                            instances that support Amazon EBS encryption.  For
                            more information, see Supported instance types .
