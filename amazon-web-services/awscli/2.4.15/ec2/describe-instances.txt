DESCRIBE-INSTANCES()                                      DESCRIBE-INSTANCES()



NAME
       describe-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the specified instances or all instances.

       If  you  specify instance IDs, the output includes information for only
       the specified instances. If you specify filters,  the  output  includes
       information  for only those instances that meet the filter criteria. If
       you do not specify instance IDs or filters, the output includes  infor-
       mation  for  all  instances, which can affect performance. We recommend
       that you use pagination to ensure that the  operation  returns  quickly
       and successfully.

       If  you specify an instance ID that is not valid, an error is returned.
       If you specify an instance that you do not own, it is not  included  in
       the output.

       Recently  terminated  instances  might  appear in the returned results.
       This interval is usually less than one hour.

       If you describe instances in the rare case where an  Availability  Zone
       is  experiencing a service disruption and you specify instance IDs that
       are in the affected zone, or do not specify any instance  IDs  at  all,
       the call fails. If you describe instances and specify only instance IDs
       that are in an unaffected zone, the call works normally.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-instances is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Reservations

          o reservation-id  - The ID of the instance's reservation. A reserva-
            tion ID is created any time you launch an instance. A  reservation
            ID  has a one-to-one relationship with an instance launch request,
            but can be associated with more than one instance  if  you  launch
            multiple  instances using the same launch request. For example, if
            you launch one instance, you get one reservation ID. If you launch
            ten  instances  using  the  same  launch request, you also get one
            reservation ID.

          o root-device-name - The device name of the root device volume  (for
            example, /dev/sda1 ).

            instance-store ).

          o source-dest-check  -  Indicates  whether  the  instance   performs
            source/destination  checking.  A value of true means that checking
            is enabled, and false means that checking is disabled.  The  value
            must be false for the instance to perform network address transla-
            tion (NAT) in your VPC.

          o spot-instance-request-id - The ID of the Spot Instance request.

          o state-reason-code - The reason code for the state change.

          o state-reason-message - A message that describes the state  change.

          o subnet-id - The ID of the subnet for the instance.

          o tag:<key>  -  The  key/value  combination of a tag assigned to the
            resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value  as
            the  filter  value. For example, to find all resources that have a
            tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA , specify tag:Owner for
            the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

          o tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this fil-
            ter to find all resources that have a tag  with  a  specific  key,
            regardless of the tag value.

          o tenancy  -  The tenancy of an instance (dedicated | default | host
            ).

          o virtualization-type - The  virtualization  type  of  the  instance
            (paravirtual | hvm ).

          o vpc-id - The ID of the VPC that the instance is running in.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --instance-ids (list)
          The instance IDs.

          Default: Describes all your instances.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       Example 2: To filter for instances with the specified type

       The following describe-instances example  uses  filters  to  scope  the
       results to instances of the specified type.

          aws ec2 describe-instances \
              --filters Name=instance-type,Values=m5.large

       For sample of output, see Example 1.

       For  more information, see Describing instances in a placement group in
       the Amazon EC2 Users Guide.

       Example 3: To filter for instances with the specified type  and  Avail-
       ability Zone

       The following describe-instances example uses multiple filters to scope
       the results to instances with the specified type that are also  in  the
       specified Availability Zone.

          aws ec2 describe-instances \
              --filters Name=instance-type,Values=t2.micro,t3.micro Name=availability-zone,Values=us-east-2c

       the Amazon EC2 Users Guide.

       Example 4: To filter for instances with the specified type  and  Avail-
       ability Zone using a JSON file

       The following describe-instances example uses a JSON input file to per-
       form the same filtering as the previous example. When filters get  more
       complicated, they can be easier to specify in a JSON file.

          aws ec2 describe-instances \
              --filters file://filters.json

       Contents of filters.json:

          [
              {
                  "Name": "instance-type",
                  "Values": ["t2.micro", "t3.micro"]
              },
              {
                  "Name": "availability-zone",
                  "Values": ["us-east-2c"]
              }
          ]

       For sample of output, see Example 1.

       the Amazon EC2 Users Guide.

       Example 5: To filter for instances with the specified Owner tag

       The following describe-instances example uses tag filters to scope  the
       results  to  instances  that  have  a  tag  with  the specified tag key
       (Owner), regardless of the tag value.

          aws ec2 describe-instances \
              --filters "Name=tag-key,Values=Owner"

       For sample of output, see Example 1.

       For more information, see Describing instances in a placement group  in
       the Amazon EC2 Users Guide.

       Example 6: To filter for instances with the specified my-team tag value

       The following describe-instances example uses tag filters to scope  the
       results  to  instances  that  have  a  tag with the specified tag value
       (my-team), regardless of the tag key.

          aws ec2 describe-instances \
              --filters "Name=tag-value,Values=my-team"

       For sample of output, see Example 1.

       For more information, see Describing instances in a placement group  in
       the Amazon EC2 Users Guide.

       Example  7:  To  filter  for instances with the specified Owner tag and
       my-team value

       The following describe-instances example uses tag filters to scope  the
       results to instances that have the specified tag (Owner=my-team).

          aws ec2 describe-instances \
              --filters "Name=tag:Owner,Values=my-team"

       For sample of output, see Example 1.

                            integer.

                            The  high  byte is all of the bits between 2^8 and
                            (2^16)-1, which equals decimal values between  256
                            and  65,535.  These  numerical values are used for
                            internal purposes and should be ignored.

                            The low byte is all of the bits  between  2^0  and
                            (2^8)-1, which equals decimal values between 0 and
                            255.

                            The valid values for instance-state-code will  all
                            be in the range of the low byte and they are:

                            o 0 : pending

                            o 16 : running

                            o 64 : stopping

                            o 80 : stopped

                            You  can ignore the high byte value by zeroing out
                            all of the bits above 2^8 or 256 in decimal.

                        Name -> (string)

                            preferences. Possible preferences include:

                            o open - The instance can run in any open Capacity
                              Reservation   that   has   matching   attributes
                              (instance type, platform, Availability Zone).

                            o none - The instance avoids running in a Capacity
                              Reservation  even  if  one  is  available.   The
                              instance runs in On-Demand capacity.

                               pending   -  The  metadata  options  are  being
                               updated  and  the  instance  is  not  ready  to
                               process  metadata  traffic  with the new selec-
                               tion.

                               applied - The metadata options have  been  suc-
                               cessfully applied on the instance.

                            data requests.

                            If the state is  optional  ,  you  can  choose  to
                            retrieve  instance  metadata  with  or  without  a
                            signed  token  header  on  your  request.  If  you
                            retrieve the IAM role credentials without a token,
                            the version 1.0 role credentials are returned.  If
                            you  retrieve  the  IAM  role  credentials using a
                            valid signed token, the version 2.0  role  creden-
                            tials are returned.

                            If  the state is required , you must send a signed
                            token header with any instance metadata  retrieval
                            requests.  In  this state, retrieving the IAM role
                            credential always returns the version 2.0  creden-
                            tials;  the version 1.0 credentials are not avail-
                            able.

                            Default: optional

                            The  desired  HTTP  PUT  response  hop  limit  for
                            instance metadata requests. The larger the number,
                            the further instance metadata requests can travel.

                            Default: 1

                            Possible values: Integers from 1 to 64
