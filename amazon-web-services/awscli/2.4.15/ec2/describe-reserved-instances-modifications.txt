NAME
       describe-reserved-instances-modifications -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  modifications  made  to  your Reserved Instances. If no
       parameter is specified, information about all your  Reserved  Instances
       modification  requests  is returned. If a modification ID is specified,
       only information about the specific modification is returned.

       For more information, see Modifying Reserved Instances  in  the  Amazon
       EC2 User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-reserved-instances-modifications  is  a  paginated  operation.
       Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the  entire  data
       set  of results. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-pagi-
       nate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on  a
       paginated  response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the
       results of the following query expressions:  ReservedInstancesModifica-
       tions

SYNOPSIS
            describe-reserved-instances-modifications
          [--filters <value>]
          [--reserved-instances-modification-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)

          o modification-result.reserved-instances-id  -  The   ID   for   the
            Reserved  Instances  created  as part of the modification request.
            This ID is only available when the status of the  modification  is
            fulfilled .

          o modification-result.target-configuration.availability-zone  -  The
            Availability Zone for the new Reserved Instances.

            ber of new Reserved Instances.

          o modification-result.target-configuration.instance-type    -    The
            instance type of the new Reserved Instances.

          o modification-result.target-configuration.platform  -  The  network
            platform of the new Reserved Instances (EC2-Classic | EC2-VPC ).

          o reserved-instances-id - The ID of the Reserved Instances modified.

          o reserved-instances-modification-id - The ID  of  the  modification
            request.

          o status - The status of the Reserved Instances modification request
            (processing | fulfilled | failed ).

          o status-message - The reason for the status.

          o update-date - The time when  the  modification  request  was  last
            updated.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --reserved-instances-modification-ids (list)
          IDs for the submitted modification request.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
