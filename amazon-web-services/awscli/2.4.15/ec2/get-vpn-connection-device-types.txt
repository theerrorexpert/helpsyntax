NAME
       get-vpn-connection-device-types -

DESCRIPTION
       Obtain  a  list of customer gateway devices for which sample configura-
       tion files can be provided. The request has no  additional  parameters.
       You  can  also  see  the list of device types with sample configuration
       files available under Your customer gateway device in  the  Amazon  Web
       Services Site-to-Site VPN User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-vpn-connection-device-types  is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: VpnConnectionDeviceTypes

SYNOPSIS
            get-vpn-connection-device-types
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       VpnConnectionDeviceTypes -> (list)
          List of customer gateway devices that have  a  sample  configuration
          file available for use.

          (structure)
              List  of  customer gateway devices that have a sample configura-
              tion file available for use. You can also see the list of device
              types  with sample configuration files available under Your cus-
              tomer gateway device in the Amazon Web Services Site-to-Site VPN
              User Guide .

              VpnConnectionDeviceTypeId -> (string)
                 Customer gateway device identifier.

              Vendor -> (string)
                 Customer gateway device vendor.

              Platform -> (string)
                 Customer gateway device platform.

              Software -> (string)
                 Customer gateway device software version.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  NextToken  value to include in a future GetVpnConnectionDevice-
          Types request. When the  results  of  a  GetVpnConnectionDeviceTypes
          request  exceed  MaxResults , this value can be used to retrieve the
          next page of results. This value is null  when  there  are  no  more
          results to return.
