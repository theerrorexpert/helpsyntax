DEREGISTER-IMAGE()                                          DEREGISTER-IMAGE()



NAME
       deregister-image -

DESCRIPTION
       Deregisters the specified AMI. After you deregister an AMI, it can't be
       used to launch new instances; however, it doesn't affect any  instances
       that  you've  already  launched  from the AMI. You'll continue to incur
       usage costs for those instances until you terminate them.

       When you deregister an Amazon EBS-backed AMI,  it  doesn't  affect  the
       snapshot  that  was  created for the root volume of the instance during
       the AMI creation process. When you deregister an instance  store-backed
       AMI,  it  doesn't  affect the files that you uploaded to Amazon S3 when
       you created the AMI.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            deregister-image
          --image-id <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --image-id (string)
          The ID of the AMI.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       This example deregisters the specified AMI. If the command succeeds, no
       output is returned.

       Command:

          aws ec2 deregister-image --image-id ami-4fa54026

                                                            DEREGISTER-IMAGE()
