RUN-INSTANCES()                                                RUN-INSTANCES()



NAME
       run-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Launches  the  specified number of instances using an AMI for which you
       have permissions.

       You can specify a number of options, or leave the default options.  The
       following rules apply:

       o [EC2-VPC]  If you don't specify a subnet ID, we choose a default sub-
         net from your default VPC for you. If you don't have a  default  VPC,
         you must specify a subnet ID in the request.

       o [EC2-Classic]  If  don't  specify an Availability Zone, we choose one
         for you.

       o Some instance types must be launched into a VPC. If you do not have a
         default VPC, or if you do not specify a subnet ID, the request fails.
         For more information, see Instance types available only in a VPC .

       o [EC2-VPC] All instances have a network interface with a primary  pri-
         vate  IPv4  address. If you don't specify this address, we choose one
         from the IPv4 range of your subnet.

       o Not all instance types support IPv6 addresses. For more  information,
         see Instance types .

       o If you don't specify a security group ID, we use the default security
         group. For more information, see Security groups .

       o If any of the AMIs have a product code attached for  which  the  user
         has not subscribed, the request fails.

       You  can  create  a launch template , which is a resource that contains
       the parameters to launch an instance. When you launch an instance using
       RunInstances  , you can specify the launch template instead of specify-
       ing the launch parameters.

       To ensure faster  instance  launches,  break  up  large  requests  into
       smaller  batches. For example, create five separate launch requests for
       100 instances each instead of one launch request for 500 instances.

       An instance is ready for you to use when it's in the running state. You
       can check the state of your instance using  DescribeInstances . You can
       tag instances and EBS volumes during launch, after launch, or both. For
       more information, see  CreateTags and Tagging your Amazon EC2 resources
       .

       Linux instances have access to the public key of the key pair at  boot.
       You  can  use this key to provide secure access to the instance. Amazon
       EC2 public images use this feature to  provide  secure  access  without
       passwords. For more information, see Key pairs .

       For  troubleshooting,  see What to do if an instance immediately termi-
       nates , and Troubleshooting connecting to your instance .

OPTIONS
       --block-device-mappings (list)
          The block device mapping, which defines the EBS volumes and instance
          store volumes to attach to the instance at launch. For more informa-
          tion, see Block device mappings in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

          (structure)
              Describes a block device mapping, which defines the EBS  volumes
              and instance store volumes to attach to an instance at launch.

              DeviceName -> (string)
                 The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh ).

              VirtualName -> (string)
                 The virtual device name (ephemeral N). Instance store volumes
                 are numbered starting from 0. An instance type with 2  avail-
                 able   instance   store  volumes  can  specify  mappings  for
                 ephemeral0 and ephemeral1 . The number of available  instance
                 store volumes depends on the instance type. After you connect
                 to the instance, you must mount the volume.

                 NVMe instance store volumes are automatically enumerated  and
                 assigned  a  device name. Including them in your block device
                 mapping has no effect.

                 Constraints: For M3  instances,  you  must  specify  instance
                 store  volumes  in the block device mapping for the instance.
                 When you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance  store
                 volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI.

              Ebs -> (structure)
                 Parameters  used to automatically set up EBS volumes when the
                 instance is launched.

                 DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted  on  instance
                     termination.  For more information, see Preserving Amazon
                     EBS volumes on instance termination  in  the  Amazon  EC2
                     User Guide .

                 Iops -> (integer)
                     The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For gp3 ,
                     io1 , and io2 volumes, this represents the number of IOPS
                     that  are  provisioned  for  the volume. For gp2 volumes,
                     this represents the baseline performance  of  the  volume
                     and  the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits
                     for bursting.

                     The following are the supported values  for  each  volume
                     type:

                     o gp3 : 3,000-16,000 IOPS

                     o io1 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                     o io2 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                     For  io1  and  io2 volumes, we guarantee 64,000 IOPS only
                     for Instances built on the Nitro System . Other  instance
                     families guarantee performance up to 32,000 IOPS.

                     This  parameter  is required for io1 and io2 volumes. The
                     default for gp3 volumes is 3,000 IOPS. This parameter  is
                     not  supported for gp2 , st1 , sc1 , or standard volumes.

                 SnapshotId -> (string)
                     The ID of the snapshot.

                 VolumeSize -> (integer)
                     The size of the volume, in GiBs. You must specify  either
                     a  snapshot  ID  or a volume size. If you specify a snap-
                     shot, the default is the snapshot size. You can specify a
                     volume  size that is equal to or larger than the snapshot
                     size.

                     The following are the supported volumes  sizes  for  each
                     volume type:

                     o gp2 and gp3 :1-16,384

                     o io1 and io2 : 4-16,384

                     o st1 and sc1 : 125-16,384

                     o standard : 1-1,024

                 VolumeType -> (string)
                     The  volume  type.  For  more information, see Amazon EBS
                     volume types in the Amazon EC2 User Guide . If the volume
                     type  is  io1 or io2 , you must specify the IOPS that the
                     volume supports.

                 KmsKeyId -> (string)
                     Identifier (key ID, key alias, ID ARN, or alias ARN)  for
                     a  customer  managed  CMK  under  which the EBS volume is
                     encrypted.

                     This parameter is only  supported  on  BlockDeviceMapping
                     objects  called  by RunInstances , RequestSpotFleet , and
                     RequestSpotInstances .

                 Throughput -> (integer)
                     The throughput that the volume supports, in MiB/s.

                     This parameter is valid only for gp3 volumes.

                     Valid Range: Minimum value of 125. Maximum value of 1000.

                 OutpostArn -> (string)
                     The ARN of the Outpost on which the snapshot is stored.

                 Encrypted -> (boolean)
                     Indicates  whether  the encryption state of an EBS volume
                     is changed while being restored from a backing  snapshot.
                     The  effect  of  setting  the  encryption  state  to true
                     depends on the volume origin (new or  from  a  snapshot),
                     starting encryption state, ownership, and whether encryp-
                     tion by default is enabled.  For  more  information,  see
                     Amazon EBS encryption in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

                     In  no  case  can you remove encryption from an encrypted
                     volume.

                     Encrypted volumes can only be attached to instances  that
                     support  Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see
                     Supported instance types .

                     This parameter is not returned by .

              NoDevice -> (string)
                 To omit the device from the block device mapping, specify  an
                 empty  string. When this property is specified, the device is
                 removed from the  block  device  mapping  regardless  of  the
                 assigned value.

       --ipv6-address-count (integer)
          [EC2-VPC] The number of IPv6 addresses to associate with the primary
          network interface. Amazon EC2 chooses the IPv6  addresses  from  the
          range  of your subnet. You cannot specify this option and the option
          to assign specific IPv6 addresses in the same request. You can spec-
          ify this option if you've specified a minimum number of instances to
          launch.

          You cannot specify this option and the network interfaces option  in
          the same request.

       --ipv6-addresses (list)
          [EC2-VPC]  The  IPv6 addresses from the range of the subnet to asso-
          ciate with the primary network interface. You  cannot  specify  this
          option  and  the  option to assign a number of IPv6 addresses in the
          same request. You cannot specify this option if you've  specified  a
          minimum number of instances to launch.

          You  cannot specify this option and the network interfaces option in
          the same request.

          (structure)
              Describes an IPv6 address.

              Ipv6Address -> (string)
                 The IPv6 address.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Ipv6Address=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Ipv6Address": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --kernel-id (string)
          The ID of the kernel.

          WARNING:
              We recommend that you use PV-GRUB instead  of  kernels  and  RAM
              disks.  For more information, see PV-GRUB in the Amazon EC2 User
              Guide .

       --key-name (string)
          The name  of  the  key  pair.  You  can  create  a  key  pair  using
          CreateKeyPair or ImportKeyPair .

          WARNING:
              If  you  do  not  specify  a  key pair, you can't connect to the
              instance unless you choose an AMI that is  configured  to  allow
              users another way to log in.

       --monitoring (structure)
          Specifies whether detailed monitoring is enabled for the instance.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Indicates  whether  detailed  monitoring  is enabled. Otherwise,
              basic monitoring is enabled.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Enabled=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Enabled": true|false

       --placement (structure)
          The placement for the instance.

          AvailabilityZone -> (string)
              The Availability Zone of the instance.

              If not specified, an Availability  Zone  will  be  automatically
              chosen  for  you  based  on  the load balancing criteria for the
              Region.

              This parameter is not supported by CreateFleet .

          Affinity -> (string)
              The affinity setting for the instance  on  the  Dedicated  Host.
              This  parameter is not supported for the ImportInstance command.

              This parameter is not supported by CreateFleet .

          GroupName -> (string)
              The name of the placement group the instance is in.

          PartitionNumber -> (integer)
              The number of the partition that the instance is in. Valid  only
              if the placement group strategy is set to partition .

              This parameter is not supported by CreateFleet .

          HostId -> (string)
              The ID of the Dedicated Host on which the instance resides. This
              parameter is not supported for the ImportInstance command.

              This parameter is not supported by CreateFleet .

          Tenancy -> (string)
              The tenancy of the instance (if the instance  is  running  in  a
              VPC).  An  instance  with  a  tenancy  of dedicated runs on sin-
              gle-tenant hardware. The host tenancy is not supported  for  the
              ImportInstance command.

              This parameter is not supported by CreateFleet .

              T3  instances  that  use  the unlimited CPU credit option do not
              support host tenancy.

          SpreadDomain -> (string)
              Reserved for future use.

              This parameter is not supported by CreateFleet .

          HostResourceGroupArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the host  resource  group  in  which  to  launch  the
              instances.  If  you  specify a host resource group ARN, omit the
              Tenancy parameter or set it to host .

              This parameter is not supported by CreateFleet .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          about whether you need  to  specify  a  RAM  disk.  To  find  kernel
          requirements,  go  to  the  Amazon  Web Services Resource Center and
          search for the kernel ID.

          WARNING:
              We recommend that you use PV-GRUB instead  of  kernels  and  RAM
              disks.  For more information, see PV-GRUB in the Amazon EC2 User
              Guide .

              If  the  state is optional , you can choose to retrieve instance
              metadata with or without a signed token header on your  request.
              If  you  retrieve  the IAM role credentials without a token, the
              version 1.0 role credentials are returned. If you  retrieve  the
              IAM role credentials using a valid signed token, the version 2.0
              role credentials are returned.

              If the state is required , you must send a signed  token  header
              with  any  instance  metadata retrieval requests. In this state,
              retrieving the IAM role credentials always returns  the  version
              2.0  credentials; the version 1.0 credentials are not available.

          provided in the form min:max then the first number is interpreted as
          the  minimum  number of instances to launch and the second is inter-
          preted as the maximum number of instances to launch.

       --secondary-private-ip-addresses (string) [EC2-VPC] A secondary private
       IP  address for the network interface or instance. You can specify this
       multiple times to assign multiple secondary IP addresses. If  you  want
       additional private IP addresses but do not need a specific address, use

       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To launch an instance into a default subnet

       Example 2: To launch an instance into a non-default subnet  and  add  a
       public IP address

       The following run-instances example requests a public IP address for an
       instance that you're launching into a nondefault subnet.  The  instance
       is associated with the specified security group.

          aws ec2 run-instances \
              --image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 \
              --instance-type t2.micro \
              --subnet-id subnet-08fc749671b2d077c \
              --security-group-ids sg-0b0384b66d7d692f9 \
              --associate-public-ip-address \
              --key-name MyKeyPair

       For an example of the output for run-instances, see Example 1.

       Example 3: To launch an instance with additional volumes

       The following run-instances example uses a block device mapping, speci-
       fied in mapping.json, to attach additional volumes at launch.  A  block
       device mapping can specify EBS volumes, instance store volumes, or both
       EBS volumes and instance store volumes.

          aws ec2 run-instances \
              --image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 \
              --instance-type t2.micro \
              --subnet-id subnet-08fc749671b2d077c \
              --security-group-ids sg-0b0384b66d7d692f9 \
              --key-name MyKeyPair \
              --block-device-mappings file://mapping.json

       Contents of mapping.json. This example adds /dev/sdh an empty EBS  vol-
       ume with a size of 100 GiB.

          [
              {
                  "DeviceName": "/dev/sdh",
                  "Ebs": {
                      "VolumeSize": 100
                  }
              }
          ]

       Contents  of  mapping.json. This example adds ephemeral1 as an instance
       store volume.

          [
              {
                  "DeviceName": "/dev/sdc",
                  "VirtualName": "ephemeral1"
              }
          ]

       For an example of the output for run-instances, see Example 1.

       For more information about block device mappings, see Block device map-
       ping in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

       Example 4: To launch an instance and add tags on creation

       The  following run-instances example adds a tag with a key of webserver
       and value of production to the instance. The command also applies a tag
       with a key of cost-center and a value of cc123 to any EBS volume that's
       created (in this case, the root volume).

          aws ec2 run-instances \
              --image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 \
              --instance-type t2.micro \
              --count 1 \
              --subnet-id subnet-08fc749671b2d077c \
              --key-name MyKeyPair \
              --security-group-ids sg-0b0384b66d7d692f9 \
              --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=instance,Tags=[{Key=webserver,Value=production}]' 'ResourceType=volume,Tags=[{Key=cost-center,Value=cc123}]'

       For an example of the output for run-instances, see Example 1.

       Example 5: To launch an instance with user data

       The following run-instances example passes user data in a  file  called
       my_script.txt  that  contains a configuration script for your instance.
       The script runs at launch.

          aws ec2 run-instances \
              --image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 \
              --instance-type t2.micro \
              --count 1 \
              --subnet-id subnet-08fc749671b2d077c \
              --key-name MyKeyPair \
              --security-group-ids sg-0b0384b66d7d692f9 \
              --user-data file://my_script.txt

       For an example of the output for run-instances, see Example 1.

       For more  information  about  instance  user  data,  see  Working  with
       instance user data in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

       Example 6: To launch a burstable performance instance

       The  following  run-instances example launches a t2.micro instance with
       the unlimited credit option. When you launch a T2 instance, if  you  do
       not  specify --credit-specification, the default is the standard credit
       option. When you launch a T3 instance, the  default  is  the  unlimited
       credit option.

          aws ec2 run-instances \
              --image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 \
              --instance-type t2.micro \
              --count 1 \
              --subnet-id subnet-08fc749671b2d077c \
              --key-name MyKeyPair \
              --security-group-ids sg-0b0384b66d7d692f9 \
              --credit-specification CpuCredits=unlimited

       For an example of the output for run-instances, see Example 1.

       For   more  information  about  burstable  performance  instances,  see
       Burstable performance instances in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

                 Code -> (integer)
                     The state of the instance as a 16-bit unsigned integer.

                     The high  byte  is  all  of  the  bits  between  2^8  and
                     (2^16)-1,  which  equals  decimal  values between 256 and
                     65,535. These numerical values are used for internal pur-
                     poses and should be ignored.

                     The  low byte is all of the bits between 2^0 and (2^8)-1,
                     which equals decimal values between 0 and 255.

                     The valid values for instance-state-code will all  be  in
                     the range of the low byte and they are:

                     o 0 : pending

                     o 16 : running

                     o 32 : shutting-down

                     o 48 : terminated

                     o 64 : stopping

                     o 80 : stopped

                     You  can ignore the high byte value by zeroing out all of
                     the bits above 2^8 or 256 in decimal.
