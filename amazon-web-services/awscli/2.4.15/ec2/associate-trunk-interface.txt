DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This  API  action  is currently in limited preview only . If you are
          interested in using this feature, contact your account manager.

       Associates a branch network interface with a trunk network interface.

       Before you create the  association,  run  the  create-network-interface
       command and set --interface-type to trunk . You must also create a net-
       work interface for each branch network interface that you want to asso-
       ciate with the trunk network interface.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            associate-trunk-interface
          --branch-interface-id <value>
          --trunk-interface-id <value>
          [--vlan-id <value>]
          [--gre-key <value>]
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --branch-interface-id (string)
          The ID of the branch network interface.

       --trunk-interface-id (string)
          The ID of the trunk network interface.

       --vlan-id (integer)
          The ID of the VLAN. This applies to the VLAN protocol.

       --gre-key (integer)
          The application key. This applies to the GRE protocol.

       --client-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive  identifier  that  you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. For more information, see How to  Ensure
          Idempotency .

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       InterfaceAssociation -> (structure)
          Information about the association between the trunk  network  inter-
          face and branch network interface.

          AssociationId -> (string)
              The ID of the association.

          BranchInterfaceId -> (string)
              The ID of the branch network interface.

          TrunkInterfaceId -> (string)
              The ID of the trunk network interface.

          InterfaceProtocol -> (string)
              The interface protocol. Valid values are VLAN and GRE .

          VlanId -> (integer)
              The ID of the VLAN when you use the VLAN protocol.

          GreKey -> (integer)
              The application key when you use the GRE protocol.

          Tags -> (list)
              The tags for the trunk interface association.

              (structure)
                 Describes a tag.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key of the tag.

                     Constraints:  Tag  keys  are  case-sensitive and accept a
                     maximum of 127 Unicode characters.  May  not  begin  with
                     aws: .

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value of the tag.

                     Constraints:  Tag  values are case-sensitive and accept a
                     maximum of 255 Unicode characters.

       ClientToken -> (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you  provide  to  ensure  the
          idempotency  of the request. For more information, see How to Ensure
          Idempotency .
