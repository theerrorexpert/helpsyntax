DESCRIPTION
       Create  an  IPAM. Amazon VCP IP Address Manager (IPAM) is a VPC feature
       that you can use to  automate  your  IP  address  management  workflows
       including   assigning,   tracking,  troubleshooting,  and  auditing  IP
       addresses across Amazon Web Services Regions  and  accounts  throughout
       your Amazon Web Services Organization.

       For  more  information,  see Create an IPAM in the Amazon VPC IPAM User
       Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-ipam
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--description <value>]
          [--operating-regions <value>]
          [--tag-specifications <value>]
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without  actually making the request and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --description (string)
          A description for the IPAM.

       --operating-regions (list)
          The operating Regions for the IPAM. Operating Regions are Amazon Web
          Services Regions where the IPAM is  allowed  to  manage  IP  address
          CIDRs.  IPAM only discovers and monitors resources in the Amazon Web
          Services Regions you select as operating Regions.

          For more information about operating Regions, see Create an IPAM  in
          the Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide .

          (structure)
              Add an operating Region to an IPAM. Operating Regions are Amazon
              Web Services Regions where the IPAM  is  allowed  to  manage  IP
              address CIDRs. IPAM only discovers and monitors resources in the
              Amazon Web Services Regions you select as operating Regions.

              For more information about operating Regions, see Create an IPAM
              in the Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide .

              RegionName -> (string)
                 The name of the operating Region.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RegionName=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [

            ...
          ]

       --tag-specifications (list)
          The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the
          tag key in the filter name and the tag value as  the  filter  value.
          For  example,  to  find  all  resources that have a tag with the key
          Owner and the value TeamA , specify tag:Owner for  the  filter  name
          and TeamA for the filter value.

              ated.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of resource to tag on creation.

              Tags -> (list)

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                        Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept  a
                        maximum  of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin with
                        aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

                        Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and  accept
                        a maximum of 255 Unicode characters.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ResourceType=string,Tags=[{Key=string,Value=string},{Key=string,Value=string}] ...

          [
            {
              "ResourceType": "capacity-reservation"|"client-vpn-endpoint"|"customer-gateway"|"carrier-gateway"|"dedicated-host"|"dhcp-options"|"egress-only-internet-gateway"|"elastic-ip"|"elastic-gpu"|"export-image-task"|"export-instance-task"|"fleet"|"fpga-image"|"host-reservation"|"image"|"import-image-task"|"import-snapshot-task"|"instance"|"instance-event-window"|"internet-gateway"|"ipam"|"ipam-pool"|"ipam-scope"|"ipv4pool-ec2"|"ipv6pool-ec2"|"key-pair"|"launch-template"|"local-gateway"|"local-gateway-route-table"|"local-gateway-virtual-interface"|"local-gateway-virtual-interface-group"|"local-gateway-route-table-vpc-association"|"local-gateway-route-table-virtual-interface-group-association"|"natgateway"|"network-acl"|"network-interface"|"network-insights-analysis"|"network-insights-path"|"network-insights-access-scope"|"network-insights-access-scope-analysis"|"placement-group"|"prefix-list"|"replace-root-volume-task"|"reserved-instances"|"route-table"|"security-group"|"security-group-rule"|"snapshot"|"spot-fleet-request"|"spot-instances-request"|"subnet"|"traffic-mirror-filter"|"traffic-mirror-session"|"traffic-mirror-target"|"transit-gateway"|"transit-gateway-attachment"|"transit-gateway-connect-peer"|"transit-gateway-multicast-domain"|"transit-gateway-route-table"|"volume"|"vpc"|"vpc-endpoint"|"vpc-endpoint-service"|"vpc-peering-connection"|"vpn-connection"|"vpn-gateway"|"vpc-flow-log",
              "Tags": [

              ]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. For more information, see Ensuring Idem-
          potency .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
