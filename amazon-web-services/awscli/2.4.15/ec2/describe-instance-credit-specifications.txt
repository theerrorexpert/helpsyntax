NAME
       describe-instance-credit-specifications -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  credit  option for CPU usage of the specified burstable
       performance instances. The credit options are standard and unlimited  .

       If you do not specify an instance ID, Amazon EC2 returns burstable per-
       formance instances  with  the  unlimited  credit  option,  as  well  as
       instances  that  were previously configured as T2, T3, and T3a with the
       unlimited credit option. For example, if  you  resize  a  T2  instance,
       while  it  is  configured  as unlimited , to an M4 instance, Amazon EC2
       returns the M4 instance.

       If you specify one or more instance IDs, Amazon EC2 returns the  credit
       option  (standard  or unlimited ) of those instances. If you specify an
       instance ID that is not valid, such  as  an  instance  that  is  not  a
       burstable performance instance, an error is returned.

       Recently  terminated  instances  might  appear in the returned results.
       This interval is usually less than one hour.

       If an Availability Zone is experiencing a service  disruption  and  you
       specify  instance  IDs  in  the  affected  zone,  or do not specify any
       instance IDs at all, the call fails. If you specify only  instance  IDs
       in an unaffected zone, the call works normally.

       For more information, see Burstable performance instances in the Amazon
       EC2 User Guide .

       describe-instance-credit-specifications is a paginated operation.  Mul-
       tiple  API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set
       of results. You can disable pagination by providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: InstanceCreditSpecifications

SYNOPSIS
            describe-instance-credit-specifications
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--instance-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --filters (list)
          The filters.

          o instance-id - The ID of the instance.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --instance-ids (list)
          The instance IDs.

          Default: Describes all your instances.

          Constraints: Maximum 1000 explicitly specified instance IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 are standard and unlimited .

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is
          null when there are no more results to return.
