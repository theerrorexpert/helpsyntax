NAME
       disable-fast-snapshot-restores -

DESCRIPTION
       Disables  fast  snapshot  restores  for  the specified snapshots in the
       specified Availability Zones.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disable-fast-snapshot-restores
          --availability-zones <value>
          --source-snapshot-ids <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --availability-zones (list)
          One or more Availability Zones. For example, us-east-2a .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --source-snapshot-ids (list)
          The   IDs   of    one    or    more    snapshots.    For    example,
          snap-1234567890abcdef0 .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To disable fast snapshot restore

       The  following  disable-fast-snapshot-restores  example  disables  fast
       snapshot restore for the specified snapshot in the specified Availabil-
       ity Zone.
