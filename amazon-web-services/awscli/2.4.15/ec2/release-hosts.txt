RELEASE-HOSTS()                                                RELEASE-HOSTS()



NAME
       release-hosts -

DESCRIPTION
       When  you  no  longer want to use an On-Demand Dedicated Host it can be
       released. On-Demand billing is stopped and the host goes into  released
       state.  The  host  ID of Dedicated Hosts that have been released can no
       longer be specified in another request,  for  example,  to  modify  the
       host.  You must stop or terminate all instances on a host before it can
       be released.

       When Dedicated Hosts are released, it may take some time  for  them  to
       stop  counting  toward  your  limit and you may receive capacity errors
       when trying to allocate new Dedicated Hosts. Wait  a  few  minutes  and
       then try again.

       Released hosts still appear in a  DescribeHosts response.

SYNOPSIS
            release-hosts
          --host-ids <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --host-ids (list)
          The IDs of the Dedicated Hosts to release.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
