NAME
       describe-scheduled-instance-availability -

DESCRIPTION
       Finds available schedules that meet the specified criteria.

       You  can  search  for  an  available  schedule no more than 3 months in
       advance. You must meet the minimum required duration of 1,200 hours per
       year.  For  example, the minimum daily schedule is 4 hours, the minimum
       weekly schedule is 24 hours, and the minimum monthly  schedule  is  100
       hours.

       After  you  find a schedule that meets your needs, call  PurchaseSched-
       uledInstances to purchase Scheduled Instances with that schedule.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-scheduled-instance-availability is a paginated operation. Mul-
       tiple  API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set
       of results. You can disable pagination by providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: ScheduledInstanceAvailabilitySet

SYNOPSIS
            describe-scheduled-instance-availability
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--filters <value>]
          --first-slot-start-time-range <value>
          [--max-slot-duration-in-hours <value>]
          [--min-slot-duration-in-hours <value>]
          --recurrence <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --filters (list)
          The filters.

          o availability-zone - The Availability Zone (for example, us-west-2a
            ).

          o instance-type - The instance type (for example, c4.large ).

          o network-platform - The network platform (EC2-Classic or EC2-VPC ).

          o platform - The platform (Linux/UNIX or Windows ).

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --first-slot-start-time-range (structure)
          The time period for the first schedule to start.

          EarliestTime -> (timestamp)
              The earliest date and time, in UTC, for the  Scheduled  Instance
              to start.

          LatestTime -> (timestamp)
              The  latest date and time, in UTC, for the Scheduled Instance to
              start. This value must be later than or equal  to  the  earliest
              date and at most three months in the future.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          EarliestTime=timestamp,LatestTime=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "EarliestTime": timestamp,
            "LatestTime": timestamp
          }

       --max-slot-duration-in-hours (integer)
          The maximum available duration, in hours. This value must be greater
          than MinSlotDurationInHours and less than 1,720.

       --min-slot-duration-in-hours (integer)
          The minimum available duration, in hours. The minimum required dura-
          tion  is 1,200 hours per year. For example, the minimum daily sched-
          ule is 4 hours, the minimum weekly schedule is  24  hours,  and  the
          minimum monthly schedule is 100 hours.

       --recurrence (structure)
          The schedule recurrence.

          Frequency -> (string)
              The frequency (Daily , Weekly , or Monthly ).

          Interval -> (integer)
              The interval quantity. The interval unit depends on the value of
              Frequency . For example, every 2 weeks or every 2 months.

          OccurrenceDays -> (list)
              The days. For a monthly schedule, this is one or  more  days  of
              the  month  (1-31).  For  a weekly schedule, this is one or more
              days of the week (1-7, where 1 is  Sunday).  You  can't  specify
              this  value with a daily schedule. If the occurrence is relative
              to the end of the month, you can specify only a single day.

              (integer)

          OccurrenceRelativeToEnd -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether the occurrence is relative to the end  of  the
              specified  week  or  month.  You can't specify this value with a
              daily schedule.

          OccurrenceUnit -> (string)
              The unit for OccurrenceDays (DayOfWeek  or  DayOfMonth  ).  This
              value is required for a monthly schedule. You can't specify Day-
              OfWeek with a weekly schedule. You can't specify this value with
              a daily schedule.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Frequency=string,Interval=integer,OccurrenceDays=integer,integer,OccurrenceRelativeToEnd=boolean,OccurrenceUnit=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Frequency": "string",
            "Interval": integer,
            "OccurrenceDays": [integer, ...],
            "OccurrenceRelativeToEnd": true|false,
            "OccurrenceUnit": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
