CREATE-CLIENT-VPN-ROUTE()                            CREATE-CLIENT-VPN-ROUTE()



NAME
       create-client-vpn-route -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  a  route  to  a network to a Client VPN endpoint. Each Client VPN
       endpoint has a route table that  describes  the  available  destination
       network  routes.  Each  route in the route table specifies the path for
       trac to specic resources or networks.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-client-vpn-route
          --client-vpn-endpoint-id <value>
          --destination-cidr-block <value>
          --target-vpc-subnet-id <value>
          [--description <value>]
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-vpn-endpoint-id (string)
          The ID of the Client VPN endpoint to which to add the route.

       --destination-cidr-block (string)
          The IPv4 address range, in CIDR notation, of the route  destination.
          For example:

          o To add a route for Internet access, enter 0.0.0.0/0

          o To  add a route for a peered VPC, enter the peered VPC's IPv4 CIDR
            range

          o To add a route for an on-premises network, enter  the  Amazon  Web
            Services Site-to-Site VPN connection's IPv4 CIDR range

          o To add a route for the local network, enter the client CIDR range

       --target-vpc-subnet-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the subnet through which you want to route traffic. The
          specified subnet must be an existing target network  of  the  Client
          VPN endpoint.

          Alternatively, if you're adding a route for the local network, spec-
          ify local .

       --description (string)
          A brief description of the route.

       --client-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you  provide  to  ensure  the
          idempotency  of the request. For more information, see How to ensure
          idempotency .

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a route for a Client VPN endpoint

       The  following  create-client-vpn-route  example  adds  a  route to the
       internet (0.0.0.0/0) for the specified subnet of the  Client  VPN  end-
       point.

          aws ec2 create-client-vpn-route \
              --client-vpn-endpoint-id cvpn-endpoint-123456789123abcde \
              --destination-cidr-block 0.0.0.0/0  \
              --target-vpc-subnet-id subnet-0123456789abcabca

       Output:

          {
              "Status": {
                  "Code": "creating"
              }
          }

       For  more  information,  see Routes in the AWS Client VPN Administrator
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       Status -> (structure)
          The current state of the route.

          Code -> (string)
              The state of the Client VPN endpoint route.

          Message -> (string)
              A message about the status of the Client VPN endpoint route,  if
              applicable.
