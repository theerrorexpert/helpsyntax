SYNOPSIS
            provision-public-ipv4-pool-cidr
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          --ipam-pool-id <value>
          --pool-id <value>
          --netmask-length <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without  actually making the request and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --ipam-pool-id (string)
          The ID of the IPAM pool you would like to use to allocate this CIDR.

       --pool-id (string)
          The ID of the public IPv4 pool you would like to use for this  CIDR.

       --netmask-length (integer)
          The  netmask  length  of  the CIDR you would like to allocate to the
          public IPv4 pool.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PoolId -> (string)
          The ID of the pool that you want to provision the CIDR to.

       PoolAddressRange -> (structure)
          Describes an address range of an IPv4 address pool.

          FirstAddress -> (string)
              The first IP address in the range.

          LastAddress -> (string)
              The last IP address in the range.

          AddressCount -> (integer)
              The number of addresses in the range.

          AvailableAddressCount -> (integer)
              The number of available addresses in the range.
