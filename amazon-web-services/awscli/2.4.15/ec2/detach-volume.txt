DETACH-VOLUME()                                                DETACH-VOLUME()



NAME
       detach-volume -

DESCRIPTION
       Detaches  an EBS volume from an instance. Make sure to unmount any file
       systems on the device within your operating system before detaching the
       volume. Failure to do so can result in the volume becoming stuck in the
       busy state while detaching. If this happens, detachment can be  delayed
       indefinitely until you unmount the volume, force detachment, reboot the
       instance, or all three. If an EBS volume  is  the  root  device  of  an
       instance, it can't be detached while the instance is running. To detach
       the root volume, stop the instance first.

       When a volume with an Amazon Web Services Marketplace product  code  is
       detached  from  an  instance,  the product code is no longer associated
       with the instance.

       For more information, see Detach an Amazon EBS  volume  in  the  Amazon
       Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            detach-volume
          [--device <value>]
          [--force | --no-force]
          [--instance-id <value>]
          --volume-id <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --device (string)
          The device name.

       --force | --no-force (boolean)
          Forces  detachment  if the previous detachment attempt did not occur
          cleanly (for example, logging into an instance, unmounting the  vol-
          ume, and detaching normally). This option can lead to data loss or a
          corrupted file system. Use this option only  as  a  last  resort  to
          detach  a  volume from a failed instance. The instance won't have an
          opportunity to flush file system caches or file system metadata.  If
          you  use  this option, you must perform file system check and repair
          procedures.

       --instance-id (string)
          The ID of the instance. If you are detaching a Multi-Attach  enabled
          volume, you must specify an instance ID.

       --volume-id (string)
          The ID of the volume.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To detach a volume from an instance

       This example command detaches the volume  (vol-049df61146c4d7901)  from
       the instance it is attached to.

       Command:

          aws ec2 detach-volume --volume-id vol-1234567890abcdef0

       Output:

          {
              "AttachTime": "2014-02-27T19:23:06.000Z",
              "InstanceId": "i-1234567890abcdef0",
              "VolumeId": "vol-049df61146c4d7901",
              "State": "detaching",
              "Device": "/dev/sdb"
          }

OUTPUT
       AttachTime -> (timestamp)
          The time stamp when the attachment initiated.

       Device -> (string)
          The device name.

       InstanceId -> (string)
          The ID of the instance.

       State -> (string)
          The attachment state of the volume.

       VolumeId -> (string)
          The ID of the volume.

       DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted on instance termination.
