NAME
       describe-host-reservation-offerings -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  Dedicated  Host reservations that are available to pur-
       chase.

       The results describe all of the Dedicated Host  reservation  offerings,
       including offerings that might not match the instance family and Region
       of your Dedicated Hosts. When purchasing an offering, ensure  that  the
       instance  family  and  Region of the offering matches that of the Dedi-
       cated Hosts with which it is to be  associated.  For  more  information
       about  supported  instance types, see Dedicated Hosts in the Amazon EC2
       User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-host-reservation-offerings is a paginated operation.  Multiple
       API  calls  may  be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: OfferingSet

SYNOPSIS
            describe-host-reservation-offerings
          [--filter <value>]
          [--max-duration <value>]
          [--min-duration <value>]
          [--offering-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filter (list)
          The filters.

          o instance-family  -  The instance family of the offering (for exam-
            ple, m4 ).

          o payment-option - The payment option (NoUpfront | PartialUpfront  |
            AllUpfront ).

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-duration (integer)
          This  is the maximum duration of the reservation to purchase, speci-
          fied  in  seconds.  Reservations  are  available  in  one-year   and
          three-year terms. The number of seconds specified must be the number
          of seconds in a year (365x24x60x60) times one of the supported dura-
          tions (1 or 3). For example, specify 94608000 for three years.

       --min-duration (integer)
          This  is  the minimum duration of the reservation you'd like to pur-
          chase, specified in seconds. Reservations are available in  one-year
          and  three-year  terms.  The number of seconds specified must be the
          number of seconds in a year (365x24x60x60) times  one  of  the  sup-
          ported  durations  (1  or  3). For example, specify 31536000 for one
          year.

       --offering-id (string)
          The ID of the reservation offering.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
