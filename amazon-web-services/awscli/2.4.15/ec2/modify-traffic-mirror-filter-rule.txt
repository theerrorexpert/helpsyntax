          Possible values:

          o ingress

          o egress

       --rule-number (integer)
          The number of the Traffic Mirror rule. This number  must  be  unique
          for  each  Traffic  Mirror  rule in a given direction. The rules are
          processed in ascending order by rule number.

       --rule-action (string)
          The action to assign to the rule.

          Possible values:

          o accept

          o reject

       --destination-port-range (structure)
          The destination ports that are associated with  the  Traffic  Mirror
          rule.

          FromPort -> (integer)
              The first port in the Traffic Mirror port range. This applies to
              the TCP and UDP protocols.

          ToPort -> (integer)
              The last port in the Traffic Mirror port range. This applies  to
              the TCP and UDP protocols.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FromPort=integer,ToPort=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "FromPort": integer,
            "ToPort": integer
          }

       --source-port-range (structure)
          The port range to assign to the Traffic Mirror rule.

          FromPort -> (integer)
              The first port in the Traffic Mirror port range. This applies to
              the TCP and UDP protocols.

          ToPort -> (integer)
              The last port in the Traffic Mirror port range. This applies  to
              the TCP and UDP protocols.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FromPort=integer,ToPort=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "FromPort": integer,
            "ToPort": integer
          }

       --protocol (integer)
          The protocol, for example TCP, to assign to the Traffic Mirror rule.

       --destination-cidr-block (string)
          The destination CIDR block to assign to the Traffic Mirror rule.

       --source-cidr-block (string)
          The source CIDR block to assign to the Traffic Mirror rule.

       --description (string)
          The description to assign to the Traffic Mirror rule.

       --remove-fields (list)
          The properties that you want to remove from the Traffic Mirror  fil-
          ter rule.

          When  you  remove  a property from a Traffic Mirror filter rule, the
          property is set to the default.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            destination-port-range
            source-port-range
            protocol
            description

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To modify a traffic mirror filter rule

       The  following  modify-traffic-mirror-filter-rule  example modifies the
       description of the specified traffic mirror filter rule.

          aws ec2 modify-traffic-mirror-filter-rule \
              --traffic-mirror-filter-rule-id tmfr-0ca76e0e08EXAMPLE \
              --description "TCP Rule"

       Output:

          {
              "TrafficMirrorFilterRule": {
                  "TrafficMirrorFilterRuleId": "tmfr-0ca76e0e08EXAMPLE",
                  "TrafficMirrorFilterId": "tmf-0293f26e86EXAMPLE",
                  "TrafficDirection": "ingress",
                  "RuleNumber": 100,
                  "RuleAction": "accept",
                  "Protocol": 6,
                  "DestinationCidrBlock": "10.0.0.0/24",
                  "SourceCidrBlock": "10.0.0.0/24",
                  "Description": "TCP Rule"
              }
