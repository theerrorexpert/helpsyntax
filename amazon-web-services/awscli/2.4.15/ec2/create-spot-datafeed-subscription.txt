NAME
       create-spot-datafeed-subscription -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  data  feed  for  Spot  Instances, enabling you to view Spot
       Instance usage logs. You can create one data feed per Amazon  Web  Ser-
       vices account. For more information, see Spot Instance data feed in the
       Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-spot-datafeed-subscription
          --bucket <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--prefix <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bucket (string)
          The name of the Amazon S3 bucket in which to store the Spot Instance
          data  feed.  For  more information about bucket names, see Rules for
          bucket naming in the Amazon S3 Developer Guide .

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --prefix (string)
          The prefix for the data feed file names.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a Spot Instance data feed

       The  following create-spot-datafeed-subscription example creates a Spot
       Instance data feed.

          aws ec2 create-spot-datafeed-subscription \
              --bucket my-bucket \
              --prefix spot-data-feed

       Output:

          {
              "SpotDatafeedSubscription": {
                  "Bucket": "my-bucket",
                  "OwnerId": "123456789012",
                  "Prefix": "spot-data-feed",
                  "State": "Active"
              }
          }

       The data feed is stored in the Amazon S3 bucket that you specified. The
       file names for this data feed have the following format.

          my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/spot-data-feed/123456789012.YYYY-MM-DD-HH.n.abcd1234.gz

       For more information, see Spot Instance data feed in the Amazon Elastic
