NAME
       describe-capacity-reservations -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  one  or  more  of  your  Capacity  Reservations. The results
       describe only the Capacity Reservations  in  the  Amazon  Web  Services
       Region that you're currently using.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-capacity-reservations  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: CapacityReservations

OPTIONS
       --capacity-reservation-ids (list)
          The ID of the Capacity Reservation.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          One or more filters.

          o instance-type - The type of instance for which the Capacity Reser-
            vation reserves capacity.

          o owner-id - The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the
            Capacity Reservation.

          o instance-platform - The type of operating  system  for  which  the
            Capacity Reservation reserves capacity.

          o availability-zone - The Availability Zone of the Capacity Reserva-
            tion.

          o tenancy - Indicates the tenancy of  the  Capacity  Reservation.  A
            Capacity  Reservation  can  have one of the following tenancy set-
            tings:

            o default - The Capacity Reservation is created on  hardware  that
              is shared with other Amazon Web Services accounts.

            o dedicated - The Capacity Reservation is created on single-tenant
              hardware that is dedicated  to  a  single  Amazon  Web  Services
              account.

          o outpost-arn  -  The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the Outpost on
            which the Capacity Reservation was created.

          o state - The current state of the Capacity Reservation. A  Capacity
            Reservation can be in one of the following states:

            o active  - The Capacity Reservation is active and the capacity is
              available for your use.

            o expired - The Capacity Reservation expired automatically at  the
              date  and  time specified in your request. The reserved capacity
              is no longer available for your use.

            o cancelled - The Capacity Reservation was cancelled. The reserved
              capacity is no longer available for your use.

            o pending  -  The  Capacity Reservation request was successful but
              the capacity provisioning is still pending.

            o failed - The Capacity Reservation request has failed. A  request
              might  fail  due  to  invalid  request parameters, capacity con-
              straints, or instance limit  constraints.  Failed  requests  are
              retained for 60 minutes.

          o start-date  -  The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation
            was started.

          o end-date - The date and time at  which  the  Capacity  Reservation
            expires.  When a Capacity Reservation expires, the reserved capac-
            ity is released and you can no longer launch  instances  into  it.
            The  Capacity  Reservation's  state  changes  to  expired  when it
            reaches its end date and time.

          o end-date-type - Indicates the way in which the  Capacity  Reserva-
            tion  ends.  A  Capacity Reservation can have one of the following
            end types:

            o unlimited - The Capacity Reservation remains  active  until  you
              explicitly cancel it.

            o limited  -  The  Capacity Reservation expires automatically at a
              specified date and time.

          o instance-match-criteria - Indicates the type of instance  launches
            that the Capacity Reservation accepts. The options include:

            o open  - The Capacity Reservation accepts all instances that have
              matching attributes (instance type, platform,  and  Availability
              Zone).  Instances  that have matching attributes launch into the
              Capacity Reservation automatically without specifying any  addi-
              tional parameters.

            o targeted  - The Capacity Reservation only accepts instances that
              have matching attributes (instance type,  platform,  and  Avail-
              ability  Zone),  and explicitly target the Capacity Reservation.
              This ensures that only permitted instances can use the  reserved
              capacity.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          null when there are no more results to return.

       CapacityReservations -> (list)
          Information about the Capacity Reservations.

          (structure)
              Describes a Capacity Reservation.

              CapacityReservationId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Capacity Reservation.

              OwnerId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of  the  Amazon  Web  Services account that owns the
                 Capacity Reservation.

              CapacityReservationArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Capacity Reservation.

              AvailabilityZoneId -> (string)
                 The Availability Zone ID of the Capacity Reservation.

              InstanceType -> (string)
                 The type of  instance  for  which  the  Capacity  Reservation
                 reserves capacity.

              InstancePlatform -> (string)
                 The  type of operating system for which the Capacity Reserva-
                 tion reserves capacity.

              AvailabilityZone -> (string)
                 The Availability Zone in which the capacity is reserved.

              Tenancy -> (string)
                 Indicates the tenancy of the Capacity Reservation. A Capacity
                 Reservation can have one of the following tenancy settings:

                 o default  -  The Capacity Reservation is created on hardware
                   that is shared with other Amazon Web Services accounts.

                 o dedicated - The Capacity Reservation  is  created  on  sin-
                   gle-tenant  hardware  that  is dedicated to a single Amazon
                   Web Services account.

              TotalInstanceCount -> (integer)
                 The total number of instances for which the Capacity Reserva-
                 tion reserves capacity.

              AvailableInstanceCount -> (integer)
                 The  remaining  capacity.  Indicates  the number of instances
                 that can be launched in the Capacity Reservation.

              EbsOptimized -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the Capacity Reservation supports EBS-opti-
                 mized   instances.   This   optimization  provides  dedicated
                 throughput to Amazon EBS and an optimized configuration stack
                 to  provide  optimal I/O performance. This optimization isn't
                 available with all instance types. Additional  usage  charges
                 apply when using an EBS- optimized instance.

              EphemeralStorage -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the Capacity Reservation supports instances
                 with temporary, block-level storage.

              State -> (string)
                 The current state of the  Capacity  Reservation.  A  Capacity
                 Reservation can be in one of the following states:

                 o active  - The Capacity Reservation is active and the capac-
                   ity is available for your use.

                 o expired - The Capacity Reservation expired automatically at
                   the  date  and time specified in your request. The reserved
                   capacity is no longer available for your use.

                 o cancelled - The Capacity  Reservation  was  cancelled.  The
                   reserved capacity is no longer available for your use.

                 o pending  -  The Capacity Reservation request was successful
                   but the capacity provisioning is still pending.

                 o failed - The Capacity Reservation  request  has  failed.  A
                   request  might  fail  due  to  invalid  request parameters,
                   capacity constraints, or instance limit constraints. Failed
                   requests are retained for 60 minutes.

              StartDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time  at  which  the Capacity Reservation was
                 started.

              EndDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation  expires.
                 When a Capacity Reservation expires, the reserved capacity is
                 released and you can no longer launch instances into it.  The
                 Capacity  Reservation's  state  changes  to  expired  when it
                 reaches its end date and time.

              EndDateType -> (string)
                 Indicates the way in which the Capacity Reservation  ends.  A
                 Capacity Reservation can have one of the following end types:

                 o unlimited - The Capacity Reservation remains  active  until
                   you explicitly cancel it.

                 o limited - The Capacity Reservation expires automatically at
                   a specified date and time.

              InstanceMatchCriteria -> (string)
                 Indicates the type of instance  launches  that  the  Capacity
                 Reservation accepts. The options include:

                 o open  - The Capacity Reservation accepts all instances that
                   have matching  attributes  (instance  type,  platform,  and
                   Availability Zone). Instances that have matching attributes
                   launch into the Capacity Reservation automatically  without
                   specifying any additional parameters.

                 o targeted  - The Capacity Reservation only accepts instances
                   that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and
                   Availability  Zone),  and  explicitly  target  the Capacity
                   Reservation. This ensures that only permitted instances can
                   use the reserved capacity.

              CreateDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date and time at which the Capacity Reservation was cre-
                 ated.

              Tags -> (list)
                 Any tags assigned to the Capacity Reservation.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.
