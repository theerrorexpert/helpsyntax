GET-LAUNCH-TEMPLATE-DATA()                          GET-LAUNCH-TEMPLATE-DATA()



NAME
       get-launch-template-data -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the configuration data of the specified instance. You can use
       this data to create a launch template.

       This action calls on other describe actions to  get  instance  informa-
       tion.  Depending  on your instance configuration, you may need to allow
       the following actions in your IAM policy: DescribeSpotInstanceRequests,
       DescribeInstanceCreditSpecifications,    DescribeVolumes,   DescribeIn-
       stanceAttribute, and DescribeElasticGpus. Or, you can  allow  describe*
       depending on your instance requirements.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-launch-template-data
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          --instance-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --instance-id (string)
          The ID of the instance.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get instance data for a launch template

       This example gets data  about  the  specified  instance  and  uses  the
       --query  option  to  return the contents in LaunchTemplateData. You can
       use the output as a base to create a new launch template or launch tem-
       plate version.

       Command:

          aws ec2 get-launch-template-data --instance-id i-0123d646e8048babc --query 'LaunchTemplateData'

                 If this parameter is set to true , the  instance  is  enabled
                 for  hibernation;  otherwise,  it is not enabled for hiberna-
                 tion.

          MetadataOptions -> (structure)
              The metadata options for the instance. For more information, see
              Instance  metadata  and  user data in the Amazon Elastic Compute
              Cloud User Guide .

                 The state of the metadata option changes.
                     pending - The metadata options are being updated and  the
                     instance  is  not  ready to process metadata traffic with
                     the new selection.

                     applied - The metadata  options  have  been  successfully

                 The state of token usage for your instance metadata requests.
                 If the parameter is not specified in the request, the default
                 state is optional .

                 If  the  state  is  optional  ,  you  can  choose to retrieve
                 instance metadata with or without a signed  token  header  on
                 your  request. If you retrieve the IAM role credentials with-
                 out a token, the version 1.0 role credentials  are  returned.
                 If you retrieve the IAM role credentials using a valid signed
                 token, the version 2.0 role credentials are returned.

                 If the state is required ,  you  must  send  a  signed  token
                 header with any instance metadata retrieval requests. In this
                 state, retrieving the IAM role credentials always returns the
                 version  2.0 credentials; the version 1.0 credentials are not
                 available.

                     If you specify a value of disabled , you will not be able
                     to access your instance metadata.

                 for Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves; otherwise, it is  not
                 enabled for Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves.

          InstanceRequirements -> (structure)
              The attributes for the instance types. When you specify instance
              attributes, Amazon EC2 will identify instance types  with  these
              attributes.

              ExcludedInstanceTypes -> (list)
                 The instance types to exclude. You can use strings  with  one
                 or  more  wild  cards,  represented  by  an asterisk (* ), to
                 exclude an instance type, size, or generation. The  following
                 are examples: m5.8xlarge , c5*.* , m5a.* , r* , *3* .

                 For  example, if you specify c5* ,Amazon EC2 will exclude the
                 entire C5 instance family, which includes  all  C5a  and  C5n

                 typically  the  latest  two  to  three  generations  in  each
                 instance  family. For more information, see Instance types in

                 percentage above the cheapest M, C, or R instance  type  with
                 your  specified  attributes. When Amazon EC2 selects instance
                 types with your attributes, it excludes instance types priced
                 above your threshold.
