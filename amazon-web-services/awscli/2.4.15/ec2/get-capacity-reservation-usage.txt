GET-CAPACITY-RESERVATION-USAGE()              GET-CAPACITY-RESERVATION-USAGE()



NAME
       get-capacity-reservation-usage -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  usage  information  about a Capacity Reservation. If the Capacity
       Reservation is shared, it shows  usage  information  for  the  Capacity
       Reservation  owner  and  each  Amazon Web Services account that is cur-
       rently using the shared capacity. If the Capacity  Reservation  is  not
       shared, it shows only the Capacity Reservation owner's usage.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-capacity-reservation-usage
          --capacity-reservation-id <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --capacity-reservation-id (string)
          The ID of the Capacity Reservation.

       --next-token (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of results to return for the request in a single
          page. The remaining results can be seen by sending  another  request
          with  the  returned nextToken value. This value can be between 5 and
          500. If maxResults is given a larger value than 500, you receive  an
          error.

          Valid range: Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of 1000.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To view capacity reservation usage across AWS accounts

       The following  get-capacity-reservation-usage  example  displays  usage
       information for the specified capacity reservation.

          aws ec2 get-capacity-reservation-usage \
              --capacity-reservation-id cr-1234abcd56EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "CapacityReservationId": "cr-1234abcd56EXAMPLE ",
              "InstanceUsages": [
                  {
                      "UsedInstanceCount": 1,
                      "AccountId": "123456789012"
                  }
              ],
              "AvailableInstanceCount": 4,
              "TotalInstanceCount": 5,
              "State": "active",
              "InstanceType": "t2.medium"
          }

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is
          null when there are no more results to return.

       CapacityReservationId -> (string)
          The ID of the Capacity Reservation.

       InstanceType -> (string)
          The  type  of  instance  for which the Capacity Reservation reserves
          capacity.

       TotalInstanceCount -> (integer)
          The number of instances for which the Capacity Reservation  reserves
          capacity.

       AvailableInstanceCount -> (integer)
          The  remaining  capacity. Indicates the number of instances that can
          be launched in the Capacity Reservation.

       State -> (string)
          The current state of the Capacity Reservation. A  Capacity  Reserva-
          tion can be in one of the following states:

          o active  -  The  Capacity Reservation is active and the capacity is
            available for your use.

          o expired - The Capacity Reservation expired  automatically  at  the
            date  and time specified in your request. The reserved capacity is
            no longer available for your use.

          o cancelled - The Capacity Reservation was cancelled.  The  reserved
            capacity is no longer available for your use.

          o pending  - The Capacity Reservation request was successful but the
            capacity provisioning is still pending.

          o failed - The Capacity Reservation request has  failed.  A  request
            might  fail  due  to  invalid  request  parameters,  capacity con-
            straints, or  instance  limit  constraints.  Failed  requests  are
            retained for 60 minutes.

       InstanceUsages -> (list)
          Information about the Capacity Reservation usage.

          (structure)
              Information about the Capacity Reservation usage.

              AccountId -> (string)
                 The  ID of the Amazon Web Services account that is making use
                 of the Capacity Reservation.

              UsedInstanceCount -> (integer)
                 The number of instances the Amazon Web Services account  cur-
                 rently has in the Capacity Reservation.
