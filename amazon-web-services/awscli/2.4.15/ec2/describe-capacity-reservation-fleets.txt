NAME
       describe-capacity-reservation-fleets -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes one or more Capacity Reservation Fleets.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-capacity-reservation-fleets is a paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: CapacityReservationFleets

SYNOPSIS
            describe-capacity-reservation-fleets
          [--capacity-reservation-fleet-ids <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --capacity-reservation-fleet-ids (list)
          The IDs of the Capacity Reservation Fleets to describe.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          One or more filters.

          o state - The state of the Fleet (submitted | modifying |  active  |
            partially_fulfilled  | expiring | expired | cancelling | cancelled
            | failed ).

          o instance-match-criteria - The instance matching criteria  for  the
            Fleet. Only open is supported.

          o tenancy - The tenancy of the Fleet (default | dedicated ).

          o allocation-strategy  -  The allocation strategy used by the Fleet.
            Only prioritized is supported.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              State -> (string)
                 The state of the Capacity Reservation Fleet. Possible  states
                 include:

                 o submitted - The Capacity Reservation Fleet request has been
                   submitted and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud is preparing  to
                   create the Capacity Reservations.

                 o modifying  -  The Capacity Reservation Fleet is being modi-
                   fied. The Fleet remains in this state until  the  modifica-
                   tion is complete.

                 o active  -  The Capacity Reservation Fleet has fulfilled its
                   total target capacity and it is attempting to maintain this
                   capacity. The Fleet remains in this state until it is modi-
                   fied or deleted.

                 o partially_fulfilled - The Capacity  Reservation  Fleet  has
                   partially  fulfilled  its  total  target capacity. There is
                   insufficient Amazon EC2 to fulfill the total target  capac-
                   ity.  The Fleet is attempting to asynchronously fulfill its
                   total target capacity.

                 o expiring - The Capacity Reservation Fleet has reach its end
                   date  and  it is in the process of expiring. One or more of
                   its Capacity reservations might still be active.

                 o expired - The Capacity Reservation Fleet has reach its  end
                   date.  The Fleet and its Capacity Reservations are expired.
                   The Fleet can't create new Capacity Reservations.

                 o cancelling - The  Capacity  Reservation  Fleet  is  in  the
                   process  of  being  cancelled.  One or more of its Capacity
                   reservations might still be active.

                 o cancelled - The Capacity Reservation Fleet has  been  manu-
                   ally cancelled. The Fleet and its Capacity Reservations are
                   cancelled and the Fleet can't create new Capacity  Reserva-
                   tions.

                 o failed  -  The Capacity Reservation Fleet failed to reserve
                   capacity for the specified instance types.

              TotalTargetCapacity -> (integer)
                 The total number of capacity units  for  which  the  Capacity
                 Reservation  Fleet  reserves  capacity. For more information,
                 see Total target capacity in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

              TotalFulfilledCapacity -> (double)
                 The capacity units that have been fulfilled.

              Tenancy -> (string)
                 The tenancy of  the  Capacity  Reservation  Fleet.  Tenancies
                 include:

                 o default  -  The  Capacity  Reservation  Fleet is created on
                   hardware that is shared  with  other  Amazon  Web  Services
                   accounts.

                 o dedicated  -  The  Capacity Reservation Fleet is created on
                   single-tenant hardware that is dedicated to a single Amazon
                   Web Services account.

              EndDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time  at which the Capacity Reservation Fleet
                 expires.

              CreateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation Fleet was
                 created.

              InstanceMatchCriteria -> (string)
                 Indicates  the  type  of  instance launches that the Capacity
                 Reservation Fleet accepts. All Capacity Reservations  in  the
                 Fleet inherit this instance matching criteria.

                 Currently,  Capacity Reservation Fleets support open instance
                 matching criteria only. This means that instances  that  have
                 matching  attributes (instance type, platform, and Availabil-
                 ity Zone) run in  the  Capacity  Reservations  automatically.
                 Instances  do not need to explicitly target a Capacity Reser-
                 vation Fleet to use its reserved capacity.

              AllocationStrategy -> (string)
                 The strategy used by the Capacity Reservation Fleet to deter-
                 mine  which  of the specified instance types to use. For more
                 information, see For more information, see Allocation  strat-
                 egy in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

              InstanceTypeSpecifications -> (list)
                 Information about the instance types for which to reserve the
                 capacity.
