NAME
       terminate-client-vpn-connections -

DESCRIPTION
       Terminates  active  Client VPN endpoint connections. This action can be
       used to terminate a specific client connection, or up to  five  connec-
       tions established by a specific user.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            terminate-client-vpn-connections
          --client-vpn-endpoint-id <value>
          [--connection-id <value>]
          [--username <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-vpn-endpoint-id (string)
          The  ID of the Client VPN endpoint to which the client is connected.

       --connection-id (string)
          The ID of the client connection to be terminated.

       --username (string)
          The name of the user who initiated the connection. Use  this  option
          to  terminate  all  active  connections for the specified user. This
          option can only be used if the user has established up to five  con-
          nections.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To terminate a connection to a Client VPN endpoint

       The following terminate-client-vpn-connections example  terminates  the
       specified connection to the Client VPN endpoint.

          aws ec2 terminate-client-vpn-connections \
              --client-vpn-endpoint-id vpn-endpoint-123456789123abcde \
              --connection-id cvpn-connection-04edd76f5201e0cb8

       Output:

          {
              "ClientVpnEndpointId": "vpn-endpoint-123456789123abcde",
              "ConnectionStatuses": [
                  {
                      "ConnectionId": "cvpn-connection-04edd76f5201e0cb8",
                      "PreviousStatus": {
                          "Code": "active"
                      },
                      "CurrentStatus": {
                          "Code": "terminating"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }
