NAME
       describe-network-insights-analyses -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes one or more of your network insights analyses.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-network-insights-analyses  is  a paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: NetworkInsightsAnalyses

SYNOPSIS
            describe-network-insights-analyses
          [--network-insights-analysis-ids <value>]
          [--network-insights-path-id <value>]
          [--analysis-start-time <value>]
          [--analysis-end-time <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --network-insights-analysis-ids (list)
          The ID of the network insights analyses.  You  must  specify  either
          analysis IDs or a path ID.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --network-insights-path-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the path. You must specify either a path ID or analysis
          IDs.

       --analysis-start-time (timestamp)
          The time when the network insights analyses started.

       --analysis-end-time (timestamp)
          The time when the network insights analyses ended.

       --filters (list)
          The filters. The following are possible values:

          o PathFound - A Boolean value that indicates whether a feasible path
            is found.

          o Status  -  The  status  of  the  analysis  (running  | succeeded |
            failed).

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To view the results of a path analysis

       The following describe-network-insights-analyses example describes  the
       specified analysis. In this example, the source is an internet gateway,
       the destination is an EC2 instance, and the protocol is TCP. The analy-
       sis succeeded (Status is succeeded) and the path is not reachable (Net-
       workPathFound is false).  The  explanation  code  ENI_SG_RULES_MISMATCH
       indicates  that  the security group for the instance does not contain a
       rule that allows traffic on the destination port.
