CREATE-DEFAULT-VPC()                                      CREATE-DEFAULT-VPC()



NAME
       create-default-vpc -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  default  VPC  with a size /16 IPv4 CIDR block and a default
       subnet in each Availability Zone. For more information about the compo-
       nents of a default VPC, see Default VPC and default subnets in the Ama-
       zon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide . You cannot  specify  the  compo-
       nents of the default VPC yourself.

       If you deleted your previous default VPC, you can create a default VPC.
       You cannot have more than one default VPC per Region.

       If your account supports EC2-Classic, you cannot  use  this  action  to
       create a default VPC in a Region that supports EC2-Classic. If you want
       a default VPC in a Region that supports EC2-Classic, see "I really want
       a  default  VPC  for my existing EC2 account. Is that possible?" in the
       Default VPCs FAQ .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-default-vpc
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
