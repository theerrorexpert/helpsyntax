MODIFY-IPAM-RESOURCE-CIDR()                        MODIFY-IPAM-RESOURCE-CIDR()



NAME
       modify-ipam-resource-cidr -

DESCRIPTION
       Modify  a  resource  CIDR. You can use this action to transfer resource
       CIDRs between scopes and ignore resource CIDRs that you do not want  to
       manage.  If set to false, the resource will not be tracked for overlap,
       it cannot be auto-imported into a pool, and it will be removed from any
       pool it has an allocation in.

       For more information, see Move resource CIDRs between scopes and Change
       the monitoring state of resource CIDRs in  the  Amazon  VPC  IPAM  User
       Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-ipam-resource-cidr
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          --resource-id <value>
          --resource-cidr <value>
          --resource-region <value>
          --current-ipam-scope-id <value>
          [--destination-ipam-scope-id <value>]
          --monitored | --no-monitored
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without actually making the request and provides an error  response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --resource-id (string)
          The ID of the resource you want to modify.

       --resource-cidr (string)
          The CIDR of the resource you want to modify.

       --resource-region (string)
          The Amazon Web Services Region of the resource you want to modify.

       --current-ipam-scope-id (string)
          The ID of the current scope that the resource CIDR is in.

       --destination-ipam-scope-id (string)
          The ID of the scope you want to transfer the resource CIDR to.

       --monitored | --no-monitored (boolean)
          Determines if the resource is monitored by IPAM. If  a  resource  is
          monitored,  the  resource  is  discovered  by  IPAM and you can view
          details about the resources CIDR.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To modify the CIDR allocated to a resource

       The following modify-ipam-resource-cidr  example  modifies  a  resource
       CIDR.

       (Linux):

          aws ec2 modify-ipam-resource-cidr \
              --current-ipam-scope-id ipam-scope-02fc38cd4c48e7d38 \
              --destination-ipam-scope-id ipam-scope-0da34c61fd189a141 \
              --resource-id vpc-010e1791024eb0af9 \
              --resource-cidr 10.0.1.0/24 \
              --resource-region us-east-1 \
              --monitored

       (Windows):

          aws ec2 modify-ipam-resource-cidr ^
              --current-ipam-scope-id ipam-scope-02fc38cd4c48e7d38 ^
              --destination-ipam-scope-id ipam-scope-0da34c61fd189a141 ^
              --resource-id vpc-010e1791024eb0af9 ^
              --resource-cidr 10.0.1.0/24 ^
              --resource-region us-east-1 ^
              --monitored

       Output:

              The ID of an IPAM resource.

          ResourceName -> (string)
              The name of an IPAM resource.

          ResourceCidr -> (string)
              The CIDR for an IPAM resource.

                 The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the  resource.
                 Use  the  tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the
                 filter value. For example, to find all resources that have  a
                 tag  with  the  key  Owner  and  the  value  TeamA  , specify
                 tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

                     The  key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this fil-
                     ter to find all resources assigned a tag with a  specific
                     key, regardless of the tag value.

              Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide .

          OverlapStatus -> (string)
              The overlap status of an IPAM resource. The overlap status tells
              you if the CIDR for a resource overlaps with another CIDR in the
