CREATE-SNAPSHOT()                                            CREATE-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       create-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a snapshot of an EBS volume and stores it in Amazon S3. You can
       use snapshots for backups, to make copies of EBS volumes, and  to  save
       data before shutting down an instance.

       You  can create snapshots of volumes in a Region and volumes on an Out-
       post. If you create a snapshot of a volume in a  Region,  the  snapshot
       must  be stored in the same Region as the volume. If you create a snap-
       shot of a volume on an Outpost, the snapshot can be stored on the  same
       Outpost as the volume, or in the Region for that Outpost.

       When a snapshot is created, any Amazon Web Services Marketplace product
       codes that are associated with the source volume are propagated to  the
       snapshot.

       You  can take a snapshot of an attached volume that is in use. However,
       snapshots only capture data that has been written to  your  Amazon  EBS
       volume  at  the time the snapshot command is issued; this might exclude
       any data that has been cached by any applications or the operating sys-
       tem.  If  you  can  pause any file systems on the volume long enough to
       take a snapshot, your snapshot should be complete. However, if you can-
       not  pause all file writes to the volume, you should unmount the volume
       from within the instance, issue the snapshot command, and then  remount
       the  volume  to  ensure  a  consistent  and  complete snapshot. You may
       remount and use your volume while the snapshot status is pending .

       To create a snapshot for Amazon EBS volumes that serve as root devices,
       you should stop the instance before taking the snapshot.

       Snapshots  that  are  taken  from  encrypted  volumes are automatically
       encrypted. Volumes that are created from encrypted snapshots  are  also
       automatically  encrypted.  Your  encrypted  volumes  and any associated
       snapshots always remain protected.

       You can tag your snapshots during creation. For more  information,  see
       Tag  your Amazon EC2 resources in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User
       Guide .

       For more information, see Amazon Elastic Block  Store  and  Amazon  EBS
       encryption in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

              ]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a snapshot

       This  example command creates a snapshot of the volume with a volume ID
       of vol-1234567890abcdef0 and a short description to identify the  snap-
       shot.

       Command:

          aws ec2 create-snapshot --volume-id vol-1234567890abcdef0 --description "This is my root volume snapshot"

       Output:

          {
              "Description": "This is my root volume snapshot",
              "Tags": [],
              "Encrypted": false,
              "VolumeId": "vol-1234567890abcdef0",
              "State": "pending",
              "VolumeSize": 8,
              "StartTime": "2018-02-28T21:06:01.000Z",
              "Progress": "",
              "OwnerId": "012345678910",
              "SnapshotId": "snap-066877671789bd71b"
          }

       To create a snapshot with tags

       This  example  command  creates  a  snapshot and applies two tags: pur-
       pose=prod and costcenter=123.

       Command:

          aws ec2 create-snapshot --volume-id vol-1234567890abcdef0 --description 'Prod backup' --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=snapshot,Tags=[{Key=purpose,Value=prod},{Key=costcenter,Value=123}]'

       Output:

          {
              "Description": "Prod backup",
              "Tags": [
                  {
                      "Value": "prod",
                      "Key": "purpose"
                  },
                  {
                      "Value": "123",
                      "Key": "costcenter"
                  }
               ],
               "Encrypted": false,
               "VolumeId": "vol-1234567890abcdef0",
               "State": "pending",
               "VolumeSize": 8,
               "StartTime": "2018-02-28T21:06:06.000Z",
               "Progress": "",
               "OwnerId": "012345678910",
               "SnapshotId": "snap-09ed24a70bc19bbe4"
           }

OUTPUT
       DataEncryptionKeyId -> (string)
          The data encryption key identifier for the snapshot. This value is a
          unique  identifier  that corresponds to the data encryption key that
          was used to encrypt the original volume or  snapshot  copy.  Because
          data  encryption  keys  are  inherited by volumes created from snap-
          shots, and vice versa, if snapshots share the same  data  encryption
          key  identifier,  then  they belong to the same volume/snapshot lin-
          eage. This parameter is only returned by  DescribeSnapshots .

       Description -> (string)
          The description for the snapshot.

       Encrypted -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether the snapshot is encrypted.

       KmsKeyId -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Key Management  Service  (KMS)
          KMS  key  that was used to protect the volume encryption key for the
          parent volume.

       OwnerId -> (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns  the  EBS  snap-
          shot.

       Progress -> (string)
          The progress of the snapshot, as a percentage.

       SnapshotId -> (string)
          The  ID  of the snapshot. Each snapshot receives a unique identifier
          when it is created.

       StartTime -> (timestamp)
          The time stamp when the snapshot was initiated.

       State -> (string)
          The snapshot state.

       StateMessage -> (string)
          Encrypted Amazon EBS snapshots are copied asynchronously. If a snap-
          shot copy operation fails (for example, if the proper Key Management
          Service (KMS) permissions are  not  obtained)  this  field  displays
          error  state  details  to  help you diagnose why the error occurred.
          This parameter is only returned by  DescribeSnapshots .

       VolumeId -> (string)
          The ID of the volume that was used to create the snapshot. Snapshots
          created by the  CopySnapshot action have an arbitrary volume ID that
          should not be used for any purpose.

       VolumeSize -> (integer)
          The size of the volume, in GiB.

       OwnerAlias -> (string)
          The Amazon Web Services owner alias, from an Amazon-maintained  list
          (amazon  ).  This  is  not  the  user-configured Amazon Web Services
          account alias set using the IAM console.

       OutpostArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the Outpost on which the snapshot  is  stored.  For  more
          information,  see Amazon EBS local snapshots on Outposts in the Ama-
          zon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

       Tags -> (list)
          Any tags assigned to the snapshot.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

                 Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a maximum
                 of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin with aws: .

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

                 Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and accept a maxi-
                 mum of 255 Unicode characters.

       StorageTier -> (string)
          The storage tier in which the snapshot is stored. standard indicates
          that  the  snapshot  is stored in the standard snapshot storage tier
          and that it is ready for use. archive indicates that the snapshot is
          currently  archived  and  that  it must be restored before it can be
          used.

       RestoreExpiryTime -> (timestamp)
          Only for archived snapshots that are temporarily restored. Indicates
          the date and time when a temporarily restored snapshot will be auto-
          matically re-archived.



                                                             CREATE-SNAPSHOT()
