ASSOCIATE-DHCP-OPTIONS()                              ASSOCIATE-DHCP-OPTIONS()



NAME
       associate-dhcp-options -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  a set of DHCP options (that you've previously created) with
       the specified VPC, or associates no DHCP options with the VPC.

       After you associate the options with the VPC,  any  existing  instances
       and  all new instances that you launch in that VPC use the options. You
       don't need to restart or relaunch  the  instances.  They  automatically
       pick up the changes within a few hours, depending on how frequently the
       instance renews its DHCP lease. You  can  explicitly  renew  the  lease
       using the operating system on the instance.

       For  more information, see DHCP options sets in the Amazon Virtual Pri-
       vate Cloud User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            associate-dhcp-options
          --dhcp-options-id <value>
          --vpc-id <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dhcp-options-id (string)
          The ID of the DHCP options set, or  default  to  associate  no  DHCP
          options with the VPC.

       --vpc-id (string)
          The ID of the VPC.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To associate a DHCP options set with your VPC

       This example associates the specified DHCP options set with the  speci-
       fied VPC. If the command succeeds, no output is returned.

       Command:

          aws ec2 associate-dhcp-options --dhcp-options-id dopt-d9070ebb --vpc-id vpc-a01106c2

       To associate the default DHCP options set with your VPC

       This example associates the default DHCP options set with the specified
       VPC. If the command succeeds, no output is returned.

       Command:

          aws ec2 associate-dhcp-options --dhcp-options-id default --vpc-id vpc-a01106c2

OUTPUT
       None
