SYNOPSIS
            disassociate-instance-event-window
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          --instance-event-window-id <value>
          --association-target <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --instance-event-window-id (string)
          The ID of the event window.

       --association-target (structure)
          One or more targets to disassociate from the specified event window.

          InstanceIds -> (list)
              The IDs of the instances to disassociate from the event  window.

              (string)

          InstanceTags -> (list)
              The  instance  tags  to  disassociate from the event window. Any
              instances associated with the tags will  be  disassociated  from
              the event window.

              (structure)
                 Describes a tag.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key of the tag.

                     Constraints:  Tag  keys  are  case-sensitive and accept a
                     maximum of 127 Unicode characters.  May  not  begin  with
                     aws: .

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value of the tag.

                     Constraints:  Tag  values are case-sensitive and accept a
                     maximum of 255 Unicode characters.

          DedicatedHostIds -> (list)
              The IDs of the Dedicated Hosts to disassociate  from  the  event
              window.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          InstanceIds=string,string,InstanceTags=[{Key=string,Value=string},{Key=string,Value=string}],DedicatedHostIds=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "InstanceIds": ["string", ...],
            "InstanceTags": [
              {
                "Key": "string",
                "Value": "string"
              }
              ...
            ],
            "DedicatedHostIds": ["string", ...]
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
