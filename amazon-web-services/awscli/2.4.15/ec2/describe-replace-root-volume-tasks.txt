NAME
       describe-replace-root-volume-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  a  root  volume  replacement task. For more information, see
       Replace a root volume in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide  .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-replace-root-volume-tasks  is  a paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: ReplaceRootVolumeTasks

SYNOPSIS
            describe-replace-root-volume-tasks
          [--replace-root-volume-task-ids <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --replace-root-volume-task-ids (list)
          The ID of the root volume replacement task to view.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          Filter to use:

          o instance-id - The ID of the instance for  which  the  root  volume
            replacement task was created.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ReplaceRootVolumeTasks -> (list)
          Information about the root volume replacement task.

          (structure)
              Information about a root volume replacement task.

              ReplaceRootVolumeTaskId -> (string)
                 The ID of the root volume replacement task.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The  ID of the instance for which the root volume replacement

                 The state of the task. The task can be in one of the  follow-
                 ing states:

                 o pending - the replacement volume is being created.

                 o in-progress - the original volume is being detached and the
                   replacement volume is being attached.

                 o succeeded - the replacement volume  has  been  successfully
                   attached to the instance and the instance is available.

                 o failing  -  the replacement task is in the process of fail-

                 o failed - the replacement task has failed but  the  original
                   root volume is still attached.

                 o failing-detached  -  the replacement task is in the process
                   of  failing.  The  instance  might  have  no  root   volume
                   attached.

                 o failed-detached  -  the replacement task has failed and the
