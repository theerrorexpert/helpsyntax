ALLOCATE-ADDRESS()                                          ALLOCATE-ADDRESS()



NAME
       allocate-address -

DESCRIPTION
       Allocates  an  Elastic  IP address to your Amazon Web Services account.
       After you allocate the Elastic IP address you can associate it with  an
       instance or network interface. After you release an Elastic IP address,
       it is released to the IP address pool and can be allocated to a differ-
       ent Amazon Web Services account.

       You  can  allocate  an Elastic IP address from an address pool owned by
       Amazon Web Services or from an address pool created from a public  IPv4
       address range that you have brought to Amazon Web Services for use with
       your Amazon Web Services resources using bring your  own  IP  addresses
       (BYOIP).  For more information, see Bring Your Own IP Addresses (BYOIP)
       in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

       [EC2-VPC] If you release an Elastic IP address, you might  be  able  to
       recover  it. You cannot recover an Elastic IP address that you released
       after it is allocated to another Amazon Web Services account. You  can-
       not  recover  an  Elastic  IP  address  for  EC2-Classic. To attempt to
       recover an Elastic IP address that you released,  specify  it  in  this
       operation.

       An  Elastic IP address is for use either in the EC2-Classic platform or
       in a VPC. By default, you can  allocate  5  Elastic  IP  addresses  for
       EC2-Classic  per  Region  and  5  Elastic  IP addresses for EC2-VPC per
       Region.

       For more information, see Elastic IP Addresses in  the  Amazon  Elastic
       Compute Cloud User Guide .

       You can allocate a carrier IP address which is a public IP address from
       a telecommunication carrier, to a network interface which resides in  a
       subnet in a Wavelength Zone (for example an EC2 instance).

SYNOPSIS
            allocate-address
          [--domain <value>]
          [--address <value>]
          [--public-ipv4-pool <value>]
          [--network-border-group <value>]
          [--customer-owned-ipv4-pool <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--tag-specifications <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          Indicates  whether  the Elastic IP address is for use with instances
          in a VPC or instances in EC2-Classic.

          Default: If the Region supports EC2-Classic, the default is standard
          . Otherwise, the default is vpc .

          Possible values:

          o vpc

          o standard

       --address (string)
          [EC2-VPC]  The Elastic IP address to recover or an IPv4 address from
          an address pool.

       --public-ipv4-pool (string)
          The ID of an address pool that you own. Use this  parameter  to  let
          Amazon  EC2  select  an  address from the address pool. To specify a
          specific address from the address pool, use  the  Address  parameter
          instead.

       --network-border-group (string)
          A unique set of Availability Zones, Local Zones, or Wavelength Zones
          from which Amazon Web Services advertises  IP  addresses.  Use  this
          parameter  to  limit  the  IP address to this location. IP addresses
          cannot move between network border groups.

          Use DescribeAvailabilityZones to view the network border groups.

          You cannot use a network border  group  with  EC2  Classic.  If  you
          attempt this operation on EC2 Classic, you receive an InvalidParame-
          terCombination error.

       --customer-owned-ipv4-pool (string)
          The ID of a customer-owned address pool. Use this parameter  to  let
          Amazon  EC2  select an address from the address pool. Alternatively,
          specify a specific address from the address pool.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --tag-specifications (list)
          The tags to assign to the Elastic IP address.

          (structure)
              The  tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being cre-
              ated.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of resource to tag on creation.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The tags to apply to the resource.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                        Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept  a
                        maximum  of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin with
                        aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

                        Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and  accept
                        a maximum of 255 Unicode characters.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ResourceType=string,Tags=[{Key=string,Value=string},{Key=string,Value=string}] ...

       JSON Syntax:

            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.
