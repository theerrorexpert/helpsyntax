DISASSOCIATE-CLIENT-VPN-TARGET-NETWORKDISASSOCIATE-CLIENT-VPN-TARGET-NETWORK()



NAME
       disassociate-client-vpn-target-network -

DESCRIPTION
       Disassociates  a target network from the specified Client VPN endpoint.
       When you disassociate the last target network from a  Client  VPN,  the
       following happens:

       o The route that was automatically added for the VPC is deleted

       o All active client connections are terminated

       o New client connections are disallowed

       o The Client VPN endpoint's status changes to pending-associate

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disassociate-client-vpn-target-network
          --client-vpn-endpoint-id <value>
          --association-id <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-vpn-endpoint-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the  Client VPN endpoint from which to disassociate the
          target network.

       --association-id (string)
          The ID of the target network association.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To disassociate a network from a Client VPN endpoint

       The following disassociate-client-vpn-target-network example disassoci-
       ates    the    target    network    that's    associated    with    the
       cvpn-assoc-12312312312312312  association  ID  for the specified Client
       VPN endpoint.

          aws ec2 disassociate-client-vpn-target-network \
              --client-vpn-endpoint-id cvpn-endpoint-123456789123abcde \
              --association-id cvpn-assoc-12312312312312312

       Output:

          {
              "AssociationId": "cvpn-assoc-12312312312312312",
              "Status": {
                  "Code": "disassociating"
              }
          }

       For more information, see Target Networks in the AWS Client VPN  Admin-
       istrator Guide.

OUTPUT
       AssociationId -> (string)
          The ID of the target network association.

       Status -> (structure)
          The current state of the target network association.

          Code -> (string)
              The state of the target network association.

          Message -> (string)
              A message about the status of the target network association, if
              applicable.
