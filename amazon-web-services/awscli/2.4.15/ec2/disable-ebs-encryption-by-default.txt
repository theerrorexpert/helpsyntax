DISABLE-EBS-ENCRYPTION-BY-DEFAULT()        DISABLE-EBS-ENCRYPTION-BY-DEFAULT()



NAME
       disable-ebs-encryption-by-default -

DESCRIPTION
       Disables  EBS  encryption  by  default  for your account in the current
       Region.

       After you disable encryption by default, you can still create encrypted
       volumes by enabling encryption when you create each volume.

       Disabling  encryption  by default does not change the encryption status
       of your existing volumes.

       For more information, see Amazon EBS encryption in the  Amazon  Elastic
       Compute Cloud User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disable-ebs-encryption-by-default
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To disable EBS encryption by default

       The following disable-ebs-encryption-by-default  example  disables  EBS
       encryption by default for your AWS account in the current Region.

          aws ec2 disable-ebs-encryption-by-default

       Output:

          {
              "EbsEncryptionByDefault": false
          }

OUTPUT
       EbsEncryptionByDefault -> (boolean)
          The updated status of encryption by default.
