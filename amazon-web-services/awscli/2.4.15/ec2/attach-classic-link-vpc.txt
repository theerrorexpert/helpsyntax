ATTACH-CLASSIC-LINK-VPC()                            ATTACH-CLASSIC-LINK-VPC()



NAME
       attach-classic-link-vpc -

DESCRIPTION
       Links  an EC2-Classic instance to a ClassicLink-enabled VPC through one
       or more of the VPC's security groups. You cannot  link  an  EC2-Classic
       instance  to more than one VPC at a time. You can only link an instance
       that's in the running state. An instance is automatically unlinked from
       a  VPC  when  it's  stopped - you can link it to the VPC again when you
       restart it.

       After you've linked an instance, you cannot  change  the  VPC  security
       groups  that are associated with it. To change the security groups, you
       must first unlink the instance, and then link it again.

       Linking your instance to a VPC is sometimes referred  to  as  attaching
       your instance.

SYNOPSIS
            attach-classic-link-vpc
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          --groups <value>
          --instance-id <value>
          --vpc-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --groups (list)
          The ID of one or more of the VPC's security groups. You cannot spec-
          ify security groups from a different VPC.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --instance-id (string)
          The ID of an EC2-Classic instance to link to the ClassicLink-enabled
          VPC.

       --vpc-id (string)
          The ID of a ClassicLink-enabled VPC.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To link (attach) an EC2-Classic instance to a VPC

       This example links instance  i-1234567890abcdef0  to  VPC  vpc-88888888
       through the VPC security group sg-12312312.

       Command:

          aws ec2 attach-classic-link-vpc --instance-id  i-1234567890abcdef0 --vpc-id vpc-88888888 --groups sg-12312312

       Output:

          {
            "Return": true
          }

OUTPUT
       Return -> (boolean)
          Returns  true  if  the  request  succeeds;  otherwise, it returns an
          error.
