NAME
       describe-spot-fleet-requests -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes your Spot Fleet requests.

       Spot  Fleet  requests  are deleted 48 hours after they are canceled and
       their instances are terminated.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-spot-fleet-requests is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: SpotFleetRequestConfigs

SYNOPSIS
            describe-spot-fleet-requests
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--spot-fleet-request-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --spot-fleet-request-ids (list)
          The IDs of the Spot Fleet requests.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token  required to retrieve the next set of results. This value
          is null when there are no more results to return.

       SpotFleetRequestConfigs -> (list)
          Information about the configuration of your Spot Fleet.

          (structure)
              Describes a Spot Fleet request.

              ActivityStatus -> (string)
                 The progress of the Spot Fleet request. If there is an error,
                 the status is error . After all requests are placed, the sta-
                 tus is pending_fulfillment . If the  size  of  the  fleet  is
                 equal  to  or greater than its target capacity, the status is
                 fulfilled . If the size of the fleet is decreased, the status
                 is  pending_termination while Spot Instances are terminating.

              CreateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The creation date and time of the request.

              SpotFleetRequestConfig -> (structure)
                 The configuration of the Spot Fleet request.

                 AllocationStrategy -> (string)
                     Indicates how to allocate the target Spot Instance capac-
                     ity  across the Spot Instance pools specified by the Spot
                     Fleet request.

                     If the allocation strategy is lowestPrice  ,  Spot  Fleet
                     launches  instances from the Spot Instance pools with the
                     lowest price. This is the default allocation strategy.

                     If the allocation strategy is diversified  ,  Spot  Fleet
                     launches  instances from all the Spot Instance pools that
                     you specify.

                     If the allocation strategy is  capacityOptimized  (recom-
                     mended), Spot Fleet launches instances from Spot Instance
                     pools with optimal capacity for the number  of  instances
                     that  are  launching.  To  give  certain instance types a
                     higher chance of launching first, use  capacityOptimized-
                     Prioritized  .  Set  a priority for each instance type by
                     using the Priority parameter for  LaunchTemplateOverrides
                     .   You   can  assign  the  same  priority  to  different
                     LaunchTemplateOverrides . EC2 implements  the  priorities
                     on a best-effort basis, but optimizes for capacity first.
                     capacityOptimizedPrioritized is supported  only  if  your
                     Spot Fleet uses a launch template. Note that if the OnDe-
                     mandAllocationStrategy is set to prioritized ,  the  same
                     priority is applied when fulfilling On-Demand capacity.

                 OnDemandAllocationStrategy -> (string)
                     The order of the launch template overrides to use in ful-
                     filling On-Demand capacity. If you specify lowestPrice  ,
                     Spot  Fleet  uses price to determine the order, launching
                     the lowest price first. If you specify prioritized , Spot
                     Fleet  uses  the  priority  that  you assign to each Spot
                     Fleet launch template  override,  launching  the  highest
                     priority first. If you do not specify a value, Spot Fleet
                     defaults to lowestPrice .

                 SpotMaintenanceStrategies -> (structure)
                     The strategies for managing your Spot Instances that  are
                     at an elevated risk of being interrupted.

                     CapacityRebalance -> (structure)
                        The  Spot  Instance  replacement  strategy to use when
                        Amazon EC2 emits a signal that your Spot  Instance  is
                        at  an  elevated  risk  of being interrupted. For more
                        information, see Capacity rebalancing  in  the  Amazon
                        EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances .

                        ReplacementStrategy -> (string)
                            The  replacement  strategy  to use. Only available
                            for fleets of type maintain .
                               launch - Spot Fleet launches a new  replacement
                               Spot  Instance when a rebalance notification is
                               emitted for an existing Spot  Instance  in  the
                               fleet.   Spot  Fleet  does  not  terminate  the
                               instances that receive  a  rebalance  notifica-
                               tion.  You  can terminate the old instances, or
                               you can leave them running. You are charged for
                               all instances while they are running.

                               launch-before-terminate - Spot Fleet launches a
                               new replacement Spot Instance when a  rebalance
                               notification  is  emitted  for an existing Spot
                               Instance in the fleet, and then, after a  delay
                               that you specify (in TerminationDelay ), termi-
                               nates the instances that received  a  rebalance
                               notification.

                        TerminationDelay -> (integer)
                            The  amount  of  time (in seconds) that Amazon EC2
                            waits before terminating  the  old  Spot  Instance
                            after launching a new replacement Spot Instance.

                            Required   when   ReplacementStrategy  is  set  to
                            launch-before-terminate .

                            Not  valid  when  ReplacementStrategy  is  set  to
                            launch .

                            Valid  values: Minimum value of 120 seconds. Maxi-

                     ensure  the  idempotency  of your listings. This helps to
                     avoid  duplicate  listings.  For  more  information,  see
                     Ensuring Idempotency .

                 ExcessCapacityTerminationPolicy -> (string)
                     Indicates whether running Spot Instances should be termi-
                     nated if you decrease the target  capacity  of  the  Spot
                     Fleet request below the current size of the Spot Fleet.

                 FulfilledCapacity -> (double)
                     The number of units fulfilled by this request compared to
                     the set target capacity. You cannot set this value.

                     The number of On-Demand units fulfilled by  this  request
                     compared to the set target On-Demand capacity.

                 IamFleetRole -> (string)
                     The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Identity and Access
                     Management (IAM) role that grants the Spot Fleet the per-
                     mission  to request, launch, terminate, and tag instances
                     on your behalf. For more information, see Spot Fleet pre-
                     requisites  in  the  Amazon  EC2  User  Guide  for  Linux
                     Instances . Spot Fleet can terminate  Spot  Instances  on
                     your  behalf when you cancel its Spot Fleet request using
                     CancelSpotFleetRequests or when the  Spot  Fleet  request
                     expires, if you set TerminateInstancesWithExpiration .

                 LaunchSpecifications -> (list)
                     The  launch specifications for the Spot Fleet request. If
                     you specify  LaunchSpecifications  ,  you  can't  specify
                     LaunchTemplateConfigs . If you include On-Demand capacity
                     in your request, you must use LaunchTemplateConfigs .

                     (structure)
                        Describes the launch specification  for  one  or  more
                        Spot  Instances.  If you include On-Demand capacity in
                        your fleet request or want to specify an  EFA  network
                        device,  you  can't use SpotFleetLaunchSpecification ;
                        you must use LaunchTemplateConfig .

                        SecurityGroups -> (list)
                            One  or  more  security  groups.  When  requesting
                            instances  in  a  VPC, you must specify the IDs of
                            the security groups. When requesting instances  in
                            EC2-Classic,  you can specify the names or the IDs
                            of the security groups.

                            (structure)
                               Describes a security group.

                               GroupName -> (string)
                                   The name of the security group.

                               GroupId -> (string)
                                   The ID of the security group.

                        AddressingType -> (string)
                            Deprecated.

                        BlockDeviceMappings -> (list)
                            One or more block devices that are mapped  to  the
                            Spot  Instances. You can't specify both a snapshot
                            ID and an encryption value. This is  because  only
                            blank  volumes  can be encrypted on creation. If a
                            snapshot is the basis for  a  volume,  it  is  not
                            blank  and  its  encryption status is used for the
                            volume encryption status.

                            (structure)
                               Describes a block device mapping, which defines
                               the  EBS  volumes and instance store volumes to
                               attach to an instance at launch.

                               DeviceName -> (string)
                                   The device name (for example,  /dev/sdh  or
                                   xvdh ).

                               VirtualName -> (string)
                                   The  virtual  device  name  (ephemeral  N).
                                   Instance store volumes are numbered  start-
                                   ing  from 0. An instance type with 2 avail-
                                   able instance  store  volumes  can  specify
                                   mappings  for  ephemeral0  and ephemeral1 .
                                   The number of available instance store vol-
                                   umes  depends  on  the instance type. After
                                   you connect to the instance, you must mount
                                   the volume.

                                   NVMe  instance  store volumes are automati-
                                   cally  enumerated  and  assigned  a  device
                                   name.  Including  them in your block device
                                   mapping has no effect.

                                   Constraints: For  M3  instances,  you  must
                                   specify instance store volumes in the block
                                   device mapping for the instance.  When  you
                                   launch   an  M3  instance,  we  ignore  any
                                   instance store  volumes  specified  in  the
                                   block device mapping for the AMI.

                               Ebs -> (structure)
                                   Parameters used to automatically set up EBS
                                   volumes when the instance is launched.

                                   DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                                      Indicates  whether  the  EBS  volume  is
                                      deleted  on  instance  termination.  For
                                      more information, see Preserving  Amazon
                                      EBS  volumes  on instance termination in
                                      the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

                                   Iops -> (integer)
                                      The number of I/O operations per  second
                                      (IOPS). For gp3 , io1 , and io2 volumes,
                                      this represents the number of IOPS  that
                                      are  provisioned for the volume. For gp2
                                      volumes, this  represents  the  baseline
                                      performance  of  the volume and the rate
                                      at  which  the  volume  accumulates  I/O
                                      credits for bursting.

                                      The  following  are the supported values
                                      for each volume type:

                                      o gp3 : 3,000-16,000 IOPS

                                      o io1 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                                      o io2 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                                      For io1 and io2  volumes,  we  guarantee
                                      64,000  IOPS only for Instances built on
                                      the Nitro System . Other instance  fami-
                                      lies  guarantee performance up to 32,000
                                      IOPS.

                                      This parameter is required for  io1  and
                                      io2 volumes. The default for gp3 volumes
                                      is 3,000 IOPS.  This  parameter  is  not
                                      supported for gp2 , st1 , sc1 , or stan-
                                      dard volumes.

                                   SnapshotId -> (string)
                                      The ID of the snapshot.

                                   VolumeSize -> (integer)
                                      The size of the  volume,  in  GiBs.  You
                                      must  specify  either a snapshot ID or a
                                      volume size. If you specify a  snapshot,
                                      the  default  is  the snapshot size. You
                                      can specify a volume size that is  equal
                                      to or larger than the snapshot size.

                                      The  following are the supported volumes
                                      sizes for each volume type:

                                      o gp2 and gp3 :1-16,384

                                      o io1 and io2 : 4-16,384

                                      o st1 and sc1 : 125-16,384

                                      o standard : 1-1,024

                                   VolumeType -> (string)
                                      The volume type. For  more  information,

                                      zon EC2 User Guide . If the volume  type
                                      is  io1  or  io2  , you must specify the
                                      IOPS that the volume supports.

                                   KmsKeyId -> (string)
                                      Identifier (key ID, key alias,  ID  ARN,
                                      or alias ARN) for a customer managed CMK
                                      under which the EBS volume is encrypted.

                                      This  parameter  is  only  supported  on
                                      BlockDeviceMapping  objects  called   by
                                      RunInstances  ,  RequestSpotFleet  , and
                                      RequestSpotInstances .

                                   Throughput -> (integer)
                                      The throughput that the volume supports,
                                      in MiB/s.

                                      This  parameter  is  valid  only for gp3
                                      volumes.

                                      Valid Range: Minimum value of 125. Maxi-
                                      mum value of 1000.

                                   OutpostArn -> (string)
                                      The  ARN  of  the  Outpost  on which the
                                      snapshot is stored.

                                   Encrypted -> (boolean)
                                      Indicates whether the  encryption  state
                                      of  an EBS volume is changed while being
                                      restored from a  backing  snapshot.  The
                                      effect  of  setting the encryption state
                                      to true depends  on  the  volume  origin
                                      (new   or  from  a  snapshot),  starting
                                      encryption state, ownership, and whether
                                      encryption  by  default  is enabled. For
                                      more information, see Amazon EBS encryp-
                                      tion in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

                                      In  no  case  can  you remove encryption
                                      from an encrypted volume.

                                      Encrypted volumes can only  be  attached
                                      to  instances  that  support  Amazon EBS

                        WeightedCapacity -> (double)
                            The number of  units  provided  by  the  specified
                            instance  type.  These are the same units that you
                            chose to set  the  target  capacity  in  terms  of
                            instances, or a performance characteristic such as
                            vCPUs, memory, or I/O.

                               The  instance  types  to  exclude.  You can use
                               strings with one or  more  wild  cards,  repre-
                               sented  by  an  asterisk  (*  ),  to exclude an
                               instance type, size, or generation. The follow-
                               ing  are examples: m5.8xlarge , c5*.* , m5a.* ,
                               r* , *3* .

                               For example, if you  specify  c5*  ,Amazon  EC2
                               will  exclude  the  entire  C5 instance family,
                               which includes all C5a and C5n instance  types.
                               If  you specify m5a.* , Amazon EC2 will exclude
                               all the M5a instance types,  but  not  the  M5n
                               instance types.

                               Default: No excluded instance types

                               tion instance types are included.  The  current
                               generation  instance  types are recommended for
                               use. Current generation instance types are typ-
                               ically  the  latest two to three generations in
                               each instance family. For more information, see
                               Instance types in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

                               For  current generation instance types, specify

                               Spot  Instance, expressed as a percentage above
                               the cheapest M, C, or R instance type with your
                               specified  attributes.  When Amazon EC2 selects
                               instance  types  with   your   attributes,   it
                               excludes   instance  types  priced  above  your
                               threshold.

                               The parameter accepts an integer, which  Amazon
                               EC2 interprets as a percentage.

                               To  turn  off  price protection, specify a high
                               value, such as 999999 .

                               This   parameter   is   not    supported    for

                               InstanceType -> (string)
                                   The instance type.

                               SpotPrice -> (string)
                                   The maximum price per unit  hour  that  you
                                   are willing to pay for a Spot Instance.

                               SubnetId -> (string)
                                   The ID of the subnet in which to launch the
                                   instances.

                               AvailabilityZone -> (string)
                                   The Availability Zone in  which  to  launch
                                   the instances.

                               WeightedCapacity -> (double)
                                   The  number of units provided by the speci-
                                   fied instance type.

                               Priority -> (double)
                                   The priority for the launch template  over-
                                   ride.  The  highest  priority  is  launched
                                   first.

                                   If  OnDemandAllocationStrategy  is  set  to
                                   prioritized  ,  Spot Fleet uses priority to
                                   determine which launch template override to
                                   use first in fulfilling On-Demand capacity.

                                   If the Spot AllocationStrategy  is  set  to
                                   capacityOptimizedPrioritized  ,  Spot Fleet
                                   uses priority on  a  best-effort  basis  to
                                   determine which launch template override to
                                   use in fulfilling Spot capacity, but  opti-
                                   mizes for capacity first.

                                   Valid  values are whole numbers starting at
                                   0 . The lower the number,  the  higher  the
                                   priority.  If  no number is set, the launch
                                   template override has the lowest  priority.
                                   You can set the same priority for different
                                   launch template overrides.

                               InstanceRequirements -> (structure)
                                   The instance requirements. When you specify
                                   instance   requirements,  Amazon  EC2  will
                                   identify instance types with  the  provided
                                   requirements,  and  then use your On-Demand
                                   and Spot allocation  strategies  to  launch
                                   instances from these instance types, in the
                                   same way as when  you  specify  a  list  of
                                   instance types.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If  you  specify  InstanceRequirements ,
                                      you can't specify InstanceTypes .

                                   VCpuCount -> (structure)
                                      The minimum and maximum number of vCPUs.

                                      Min -> (integer)
                                          The  minimum number of vCPUs. If the
                                          value is 0 ,  there  is  no  minimum
                                          limit.

                                      Max -> (integer)
                                          The maximum number of vCPUs. If this
                                          parameter is not specified, there is
                                          no maximum limit.

                                   MemoryMiB -> (structure)
                                      The  minimum  and maximum amount of mem-
                                      ory, in MiB.

                                          The minimum  amount  of  memory,  in
                                          MiB. If this parameter is not speci-
                                          fied, there is no minimum limit.

                                      Max -> (integer)
                                          The maximum  amount  of  memory,  in
                                          MiB. If this parameter is not speci-
                                          fied, there is no maximum limit.

                                   CpuManufacturers -> (list)
                                      The CPU manufacturers to include.

                                      o For instance types  with  Intel  CPUs,
                                        specify intel .

                                      o For  instance  types  with  AMD  CPUs,
                                        specify amd .

                                      o For instance  types  with  Amazon  Web
                                        Services CPUs, specify amazon-web-ser-
                                        vices .

                                      NOTE:
                                          Don't confuse the  CPU  manufacturer
                                          with the CPU architecture. Instances
                                          will be launched with  a  compatible
                                          CPU architecture based on the Amazon
                                          Machine Image (AMI) that you specify
                                          in your launch template.

                                      Default: Any manufacturer

                                      (string)

                                   MemoryGiBPerVCpu -> (structure)
                                      The minimum and maximum amount of memory
                                      per vCPU, in GiB.

                                      Default: No minimum or maximum limits

                                      Min -> (double)
                                          The minimum  amount  of  memory  per
                                          vCPU,  in  GiB. If this parameter is
                                          not specified, there is  no  minimum
                                          limit.

                                      Max -> (double)
                                          The  maximum  amount  of  memory per
                                          vCPU, in GiB. If this  parameter  is
                                          not  specified,  there is no maximum
                                          limit.

                                   ExcludedInstanceTypes -> (list)
                                      The instance types to exclude.  You  can
                                      use strings with one or more wild cards,
                                      represented by  an  asterisk  (*  ),  to
                                      exclude  an instance type, size, or gen-
                                      eration.  The  following  are  examples:
                                      m5.8xlarge  , c5*.* , m5a.* , r* , *3* .

                                      For example, if you specify c5*  ,Amazon
                                      EC2  will exclude the entire C5 instance
                                      family, which includes all C5a  and  C5n
                                      instance  types.  If you specify m5a.* ,
                                      Amazon EC2  will  exclude  all  the  M5a
                                      instance types, but not the M5n instance
                                      types.

                                      Default: No excluded instance types

                                      (string)

                                   InstanceGenerations -> (list)
                                      Indicates whether  current  or  previous
                                      generation  instance types are included.
                                      The current  generation  instance  types
                                      are recommended for use. Current genera-
                                      tion instance types  are  typically  the
                                      latest  two to three generations in each
                                      instance family. For  more  information,
                                      see  Instance  types  in  the Amazon EC2
                                      User Guide .

                                      For current generation  instance  types,
                                      specify current .

                                      For  previous generation instance types,
                                      specify previous .

                                      Default: Current and previous generation
                                      instance types

                                      (string)

                                   SpotMaxPricePercentageOverLowestPrice    ->
                                   (integer)
                                      The price protection threshold for  Spot
                                      Instances. This is the maximum youll pay
                                      for a Spot Instance, expressed as a per-
                                      centage  above  the  cheapest M, C, or R
                                      instance  type   with   your   specified
                                      attributes.   When  Amazon  EC2  selects
                                      instance types with your attributes,  it
                                      excludes  instance  types  priced  above
                                      your threshold.

                                      The parameter accepts an integer,  which
                                      Amazon EC2 interprets as a percentage.

                                      To  turn off price protection, specify a
                                      high value, such as 999999 .

                                      This  parameter  is  not  supported  for
                                      GetSpotPlacementScores               and

                                   -> (integer)
                                      The  price  protection   threshold   for
                                      On-Demand Instances. This is the maximum
                                      youll pay  for  an  On-Demand  Instance,
                                      expressed  as  a  percentage  above  the
                                      cheapest M, C, or R instance  type  with
                                      your  specified  attributes. When Amazon
                                      EC2 selects  instance  types  with  your
                                      attributes,  it  excludes instance types
                                      priced above your threshold.

                                      The parameter accepts an integer,  which
                                      Amazon EC2 interprets as a percentage.

                                      To  turn off price protection, specify a
                                      high value, such as 999999 .

                                      This  parameter  is  not  supported  for

                     The maximum price per unit hour that you are  willing  to
                     pay  for  a  Spot  Instance. The default is the On-Demand
                     price.

                 TargetCapacity -> (integer)
                     The number of units to request for the  Spot  Fleet.  You
                     can  choose  to  set  the  target  capacity  in  terms of
                     instances or a performance characteristic that is  impor-
                     tant to your application workload, such as vCPUs, memory,
                     or I/O. If the request type is maintain , you can specify
                     a target capacity of 0 and add capacity later.

                 OnDemandTargetCapacity -> (integer)
                     The  number of On-Demand units to request. You can choose
                     to set the target capacity in terms  of  instances  or  a
                     performance  characteristic  that  is  important  to your
                     application workload, such as vCPUs, memory, or  I/O.  If
                     the  request  type is maintain , you can specify a target
                     capacity of 0 and add capacity later.

                 OnDemandMaxTotalPrice -> (string)
                     The maximum amount per hour for On-Demand Instances  that
                     you're  willing to pay. You can use the onDemandMaxTotal-
                     Price parameter, the spotMaxTotalPrice parameter, or both
                     parameters to ensure that your fleet cost does not exceed
                     your budget. If you set a maximum price per hour for  the
                     On-Demand  Instances  and Spot Instances in your request,
                     Spot Fleet will launch instances  until  it  reaches  the
                     maximum  amount  you're  willing to pay. When the maximum
                     amount you're willing to pay is reached, the fleet  stops
                     launching  instances  even  if  it  hasnt  met the target
                     capacity.

                 SpotMaxTotalPrice -> (string)
                     The maximum amount  per  hour  for  Spot  Instances  that
                     you're willing to pay. You can use the spotdMaxTotalPrice
                     parameter, the onDemandMaxTotalPrice parameter,  or  both
                     parameters to ensure that your fleet cost does not exceed
                     your budget. If you set a maximum price per hour for  the
                     On-Demand  Instances  and Spot Instances in your request,
                     Spot Fleet will launch instances  until  it  reaches  the
                     maximum  amount  you're  willing to pay. When the maximum
                     amount you're willing to pay is reached, the fleet  stops
                     launching  instances  even  if  it  hasnt  met the target
                     capacity.

                 TerminateInstancesWithExpiration -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether running Spot Instances  are  terminated
                     when the Spot Fleet request expires.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The  type  of  request.  Indicates whether the Spot Fleet
                     only requests the target capacity  or  also  attempts  to
                     maintain  it. When this value is request , the Spot Fleet
                     only places the required requests. It does not attempt to
                     replenish  Spot  Instances if capacity is diminished, nor
                     does it submit requests  in  alternative  Spot  pools  if
                     capacity  is not available. When this value is maintain ,
                     the Spot Fleet maintains the target  capacity.  The  Spot
                     Fleet  places  the required requests to meet capacity and
                     automatically  replenishes  any  interrupted   instances.
                     Default:  maintain . instant is listed but is not used by
                     Spot Fleet.

                     The start date and time of the  request,  in  UTC  format
                     (YYYY  -MM  -DD  T*HH* :MM :SS Z). By default, Amazon EC2
                     starts fulfilling the request immediately.

                 ValidUntil -> (timestamp)
                     The end date and time of the request, in UTC format (YYYY
                     -MM -DD T*HH* :MM :SS Z). After the end date and time, no
                     new Spot Instance requests are placed or able to  fulfill
                     the  request.  If  no  value is specified, the Spot Fleet
                     request remains until you cancel it.

                 ReplaceUnhealthyInstances -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether Spot  Fleet  should  replace  unhealthy
                     instances.

                 InstanceInterruptionBehavior -> (string)
                     The  behavior  when  a  Spot Instance is interrupted. The
                     default is terminate .

                 LoadBalancersConfig -> (structure)
                     One or more Classic Load Balancers and target  groups  to
                     attach  to  the  Spot Fleet request. Spot Fleet registers
                     the running Spot Instances  with  the  specified  Classic
                     Load Balancers and target groups.

                     With  Network  Load Balancers, Spot Fleet cannot register
                     instances that have the  following  instance  types:  C1,
                     CC1,  CC2,  CG1, CG2, CR1, CS1, G1, G2, HI1, HS1, M1, M2,
                     M3, and T1.

                     ClassicLoadBalancersConfig -> (structure)

                        ClassicLoadBalancers -> (list)
                            One or more Classic Load Balancers.

                            (structure)
                               Describes a Classic Load Balancer.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the load balancer.

                     TargetGroupsConfig -> (structure)
                        The target groups.

                        TargetGroups -> (list)
                            One or more target groups.

                            (structure)
                               Describes a load balancer target group.

                               Arn -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  tar-
                                   get group.

                 InstancePoolsToUseCount -> (integer)
                     The  number  of  Spot pools across which to allocate your
                     target Spot capacity. Valid only  when  Spot  Allocation-
                     Strategy  is set to lowest-price . Spot Fleet selects the
                     cheapest Spot pools and evenly allocates your target Spot
                     capacity  across  the number of Spot pools that you spec-
                     ify.

                     Note that Spot Fleet attempts to draw Spot Instances from
                     the  number  of  pools  that you specify on a best effort
                     basis. If a pool runs out of Spot  capacity  before  ful-
                     filling your target capacity, Spot Fleet will continue to
                     fulfill your request by drawing from  the  next  cheapest
                     pool.  To  ensure  that  your target capacity is met, you
                     might receive Spot Instances from more than the number of
                     pools that you specified. Similarly, if most of the pools
                     have no Spot capacity, you might receive your full target
                     capacity  from  fewer  than  the number of pools that you
                     specified.

                 Context -> (string)
                     Reserved.

                 TargetCapacityUnitType -> (string)
                     The unit for the target capacity.

                     Default: units (translates to number of instances)

                 TagSpecifications -> (list)
                     The key-value pair for tagging the Spot Fleet request  on
                     creation.    The   value   for   ResourceType   must   be
                     spot-fleet-request , otherwise  the  Spot  Fleet  request
                     fails.  To  tag  instances at launch, specify the tags in
                     the launch template (valid only  if  you  use  LaunchTem-
                     plateConfigs  )  or  in  the  ` SpotFleetTagSpecification
