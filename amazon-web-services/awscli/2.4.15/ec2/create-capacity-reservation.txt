CREATE-CAPACITY-RESERVATION()                    CREATE-CAPACITY-RESERVATION()



NAME
       create-capacity-reservation -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new Capacity Reservation with the specified attributes.

       Capacity  Reservations  enable  you to reserve capacity for your Amazon
       EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone for  any  duration.  This
       gives  you the flexibility to selectively add capacity reservations and
       still get the Regional RI discounts for that usage. By creating  Capac-
       ity  Reservations, you ensure that you always have access to Amazon EC2
       capacity when you need it, for as long as you need it. For more  infor-
       mation, see Capacity Reservations in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

       Your  request to create a Capacity Reservation could fail if Amazon EC2
       does not have sufficient capacity  to  fulfill  the  request.  If  your
       request  fails due to Amazon EC2 capacity constraints, either try again
       at a later time, try in a different Availability  Zone,  or  request  a
       smaller  capacity  reservation.  If your application is flexible across
       instance types and sizes, try to create  a  Capacity  Reservation  with
       different instance attributes.

       Your  request  could  also  fail if the requested quantity exceeds your
       On-Demand Instance limit  for  the  selected  instance  type.  If  your
       request  fails  due  to  limit  constraints,  increase  your  On-Demand
       Instance limit for the required instance type and try again.  For  more
       information  about increasing your instance limits, see Amazon EC2 Ser-
       vice Quotas in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

       --availability-zone (string)
          The Availability Zone in which to create the Capacity Reservation.

       --availability-zone-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the  Availability  Zone in which to create the Capacity
          Reservation.

       --tenancy (string)
          Indicates the tenancy of the Capacity Reservation. A Capacity Reser-
          vation can have one of the following tenancy settings:

          o default  - The Capacity Reservation is created on hardware that is
            shared with other Amazon Web Services accounts.

          o dedicated - The Capacity Reservation is created  on  single-tenant
            hardware  that  is  dedicated  to  a  single  Amazon  Web Services
            account.

          Possible values:

          o default

          o dedicated

       --instance-count (integer)
          The number of instances for which to reserve capacity.

          Valid range: 1 - 1000

       --ebs-optimized | --no-ebs-optimized (boolean)
          Indicates whether the Capacity  Reservation  supports  EBS-optimized
          instances. This optimization provides dedicated throughput to Amazon
          EBS and an optimized configuration stack to provide optimal I/O per-
          formance. This optimization isn't available with all instance types.
          Additional  usage  charges  apply  when  using  an  EBS-   optimized
          instance.

       --ephemeral-storage | --no-ephemeral-storage (boolean)
          Indicates  whether  the Capacity Reservation supports instances with
          temporary, block-level storage.

       --end-date (timestamp)
          The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation expires. When  a
          Capacity  Reservation expires, the reserved capacity is released and
          you can no longer launch instances into it.  The  Capacity  Reserva-
          tion's  state  changes  to  expired when it reaches its end date and
          time.

          You must provide an EndDate value if EndDateType is limited  .  Omit
          EndDate if EndDateType is unlimited .

          If  the  EndDateType  is  limited , the Capacity Reservation is can-
          celled within an hour from the specified time. For example,  if  you
          specify  5/31/2019, 13:30:55, the Capacity Reservation is guaranteed
          to end between 13:30:55 and 14:30:55 on 5/31/2019.

       --end-date-type (string)
          Indicates the way in which the Capacity Reservation ends. A Capacity
          Reservation can have one of the following end types:

          o unlimited  -  The  Capacity  Reservation  remains active until you
            explicitly cancel it. Do not provide an EndDate if the EndDateType
            is unlimited .

          o limited  -  The  Capacity  Reservation  expires automatically at a
            specified date and time. You must provide an EndDate value if  the
            EndDateType value is limited .

          Possible values:

          o unlimited

          o limited

       --instance-match-criteria (string)
          Indicates  the  type of instance launches that the Capacity Reserva-
          tion accepts. The options include:

          o open  -  The  Capacity  Reservation  automatically   matches   all
            instances  that have matching attributes (instance type, platform,
            and Availability Zone). Instances that  have  matching  attributes
            run  in  the Capacity Reservation automatically without specifying
            any additional parameters.

          o targeted - The Capacity Reservation only  accepts  instances  that
            have  matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availabil-
            ity Zone), and explicitly target the  Capacity  Reservation.  This
            ensures  that only permitted instances can use the reserved capac-
            ity.

          Default: open

          Possible values:

          o open

          o targeted

       --tag-specifications (list)
          The tags to apply to the Capacity Reservation during launch.

          (structure)
              The tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being  cre-
              ated.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of resource to tag on creation.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The tags to apply to the resource.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                        Constraints:  Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a
                        maximum of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin  with
                        aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

                        Constraints:  Tag values are case-sensitive and accept
                        a maximum of 255 Unicode characters.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --outpost-arn (string)

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  cluster  placement  group  in
          which  to create the Capacity Reservation. For more information, see
          Capacity Reservations for cluster placement groups in the Amazon EC2
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To create a Capacity Reservation

       The  following  create-capacity-reservation  example creates a capacity
       reservation in the eu-west-1a Availability Zone,  into  which  you  can
       launch three t2.medium instances running a Linux/Unix operating system.
       By default, the capacity reservation  is  created  with  open  instance
       matching  criteria and no support for ephemeral storage, and it remains
       active until you manually cancel it.

          aws ec2 create-capacity-reservation \
              --availability-zone eu-west-1a \
              --instance-type t2.medium \
              --instance-platform Linux/UNIX \
              --instance-count 3

       Output:

          {
              "CapacityReservation": {
                  "CapacityReservationId": "cr-1234abcd56EXAMPLE ",
                  "EndDateType": "unlimited",
                  "AvailabilityZone": "eu-west-1a",
                  "InstanceMatchCriteria": "open",

                  "InstanceType": "t2.medium"
              }
          }

       Example 2: To create a Capacity Reservation that automatically ends  at
       a specified date/time

       The  following  create-capacity-reservation  example creates a capacity
       reservation in the eu-west-1a Availability Zone,  into  which  you  can
       launch  three m5.large instances running a Linux/Unix operating system.
       This capacity reservation automatically ends on 08/31/2019 at 23:59:59.

          aws ec2 create-capacity-reservation \
              --availability-zone eu-west-1a \
              --instance-type m5.large \
              --instance-platform Linux/UNIX \
              --instance-count 3 \
              --end-date-type limited \
              --end-date 2019-08-31T23:59:59Z

       Output:

          {
              "CapacityReservation": {
                  "CapacityReservationId": "cr-1234abcd56EXAMPLE ",
                  "EndDateType": "limited",

                  "InstanceType": "m5.large"
              }
          }

       Example  3: To create a Capacity Reservation that accepts only targeted
       instance launches

       The following create-capacity-reservation example  creates  a  capacity
       reservation that accepts only targeted instance launches.

          aws ec2 create-capacity-reservation \
              --availability-zone eu-west-1a \
              --instance-type m5.large \
              --instance-platform Linux/UNIX \
              --instance-count 3 \
              --instance-match-criteria targeted

       Output:

          {
              "CapacityReservation": {
                  "CapacityReservationId": "cr-1234abcd56EXAMPLE ",
                  "EndDateType": "unlimited",
                  "AvailabilityZone": "eu-west-1a",
                  "InstanceMatchCriteria": "targeted",
                  "EphemeralStorage": false,
                  "CreateDate": "2019-08-16T10:21:57.000Z",

                  "State": "active",
                  "Tenancy": "default",
                  "EbsOptimized": false,
                  "InstanceType": "m5.large"
              }
          }

                the date and time specified  in  your  request.  The  reserved
                capacity is no longer available for your use.

              o cancelled  -  The  Capacity  Reservation  was  cancelled.  The
                reserved capacity is no longer available for your use.

              o pending - The Capacity Reservation request was successful  but
                the capacity provisioning is still pending.

              o failed  -  The  Capacity  Reservation  request  has  failed. A
                request might fail due to invalid request parameters, capacity
                constraints,  or  instance  limit constraints. Failed requests
                are retained for 60 minutes.

          StartDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation was started.

          EndDate -> (timestamp)
              The  date  and  time  at which the Capacity Reservation expires.
              When a Capacity Reservation expires, the  reserved  capacity  is
              released  and  you  can  no longer launch instances into it. The
              Capacity Reservation's state changes to expired when it  reaches
              its end date and time.

          EndDateType -> (string)
              Indicates  the  way  in  which  the Capacity Reservation ends. A
              Capacity Reservation can have one of the following end types:

              o unlimited - The Capacity Reservation remains active until  you
                explicitly cancel it.

              o limited  - The Capacity Reservation expires automatically at a
                specified date and time.

          InstanceMatchCriteria -> (string)
              Indicates the type of instance launches that the Capacity Reser-
              vation accepts. The options include:

              o open  -  The  Capacity  Reservation accepts all instances that
                have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and  Avail-
                ability  Zone). Instances that have matching attributes launch
                into the Capacity Reservation automatically without specifying
                any additional parameters.

              o targeted  -  The  Capacity  Reservation only accepts instances
                that have matching attributes (instance  type,  platform,  and
                Availability  Zone), and explicitly target the Capacity Reser-
                vation. This ensures that only permitted instances can use the
                reserved capacity.

          CreateDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation was created.

          Tags -> (list)
              Any tags assigned to the Capacity Reservation.

              (structure)
                 Describes a tag.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key of the tag.

                     Constraints: Tag keys are  case-sensitive  and  accept  a
                     maximum  of  127  Unicode  characters. May not begin with
                     aws: .

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value of the tag.

                     Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and  accept  a
                     maximum of 255 Unicode characters.

          OutpostArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the Outpost on which the
              Capacity Reservation was created.

          CapacityReservationFleetId -> (string)
              The ID of the Capacity Reservation Fleet to which  the  Capacity
              Reservation  belongs.  Only valid for Capacity Reservations that
              were created by a Capacity Reservation Fleet.

          PlacementGroupArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster placement group in
              which  the  Capacity  Reservation was created. For more informa-
              tion, see Capacity Reservations for cluster placement groups  in
              the Amazon EC2 User Guide .
