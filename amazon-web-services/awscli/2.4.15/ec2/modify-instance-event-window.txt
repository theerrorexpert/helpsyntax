MODIFY-INSTANCE-EVENT-WINDOW()                  MODIFY-INSTANCE-EVENT-WINDOW()



NAME
       modify-instance-event-window -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies the specified event window.

       You  can  define  either a set of time ranges or a cron expression when
       modifying the event window, but not both.

       To modify the targets associated with the event window, use the   Asso-
       ciateInstanceEventWindow and  DisassociateInstanceEventWindow API.

       If  Amazon  Web  Services  has already scheduled an event, modifying an
       event window won't change the time of the scheduled event.

       For more information, see Define event windows for scheduled events  in
       the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

            modify-instance-event-window
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--name <value>]
          --instance-event-window-id <value>
          [--time-ranges <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --name (string)
          The name of the event window.

       --instance-event-window-id (string)
          The ID of the event window.

       --time-ranges (list)
          The time ranges of the event window.

          (structure)
              The start day and time and the end day  and  time  of  the  time
              range, in UTC.

              StartWeekDay -> (string)
                 The day on which the time range begins.

              StartHour -> (integer)
                 The hour when the time range begins.

              EndWeekDay -> (string)
                 The day on which the time range ends.

              EndHour -> (integer)
                 The hour when the time range ends.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          StartWeekDay=string,StartHour=integer,EndWeekDay=string,EndHour=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "StartWeekDay": "sunday"|"monday"|"tuesday"|"wednesday"|"thursday"|"friday"|"saturday",
              "StartHour": integer,
              "EndWeekDay": "sunday"|"monday"|"tuesday"|"wednesday"|"thursday"|"friday"|"saturday",
              "EndHour": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cron-expression (string)
          The  cron expression of the event window, for example, * 0-4,20-23 *
          * 1,5 .

          Constraints:

          o Only hour and day of the week values are supported.

          o For day of the week values, you  can  specify  either  integers  0
            through 6 , or alternative single values SUN through SAT .

          o The minute, month, and year must be specified by * .

          o The  hour  value must be one or a multiple range, for example, 0-4
            or 0-4,20-23 .

          o Each hour range must be >= 2 hours, for example, 0-2 or 20-23 .

          o The event window must be >=  4  hours.  The  combined  total  time
            ranges in the event window must be >= 4 hours.

          For  more  information  about  cron  expressions,  see  cron  on the
          Wikipedia website .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
