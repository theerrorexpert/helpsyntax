PURCHASE-SCHEDULED-INSTANCES()                  PURCHASE-SCHEDULED-INSTANCES()



NAME
       purchase-scheduled-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Purchases the Scheduled Instances with the specified schedule.

       Scheduled  Instances enable you to purchase Amazon EC2 compute capacity
       by the hour for a one-year term. Before you can  purchase  a  Scheduled
       Instance, you must call  DescribeScheduledInstanceAvailability to check
       for available schedules and obtain a purchase token. After you purchase
       a  Scheduled Instance, you must call  RunScheduledInstances during each
       scheduled time period.

       After you purchase a Scheduled Instance, you can't cancel,  modify,  or
       resell your purchase.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            purchase-scheduled-instances
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          --purchase-requests <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive  identifier  that ensures the idempotency of
          the request. For more information, see Ensuring Idempotency .

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --purchase-requests (list)
          The purchase requests.

          (structure)
              Describes a request to purchase Scheduled Instances.

              InstanceCount -> (integer)
                 The number of instances.

              PurchaseToken -> (string)
                 The purchase token.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          InstanceCount=integer,PurchaseToken=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "InstanceCount": integer,
              "PurchaseToken": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
