       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-ipam
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          --ipam-id <value>
          [--description <value>]
          [--add-operating-regions <value>]
          [--remove-operating-regions <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without actually making the request and provides an error  response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --ipam-id (string)
          The ID of the IPAM you want to modify.

       --description (string)
          The description of the IPAM you want to modify.

       --add-operating-regions (list)
          Choose the operating Regions for the  IPAM.  Operating  Regions  are
          Amazon  Web  Services Regions where the IPAM is allowed to manage IP
          address CIDRs. IPAM only discovers and  monitors  resources  in  the
          Amazon Web Services Regions you select as operating Regions.

          For  more information about operating Regions, see Create an IPAM in
          the Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide .

          (structure)
              Add an operating Region to an IPAM. Operating Regions are Amazon
              Web  Services  Regions  where  the  IPAM is allowed to manage IP
              address CIDRs. IPAM only discovers and monitors resources in the
              Amazon Web Services Regions you select as operating Regions.

              For more information about operating Regions, see Create an IPAM
              in the Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide .

              RegionName -> (string)
                 The name of the operating Region.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RegionName=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "RegionName": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --remove-operating-regions (list)
          The operating Regions to remove.

          (structure)
              Remove an operating Region from an IPAM. Operating  Regions  are
              Amazon  Web Services Regions where the IPAM is allowed to manage
              IP address CIDRs. IPAM only discovers and monitors resources  in
              the Amazon Web Services Regions you select as operating Regions.

              For more information about operating Regions, see Create an IPAM
              in the Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide

              RegionName -> (string)
                 The name of the operating Region you want to remove.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RegionName=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "RegionName": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To modify an IPAM

       The following modify-ipam example modifies an IPAM by adding an Operat-
       ing Region.

       (Linux):

          aws ec2 modify-ipam \
              --ipam-id ipam-08440e7a3acde3908 \
              --add-operating-regions RegionName=us-west-2

       (Windows):

          aws ec2 modify-ipam ^
              --ipam-id ipam-08440e7a3acde3908 ^
              --add-operating-regions RegionName=us-west-2
