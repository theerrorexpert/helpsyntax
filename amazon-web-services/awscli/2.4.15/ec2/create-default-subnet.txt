CREATE-DEFAULT-SUBNET()                                CREATE-DEFAULT-SUBNET()



NAME
       create-default-subnet -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a default subnet with a size /20 IPv4 CIDR block in the speci-
       fied Availability Zone in your default  VPC.  You  can  have  only  one
       default  subnet  per  Availability  Zone.  For  more  information,  see
       Creating a default subnet in the  Amazon  Virtual  Private  Cloud  User
       Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-default-subnet
          --availability-zone <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--ipv6-native | --no-ipv6-native]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --availability-zone (string)
          The Availability Zone in which to create the default subnet.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --ipv6-native | --no-ipv6-native (boolean)
          Indicates whether to create an IPv6 only subnet. If you already have
          a  default  subnet  for  this  Availability Zone, you must delete it
          before you can create an IPv6 only subnet.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 nets, an instance DNS name must be based on the instance IPv4
                 address.  For IPv6 only subnets, an instance DNS name must be
