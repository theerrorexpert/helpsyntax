SYNOPSIS
            modify-ipam-pool
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          --ipam-pool-id <value>
          [--description <value>]
          [--auto-import | --no-auto-import]
          [--allocation-min-netmask-length <value>]
          [--allocation-max-netmask-length <value>]
          [--allocation-default-netmask-length <value>]
          [--clear-allocation-default-netmask-length | --no-clear-allocation-default-netmask-length]
          [--add-allocation-resource-tags <value>]
          [--remove-allocation-resource-tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action
          without  actually making the request and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --ipam-pool-id (string)
          The ID of the IPAM pool you want to modify.

       --description (string)
          The description of the IPAM pool you want to modify.

       --auto-import | --no-auto-import (boolean)
          If  true,  IPAM will continuously look for resources within the CIDR
          range of this pool and automatically import them as allocations into
          your IPAM. The CIDRs that will be allocated for these resources must
          not already be allocated to other resources in order for the  import
          to  succeed.  IPAM  will  import a CIDR regardless of its compliance
          with the pool's allocation rules, so a resource  might  be  imported
          and  subsequently marked as noncompliant. If IPAM discovers multiple
          CIDRs that overlap, IPAM will import the largest CIDR only. If  IPAM
          discovers  multiple  CIDRs  with  matching CIDRs, IPAM will randomly
          import one of them only.

          A locale must be set on the pool for this feature to work.

       --allocation-min-netmask-length (integer)
          The minimum netmask length required for  CIDR  allocations  in  this
          IPAM  pool  to  be  compliant.  Possible  netmask  lengths  for IPv4
          addresses are 0 - 32. Possible netmask lengths  for  IPv6  addresses
          are  0 - 128. The minimum netmask length must be less than the maxi-
          mum netmask length.

       --allocation-max-netmask-length (integer)
          The maximum netmask length possible for  CIDR  allocations  in  this
          IPAM  pool  to  be  compliant.  Possible  netmask  lengths  for IPv4
          addresses are 0 - 32. Possible netmask lengths  for  IPv6  addresses
          are 0 - 128.The maximum netmask length must be greater than the min-
          imum netmask length.

       --allocation-default-netmask-length (integer)
          The default netmask length for allocations added to this  pool.  If,
          for  example,  the  CIDR assigned to this pool is 10.0.0.0/8 and you
          enter 16 here, new allocations will default to 10.0.0.0/16.

       --clear-allocation-default-netmask-length     |      --no-clear-alloca-
       tion-default-netmask-length (boolean)
          Clear the default netmask length allocation rule for this pool.

       --add-allocation-resource-tags (list)
          Add tag allocation rules to a pool. For more information about allo-
          cation rules, see Create a top-level pool in  the  Amazon  VPC  IPAM
          User Guide .

          (structure)
              A tag on an IPAM resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to
                 find all resources  assigned  a  tag  with  a  specific  key,
                 regardless of the tag value.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --remove-allocation-resource-tags (list)
          Remove tag allocation rules from a pool.

          (structure)
              A tag on an IPAM resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to
                 find all resources  assigned  a  tag  with  a  specific  key,
                 regardless of the tag value.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To modify an IPAM pool

       The following modify-ipam-pool example modifies an IPAM pool.

       (Linux):

          aws ec2 modify-ipam-pool \
              --ipam-pool-id ipam-pool-0533048da7d823723 \
              --add-allocation-resource-tags "Key=Owner,Value=Build Team" \
              --clear-allocation-default-netmask-length \
              --allocation-min-netmask-length 14

       (Windows):

          aws ec2 modify-ipam-pool ^
              --ipam-pool-id ipam-pool-0533048da7d823723 ^
              --add-allocation-resource-tags "Key=Owner,Value=Build Team" ^
              --clear-allocation-default-netmask-length ^
              --allocation-min-netmask-length 14

OUTPUT
       IpamPool -> (structure)
          The results of the modification.

          OwnerId -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services account ID of  the  owner  of  the  IPAM
              pool.

          IpamPoolId -> (string)
              The ID of the IPAM pool.

          SourceIpamPoolId -> (string)
              The  ID of the source IPAM pool. You can use this option to cre-
              ate an IPAM pool within an existing source pool.

          IpamPoolArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the IPAM pool.

          IpamScopeArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the scope of the IPAM pool.

          IpamScopeType -> (string)
              In IPAM, a scope is the highest-level container within IPAM.  An
              IPAM  contains  two default scopes. Each scope represents the IP
              space for a single network. The private scope  is  intended  for
              all  private  IP address space. The public scope is intended for
              all public IP address space.  Scopes  enable  you  to  reuse  IP
              addresses  across  multiple unconnected networks without causing
              IP address overlap or conflict.

          IpamArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the IPAM.

          IpamRegion -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services Region of the IPAM pool.

          Locale -> (string)
              The locale of the IPAM pool. In IPAM, the locale is  the  Amazon
              Web  Services  Region where you want to make an IPAM pool avail-
              able for allocations. Only resources in the same Region  as  the
              locale of the pool can get IP address allocations from the pool.
              You can only allocate a CIDR for a VPC,  for  example,  from  an
              IPAM  pool  that shares a locale with the VPCs Region. Note that
              once you choose a Locale for a pool, you cannot  modify  it.  If
              you choose an Amazon Web Services Region for locale that has not
              been configured as an operating Region for the IPAM, you'll  get
              an error.

          PoolDepth -> (integer)
              The  depth  of  pools in your IPAM pool. The pool depth quota is
              10. For more information, see Quotas in IPAM in the  Amazon  VPC
              IPAM User Guide .

          State -> (string)
              The state of the IPAM pool.

          StateMessage -> (string)
              A message related to the failed creation of an IPAM pool.

          Description -> (string)
              The description of the IPAM pool.

          AutoImport -> (boolean)
              If  selected,  IPAM  will continuously look for resources within
              the CIDR range of this pool and  automatically  import  them  as
              allocations into your IPAM. The CIDRs that will be allocated for
              these resources must not already be allocated to other resources
              in  order  for  the  import  to succeed. IPAM will import a CIDR
              regardless of its compliance with the pool's  allocation  rules,
              so  a resource might be imported and subsequently marked as non-
              compliant. If IPAM discovers multiple CIDRs that  overlap,  IPAM
              will  import  the  largest CIDR only. If IPAM discovers multiple
              CIDRs with matching CIDRs, IPAM will randomly import one of them
              only.

              A locale must be set on the pool for this feature to work.

          PubliclyAdvertisable -> (boolean)
              Determines  if  a  pool is publicly advertisable. This option is
              not available for pools with AddressFamily set to ipv4 .

          AddressFamily -> (string)
              The address family of the pool.

          AllocationMinNetmaskLength -> (integer)
              The minimum netmask length required for CIDR allocations in this
              IPAM  pool  to  be compliant. The minimum netmask length must be
              less than the maximum netmask length. Possible  netmask  lengths
              for IPv4 addresses are 0 - 32. Possible netmask lengths for IPv6
              addresses are 0 - 128.

          AllocationMaxNetmaskLength -> (integer)
              The maximum netmask length possible for CIDR allocations in this
              IPAM  pool  to  be compliant. The maximum netmask length must be
              greater  than  the  minimum  netmask  length.  Possible  netmask
              lengths  for IPv4 addresses are 0 - 32. Possible netmask lengths
              for IPv6 addresses are 0 - 128.

          AllocationDefaultNetmaskLength -> (integer)
              The default netmask length for allocations added to  this  pool.
              If,  for  example,  the CIDR assigned to this pool is 10.0.0.0/8
              and  you  enter  16  here,  new  allocations  will  default   to
              10.0.0.0/16.

          AllocationResourceTags -> (list)
              Tags  that  are  required for resources that use CIDRs from this
              IPAM pool. Resources that do not have these  tags  will  not  be
              allowed  to  allocate space from the pool. If the resources have
              their tags changed after they have allocated  space  or  if  the
              allocation  tagging  requirements  are  changed on the pool, the
              resource may be marked as noncompliant.

              (structure)
                 The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the  resource.
                 Use  the  tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the
                 filter value. For example, to find all resources that have  a
                 tag  with  the  key  Owner  and  the  value  TeamA  , specify
                 tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this fil-
                     ter to find all resources assigned a tag with a  specific
                     key, regardless of the tag value.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value of the tag.

          Tags -> (list)
              The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use
              the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as  the  filter
              value.  For  example, to find all resources that have a tag with
              the key Owner and the value TeamA , specify  tag:Owner  for  the
              filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

              (structure)
                 Describes a tag.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key of the tag.

                     Constraints:  Tag  keys  are  case-sensitive and accept a
                     maximum of 127 Unicode characters.  May  not  begin  with
                     aws: .

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value of the tag.

                     Constraints:  Tag  values are case-sensitive and accept a
                     maximum of 255 Unicode characters.

          AwsService -> (string)
              Limits which service in Amazon Web Services that the pool can be
              used in. "ec2", for example, allows users to use space for Elas-
              tic IP addresses and VPCs.
