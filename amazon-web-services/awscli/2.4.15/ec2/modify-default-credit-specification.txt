NAME
       modify-default-credit-specification -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  the  default credit option for CPU usage of burstable perfor-
       mance instances. The default credit option is set at the account  level
       per  Amazon  Web Services Region, and is specified per instance family.
       All new burstable performance instances in the account launch using the
       default credit option.
          ModifyDefaultCreditSpecification is an asynchronous operation, which
          works at an Amazon Web Services Region level and modifies the credit
          option for each Availability Zone. All zones in a Region are updated
          within five minutes. But if instances are launched during this oper-
          ation,  they  might  not get the new credit option until the zone is
          updated. To verify whether the update has  occurred,  you  can  call
          GetDefaultCreditSpecification  and  check DefaultCreditSpecification
          for updates.

       For more information, see Burstable performance instances in the Amazon
       EC2 User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            modify-default-credit-specification
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          --instance-family <value>
          --cpu-credits <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --instance-family (string)
          The instance family.

          Possible values:

          o t2

          o t3

          o t3a

          o t4g

       --cpu-credits (string)
          The credit option for CPU usage of the instance family.

          Valid Values: standard | unlimited

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To modify the default credit option

       The following modify-default-credit-specification example modifies  the
       default credit option for T2 instances.

          aws ec2 modify-default-credit-specification \
              --instance-family t2 \
              --cpu-credits unlimited

       Output:

          {
              "InstanceFamilyCreditSpecification": {
                  "InstanceFamily": "t2",
                  "CpuCredits": "unlimited"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       InstanceFamilyCreditSpecification -> (structure)
          The default credit option for CPU usage of the instance family.

          InstanceFamily -> (string)
              The instance family.

          CpuCredits -> (string)
              The  default credit option for CPU usage of the instance family.
              Valid values are standard and unlimited .
