CREATE-VPC-ENDPOINT-CONNECTION-NOCREATE-VPC-ENDPOINT-CONNECTION-NOTIFICATION()



NAME
       create-vpc-endpoint-connection-notification -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  connection notification for a specified VPC endpoint or VPC
       endpoint service. A connection notification notifies  you  of  specific
       endpoint events. You must create an SNS topic to receive notifications.
       For more information, see Create a Topic in the Amazon Simple Notifica-
       tion Service Developer Guide .

       You  can create a connection notification for interface endpoints only.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-vpc-endpoint-connection-notification
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--service-id <value>]
          [--vpc-endpoint-id <value>]
          --connection-notification-arn <value>
          --connection-events <value>
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --service-id (string)
          The ID of the endpoint service.

       --vpc-endpoint-id (string)
          The ID of the endpoint.

       --connection-notification-arn (string)
          The ARN of the SNS topic for the notifications.

       --connection-events (list)
          One  or  more  endpoint  events  for which to receive notifications.
          Valid values are Accept , Connect , Delete , and Reject .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --client-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you  provide  to  ensure  the
          idempotency  of the request. For more information, see How to ensure
          idempotency .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create an endpoint connection notification

       This example creates a notification for  a  specific  endpoint  service
       that alerts you when interface endpoints have connected to your service
       and when endpoints have been accepted for your service.

       Command:

          aws ec2 create-vpc-endpoint-connection-notification --connection-notification-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-2:123456789012:VpceNotification --connection-events Connect Accept --service-id vpce-svc-1237881c0d25a3abc

       Output:

          {
             "ConnectionNotification": {
                 "ConnectionNotificationState": "Enabled",
                 "ConnectionNotificationType": "Topic",
                 "ServiceId": "vpce-svc-1237881c0d25a3abc",
                 "ConnectionEvents": [
                     "Accept",
                     "Connect"
                 ],
                 "ConnectionNotificationId": "vpce-nfn-008776de7e03f5abc",
                 "ConnectionNotificationArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-2:123456789012:VpceNotification"
             }
           }

OUTPUT
       ConnectionNotification -> (structure)
          Information about the notification.

          ConnectionNotificationId -> (string)
              The ID of the notification.

          ServiceId -> (string)
              The ID of the endpoint service.

          VpcEndpointId -> (string)
              The ID of the VPC endpoint.

          ConnectionNotificationType -> (string)
              The type of notification.

          ConnectionNotificationArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the SNS topic for the notification.

          ConnectionEvents -> (list)
              The events for the notification. Valid values are Accept ,  Con-
              nect , Delete , and Reject .

              (string)

          ConnectionNotificationState -> (string)
              The state of the notification.

       ClientToken -> (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive  identifier  that  you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request.
