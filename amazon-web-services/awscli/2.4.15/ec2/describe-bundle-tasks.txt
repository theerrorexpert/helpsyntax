DESCRIBE-BUNDLE-TASKS()                                DESCRIBE-BUNDLE-TASKS()



NAME
       describe-bundle-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the specified bundle tasks or all of your bundle tasks.

       NOTE:
          Completed  bundle  tasks are listed for only a limited time. If your
          bundle task is no longer in the list, you can still register an  AMI
          from  it.  Just use RegisterImage with the Amazon S3 bucket name and
          image manifest name you provided to the bundle task.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-bundle-tasks
          [--bundle-ids <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bundle-ids (list)
          The bundle task IDs.

          Default: Describes all your bundle tasks.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          The filters.

          o bundle-id - The ID of the bundle task.

          o error-code - If the task failed, the error code returned.

          o error-message - If the task failed, the error message returned.

          o instance-id - The ID of the instance.

          o progress - The level of task  completion,  as  a  percentage  (for
            example, 20%).

          o s3-bucket - The Amazon S3 bucket to store the AMI.

          o s3-prefix - The beginning of the AMI name.

          o start-time   -   The   time   the   task   started  (for  example,
            2013-09-15T17:15:20.000Z).

          o state - The state of the task (pending  |  waiting-for-shutdown  |
            bundling | storing | cancelling | complete | failed ).

          o update-time - The time of the most recent update for the task.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
