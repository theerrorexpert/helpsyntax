OPTIONS
       --availability-zone-group (string)
          The user-specified name for a logical grouping of requests.

          When you specify an Availability  Zone  group  in  a  Spot  Instance
          request,  all Spot Instances in the request are launched in the same
          Availability Zone. Instance proximity is maintained with this param-
          eter,  but the choice of Availability Zone is not. The group applies
          only to requests for Spot Instances of the same instance  type.  Any
          additional  Spot  Instance requests that are specified with the same
          Availability Zone group name are launched in that same  Availability
          Zone,  as  long  as  at  least  one instance from the group is still
          active.

          If there is no active instance  running  in  the  Availability  Zone
          group  that  you  specify  for  a  new  Spot  Instance  request (all
          instances are terminated, the request is  expired,  or  the  maximum
          price you specified falls below current Spot price), then Amazon EC2
          launches the instance in any Availability Zone where the  constraint
          can be met. Consequently, the subsequent set of Spot Instances could
          be placed in a different zone from the original request, even if you
          specified the same Availability Zone group.

          Default:  Instances are launched in any available Availability Zone.

       --block-duration-minutes (integer)
          Deprecated.

       --client-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you  provide  to  ensure  the
          idempotency  of the request. For more information, see How to Ensure
          Idempotency in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances .

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --instance-count (integer)
          The maximum number of Spot Instances to launch.

          Default: 1

       --launch-group (string)
          The  instance  launch  group.  Launch groups are Spot Instances that
          launch together and terminate together.

          Default: Instances are launched and terminated individually

       --launch-specification (structure)
          The launch specification.

          SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
              One or more security group IDs.

              (string)

          SecurityGroups -> (list)
              One or more security groups. When requesting instances in a VPC,
              you must specify the IDs of the security groups. When requesting
              instances in EC2-Classic, you can specify the names or  the  IDs
              of the security groups.

              (string)

          AddressingType -> (string)
              Deprecated.

          BlockDeviceMappings -> (list)
              One or more block device mapping entries. You can't specify both
              a snapshot ID and an encryption  value.  This  is  because  only
              blank volumes can be encrypted on creation. If a snapshot is the
              basis for a volume, it is not blank and its encryption status is
              used for the volume encryption status.

              (structure)
                 Describes  a block device mapping, which defines the EBS vol-
                 umes and instance store volumes to attach to an  instance  at
                 launch.

                 DeviceName -> (string)
                     The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh ).

                 VirtualName -> (string)
                     The  virtual  device  name  (ephemeral N). Instance store
                     volumes are numbered starting from 0.  An  instance  type
                     with  2 available instance store volumes can specify map-
                     pings for ephemeral0  and  ephemeral1  .  The  number  of
                     available  instance store volumes depends on the instance
                     type. After you connect to the instance, you  must  mount
                     the volume.

                     NVMe  instance store volumes are automatically enumerated
                     and assigned a device name. Including them in your  block
                     device mapping has no effect.

                     Constraints:  For M3 instances, you must specify instance
                     store  volumes  in  the  block  device  mapping  for  the
                     instance.  When  you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any
                     instance store volumes specified in the block device map-
                     ping for the AMI.

                 Ebs -> (structure)
                     Parameters  used to automatically set up EBS volumes when
                     the instance is launched.

                     DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                        Indicates  whether  the  EBS  volume  is  deleted   on
                        instance   termination.   For  more  information,  see
                        Preserving Amazon EBS volumes on instance  termination
                        in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

                     Iops -> (integer)
                        The  number  of  I/O operations per second (IOPS). For
                        gp3 , io1 , and io2 volumes, this represents the  num-
                        ber  of  IOPS that are provisioned for the volume. For
                        gp2 volumes, this represents the baseline  performance
                        of the volume and the rate at which the volume accumu-
                        lates I/O credits for bursting.

                        The following are the supported values for each volume
                        type:

                        o gp3 : 3,000-16,000 IOPS

                        o io1 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                        o io2 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                        For io1 and io2 volumes, we guarantee 64,000 IOPS only
                        for Instances  built  on  the  Nitro  System  .  Other
                        instance  families  guarantee performance up to 32,000
                        IOPS.

                        This parameter is required for io1  and  io2  volumes.
                        The default for gp3 volumes is 3,000 IOPS. This param-
                        eter is not supported for gp2 , st1 , sc1 ,  or  stan-
                        dard volumes.

                     SnapshotId -> (string)
                        The ID of the snapshot.

                     VolumeSize -> (integer)
                        The  size  of  the  volume,  in GiBs. You must specify
                        either a snapshot ID or a volume size. If you  specify
                        a  snapshot, the default is the snapshot size. You can
                        specify a volume size that is equal to or larger  than
                        the snapshot size.

                        The following are the supported volumes sizes for each
                        volume type:

                        o gp2 and gp3 :1-16,384

                        o io1 and io2 : 4-16,384

                        o st1 and sc1 : 125-16,384

                        o standard : 1-1,024

                     VolumeType -> (string)
                        The volume type. For more information, see Amazon  EBS
                        volume  types  in  the  Amazon EC2 User Guide . If the
                        volume type is io1 or io2 , you must specify the  IOPS
                        that the volume supports.

                     KmsKeyId -> (string)
                        Identifier  (key  ID, key alias, ID ARN, or alias ARN)
                        for a customer managed CMK under which the EBS  volume
                        is encrypted.

                        This parameter is only supported on BlockDeviceMapping
                        objects called by RunInstances  ,  RequestSpotFleet  ,
                        and RequestSpotInstances .

                     Throughput -> (integer)
                        The throughput that the volume supports, in MiB/s.

                        This parameter is valid only for gp3 volumes.

                        Valid  Range:  Minimum  value of 125. Maximum value of
                        1000.

                     OutpostArn -> (string)
                        The ARN of  the  Outpost  on  which  the  snapshot  is
                        stored.

                     Encrypted -> (boolean)
                        Indicates  whether the encryption state of an EBS vol-
                        ume is changed while being  restored  from  a  backing
                        snapshot.  The  effect of setting the encryption state
                        to true depends on the volume origin (new  or  from  a
                        snapshot),  starting  encryption state, ownership, and
                        whether encryption by default  is  enabled.  For  more
                        information,  see  Amazon EBS encryption in the Amazon
                        EC2 User Guide .

                        In no case can you remove encryption from an encrypted
                        volume.

                        Encrypted  volumes  can  only be attached to instances
                        that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more  informa-
                        tion, see Supported instance types .

                        This parameter is not returned by .

                 NoDevice -> (string)
                     To omit the device from the block device mapping, specify
                     an empty string. When this  property  is  specified,  the
                     device  is  removed from the block device mapping regard-
                     less of the assigned value.

          EbsOptimized -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether the instance is optimized for  EBS  I/O.  This
              optimization  provides dedicated throughput to Amazon EBS and an
              optimized configuration stack to provide optimal EBS I/O perfor-
              mance.  This  optimization  isn't  available  with  all instance
              types. Additional usage charges apply when using  an  EBS  Opti-
              mized instance.

              Default: false

          IamInstanceProfile -> (structure)
              The IAM instance profile.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance profile.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the instance profile.

          ImageId -> (string)
              The ID of the AMI.

          InstanceType -> (string)
              The instance type.

          KernelId -> (string)
              The ID of the kernel.

          KeyName -> (string)
              The name of the key pair.

          Monitoring -> (structure)
              Indicates  whether  basic  or detailed monitoring is enabled for
              the instance.

              Default: Disabled

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether detailed monitoring is enabled.  Otherwise,
                 basic monitoring is enabled.

          NetworkInterfaces -> (list)
              One  or more network interfaces. If you specify a network inter-
              face, you must specify subnet IDs and security group  IDs  using
              the network interface.

              (structure)
                 Describes a network interface.

                 AssociatePublicIpAddress -> (boolean)
                     Indicates  whether  to assign a public IPv4 address to an
                     instance you launch in a VPC. The public IP  address  can
                     only be assigned to a network interface for eth0, and can
                     only be assigned to  a  new  network  interface,  not  an
                     existing  one.  You  cannot specify more than one network
                     interface in the request. If  launching  into  a  default
                     subnet, the default value is true .

                 DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                     If  set  to  true  ,  the  interface  is deleted when the
                     instance is terminated. You can specify true only if cre-
                     ating a new network interface when launching an instance.

                 Description -> (string)
                     The description of the network interface. Applies only if
                     creating  a network interface when launching an instance.

                 DeviceIndex -> (integer)
                     The position of the network interface in  the  attachment
                     order.  A primary network interface has a device index of
                     0.

                     If you specify a  network  interface  when  launching  an
                     instance, you must specify the device index.

                 Groups -> (list)
                     The IDs of the security groups for the network interface.
                     Applies only if creating a network interface when launch-
                     ing an instance.

                     (string)

                 Ipv6AddressCount -> (integer)
                     A  number  of  IPv6  addresses  to  assign to the network
                     interface. Amazon EC2 chooses the IPv6 addresses from the
                     range  of  the subnet. You cannot specify this option and
                     the option to assign specific IPv6 addresses in the  same
                     request.  You can specify this option if you've specified
                     a minimum number of instances to launch.

                 Ipv6Addresses -> (list)
                     One or more IPv6  addresses  to  assign  to  the  network
                     interface.  You cannot specify this option and the option
                     to assign a number of IPv6 addresses in the same request.
                     You cannot specify this option if you've specified a min-
                     imum number of instances to launch.

                     (structure)
                        Describes an IPv6 address.

                        Ipv6Address -> (string)
                            The IPv6 address.

                 NetworkInterfaceId -> (string)
                     The ID of the network interface.

                     If you are creating a Spot  Fleet,  omit  this  parameter
                     because  you  cant  specify  a  network interface ID in a
                     launch specification.

                 PrivateIpAddress -> (string)
                     The  private  IPv4  address  of  the  network  interface.
                     Applies only if creating a network interface when launch-
                     ing an instance. You cannot specify this option if you're
                     launching  more  than  one  instance  in  a  RunInstances
                     request.

                 PrivateIpAddresses -> (list)
                     One or more private IPv4 addresses to assign to the  net-
                     work interface. Only one private IPv4 address can be des-
                     ignated as primary. You cannot  specify  this  option  if
                     you're launching more than one instance in a RunInstances
                     request.

                     (structure)
                        Describes a secondary private IPv4 address for a  net-
                        work interface.

                        Primary -> (boolean)

                     specify this option and specify more than one private  IP
                     address using the private IP addresses option. You cannot
                     specify this option if you're  launching  more  than  one
                     instance in a RunInstances request.

                     You can only assign a carrier IP  address  to  a  network
                     interface  that  is in a subnet in a Wavelength Zone. For
                     more information about carrier IP addresses, see  Carrier
                     IP addresses in the Amazon Web Services Wavelength Devel-

                 NetworkCardIndex -> (integer)
                     The index of the network card. Some instance  types  sup-
                     port  multiple  network cards. The primary network inter-
                     face must be  assigned  to  network  card  index  0.  The
                     default is network card index 0.

                     If  you  are  using  RequestSpotInstances  to create Spot
                     Instances, omit this parameter because you  cant  specify
                     the  network  card  index when using this API. To specify
                     the network card index, use RunInstances .

                 Ipv4Prefixes -> (list)
                     One or more IPv4 delegated prefixes to be assigned to the
                     network  interface. You cannot use this option if you use
                     the Ipv4PrefixCount option.

                     (structure)
                        Describes the IPv4 prefix option for a network  inter-

                        Ipv4Prefix -> (string)
                            The  IPv4  prefix.  For information, see Assigning
                            prefixes to Amazon EC2 network interfaces  in  the
                            Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

                 Ipv4PrefixCount -> (integer)
                     The number of IPv4 delegated prefixes to be automatically
                     assigned to the network interface. You  cannot  use  this
                     option if you use the Ipv4Prefix option.

                 Ipv6Prefixes -> (list)
                     One or more IPv6 delegated prefixes to be assigned to the
                     network interface. You cannot use this option if you  use
                     the Ipv6PrefixCount option.

       --spot-price (string)
          The maximum price per hour that you are willing to pay  for  a  Spot
          Instance. The default is the On-Demand price.

       --type (string)
          The Spot Instance request type.

          Default: one-time

          Possible values:

          o one-time

          o persistent

       --valid-from (timestamp)
          The  start  date  of the request. If this is a one-time request, the
          request becomes active at this date  and  time  and  remains  active
          until  all  instances launch, the request expires, or the request is
          canceled. If the request is persistent, the request  becomes  active
          at this date and time and remains active until it expires or is can-
          celed.

          The specified start date and time cannot be  equal  to  the  current
          date  and  time.  You must specify a start date and time that occurs
          after the current date and time.

       --valid-until (timestamp)
          The end date of the request, in UTC format (YYYY -MM -DD  T*HH*  :MM
          :SS Z).

          o For  a  persistent  request,  the request remains active until the
            ValidUntil date  and  time  is  reached.  Otherwise,  the  request
            remains active until you cancel it.

          o For  a  one-time  request,  the  request  remains active until all
            instances launch, the request is canceled, or the ValidUntil  date
            and  time  is reached. By default, the request is valid for 7 days
            from the date the request was created.

       --tag-specifications (list)
          The key-value pair for tagging the Spot  Instance  request  on  cre-
          ation.  The  value for ResourceType must be spot-instances-request ,
          otherwise the Spot Instance request fails. To tag the Spot  Instance
          request after it has been created, see CreateTags .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To request Spot Instances

       This example command creates a one-time Spot Instance request for  five
       instances in the specified Availability Zone.  If your account supports
       EC2-VPC only, Amazon EC2 launches the instances in the  default  subnet
       of the specified Availability Zone.  If your account supports EC2-Clas-
       sic, Amazon EC2 launches the instances in EC2-Classic in the  specified
       Availability Zone.

       Command:

          aws ec2 request-spot-instances --spot-price "0.03" --instance-count 5 --type "one-time" --launch-specification file://specification.json

                            merated and assigned a device name. Including them
                            in your block device mapping has no effect.

                            Constraints:  For  M3  instances, you must specify
                            instance store volumes in the block device mapping
                            for  the instance. When you launch an M3 instance,
                            we ignore any instance store volumes specified  in
                            the block device mapping for the AMI.

                        Ebs -> (structure)
                            Parameters  used  to automatically set up EBS vol-
                            umes when the instance is launched.

                            DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                               Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted  on
                               instance termination. For more information, see
                               Preserving Amazon EBS volumes on instance  ter-
                               mination in the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

                            Iops -> (integer)
                               The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS).
                               For gp3 , io1 , and io2  volumes,  this  repre-
                               sents  the  number of IOPS that are provisioned
                               for the volume. For gp2  volumes,  this  repre-
                               sents  the  baseline  performance of the volume
                               and the rate at which  the  volume  accumulates
                               I/O credits for bursting.

                               The following are the supported values for each
                               volume type:

                               o gp3 : 3,000-16,000 IOPS

                               o io1 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                               o io2 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                               For io1 and io2 volumes,  we  guarantee  64,000
                               IOPS only for Instances built on the Nitro Sys-
                               tem . Other instance families guarantee perfor-
                               mance up to 32,000 IOPS.

                               This parameter is required for io1 and io2 vol-
                               umes. The default  for  gp3  volumes  is  3,000
                               IOPS. This parameter is not supported for gp2 ,
                               st1 , sc1 , or standard volumes.

                            SnapshotId -> (string)
                               The ID of the snapshot.

                            VolumeSize -> (integer)
                               The size of the volume, in GiBs. You must spec-
                               ify  either  a snapshot ID or a volume size. If
                               you specify a  snapshot,  the  default  is  the
                               snapshot  size.  You  can specify a volume size
                               that is equal to or larger  than  the  snapshot
                               size.

                               The  following  are the supported volumes sizes
                               for each volume type:

                               o gp2 and gp3 :1-16,384

                               o io1 and io2 : 4-16,384

                               o st1 and sc1 : 125-16,384

                               o standard : 1-1,024

                            VolumeType -> (string)
                               The volume  type.  For  more  information,  see
                               Amazon  EBS volume types in the Amazon EC2 User
                               Guide . If the volume type is io1 or io2 ,  you
                               must specify the IOPS that the volume supports.

                            KmsKeyId -> (string)
                               Identifier (key ID, key alias, ID ARN, or alias
                               ARN) for a customer managed CMK under which the
                               EBS volume is encrypted.

                               This parameter is only  supported  on  BlockDe-
                               viceMapping  objects  called  by RunInstances ,
                               RequestSpotFleet , and RequestSpotInstances .

                            Throughput -> (integer)
                               The throughput that  the  volume  supports,  in
                               MiB/s.

                               This parameter is valid only for gp3 volumes.

                               Valid  Range:  Minimum  value  of  125. Maximum
                               value of 1000.

                            OutpostArn -> (string)
                               The ARN of the Outpost on which the snapshot is
                               stored.

                            Encrypted -> (boolean)
                               Indicates  whether  the  encryption state of an
                               EBS volume is changed while being restored from
                               a  backing  snapshot. The effect of setting the
                               encryption state to true depends on the  volume
                               origin  (new  or  from  a  snapshot),  starting
                               encryption  state,   ownership,   and   whether
                               encryption  by  default  is  enabled.  For more
                               information, see Amazon EBS encryption  in  the
                               Amazon EC2 User Guide .

                               In  no  case  can you remove encryption from an
                               encrypted volume.

                               Encrypted  volumes  can  only  be  attached  to
                               instances  that  support Amazon EBS encryption.

                               types .

                               This parameter is not returned by .

                        NoDevice -> (string)
                            To  omit the device from the block device mapping,
                            specify an empty string.  When  this  property  is
                            specified,  the  device  is removed from the block
                            device mapping regardless of the assigned value.

                 EbsOptimized -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether the instance is optimized for EBS  I/O.
                     This optimization provides dedicated throughput to Amazon
                     EBS and an optimized configuration stack to provide opti-
                     mal  EBS  I/O performance. This optimization isn't avail-
                     able with all instance types.  Additional  usage  charges
                     apply when using an EBS Optimized instance.

                 NetworkInterfaces -> (list)
                     One or more network interfaces. If you specify a  network
                     interface, you must specify subnet IDs and security group
                     IDs using the network interface.

                     (structure)
                        Describes a network interface.

                        AssociatePublicIpAddress -> (boolean)
                            Indicates whether to assign a public IPv4  address
                            to  an instance you launch in a VPC. The public IP
                            address can only be assigned to a  network  inter-
                            face  for  eth0, and can only be assigned to a new
                            network interface, not an existing one. You cannot
                            specify  more  than  one  network interface in the
                            request. If launching into a default  subnet,  the
                            default value is true .

                        DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)
                            If set to true , the interface is deleted when the
                            instance is terminated. You can specify true  only
                            if creating a new network interface when launching
                            an instance.

                        Description -> (string)

                            only  if creating a network interface when launch-
                            ing an instance.

                        DeviceIndex -> (integer)
                            The position  of  the  network  interface  in  the
                            attachment  order. A primary network interface has
                            a device index of 0.

                            If you specify a network interface when  launching
                            an instance, you must specify the device index.

                            work  interface.  Amazon  EC2  chooses  the   IPv6
                            addresses from the range of the subnet. You cannot
                            specify this option and the option to assign  spe-
                            cific  IPv6 addresses in the same request. You can
                            specify this option if you've specified a  minimum
                            number of instances to launch.

                        Ipv6Addresses -> (list)
                            One  or  more IPv6 addresses to assign to the net-
                            work interface. You cannot specify this option and
                            the option to assign a number of IPv6 addresses in
                            the same request. You cannot specify  this  option
                            if  you've specified a minimum number of instances
                            to launch.

                            The ID of the network interface.

                            If you are creating a Spot Fleet, omit this param-
                            eter  because you cant specify a network interface
                            ID in a launch specification.

                        PrivateIpAddress -> (string)
                            The private IPv4 address of the network interface.
                            Applies  only if creating a network interface when
                            launching an instance.  You  cannot  specify  this
                            option  if you're launching more than one instance
                            in a RunInstances request.

                        PrivateIpAddresses -> (list)
                            One or more private IPv4 addresses  to  assign  to
                            the  network  interface.  Only  one  private  IPv4
                            address can be designated as primary.  You  cannot
                            specify  this option if you're launching more than
                            one instance in a RunInstances request.

                            (structure)
                               Describes a secondary private IPv4 address  for
                               a network interface.

                                   Indicates  whether the private IPv4 address
                                   is the primary private IPv4  address.  Only
                                   one  IPv4 address can be designated as pri-
                                   mary.

                               PrivateIpAddress -> (string)

                            The number of secondary  private  IPv4  addresses.
                            You  can't  specify  this  option and specify more
                            than one private IP address using the  private  IP
                            addresses  option.  You cannot specify this option
                            if you're launching more than one  instance  in  a
                            RunInstances request.

                        SubnetId -> (string)
                            The  ID  of the subnet associated with the network
                            interface. Applies  only  if  creating  a  network
                            interface when launching an instance.
