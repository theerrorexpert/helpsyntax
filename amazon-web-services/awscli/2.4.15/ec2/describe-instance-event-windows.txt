NAME
       describe-instance-event-windows -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the specified event windows or all event windows.

       If  you  specify  event window IDs, the output includes information for
       only the specified event windows. If you specify  filters,  the  output
       includes  information for only those event windows that meet the filter
       criteria. If you do not specify event windows IDs or filters, the  out-
       put  includes  information for all event windows, which can affect per-
       formance. We recommend that you use pagination to ensure that the oper-
       ation returns quickly and successfully.

       For  more information, see Define event windows for scheduled events in
       the Amazon EC2 User Guide .

       describe-instance-event-windows is a paginated operation. Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: InstanceEventWindows

SYNOPSIS
            describe-instance-event-windows
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--instance-event-window-ids <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --instance-event-window-ids (list)
          The IDs of the event windows.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          One or more filters.

          o dedicated-host-id - The event windows associated with  the  speci-
            fied Dedicated Host ID.

          o event-window-name  -  The event windows associated with the speci-
            fied names.

          o instance-id - The event  windows  associated  with  the  specified
            instance ID.

          o instance-tag - The event windows associated with the specified tag
            and value.

          o instance-tag-key - The event windows associated with the specified
            tag key, regardless of the value.

          o instance-tag-value  - The event windows associated with the speci-
            fied tag value, regardless of the key.

          o tag:<key> - The key/value combination of a  tag  assigned  to  the
            event window. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value
            as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that  have
            a tag with the key Owner and the value CMX , specify tag:Owner for
            the filter name and CMX for the filter value.

          o tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the event window. Use  this
            filter  to  find all event windows that have a tag with a specific
            key, regardless of the tag value.

          o tag-value - The value of a tag assigned to the event  window.  Use
            this  filter to find all event windows that have a tag with a spe-
            cific value, regardless of the tag key.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If  you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  values. Filter values are case-sensitive. If you
                 specify multiple values for a filter, the values  are  joined
                 with  an  OR , and the request returns all results that match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
