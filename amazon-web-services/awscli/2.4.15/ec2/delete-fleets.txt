DELETE-FLEETS()                                                DELETE-FLEETS()



NAME
       delete-fleets -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the specified EC2 Fleet.

       After you delete an EC2 Fleet, it launches no new instances.

       You  must specify whether a deleted EC2 Fleet should also terminate its
       instances. If you choose to terminate  the  instances,  the  EC2  Fleet
       enters  the  deleted_terminating state. Otherwise, the EC2 Fleet enters
       the deleted_running state, and the instances continue to run until they
       are interrupted or you terminate them manually.

       For  instant  fleets,  EC2  Fleet must terminate the instances when the
       fleet is deleted. A deleted instant fleet with running instances is not
       supported.
          Restrictions

       o You  can  delete  up to 25 instant fleets in a single request. If you
         exceed this number, no instant fleets are deleted  and  an  error  is
         returned.  There  is  no  restriction on the number of fleets of type
         maintain or request that can be deleted in a single request.

       o Up to 1000 instances can be terminated in a single request to  delete
         instant fleets.

       Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            delete-fleets
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          --fleet-ids <value>
          --terminate-instances | --no-terminate-instances
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --fleet-ids (list)
          The IDs of the EC2 Fleets.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --terminate-instances | --no-terminate-instances (boolean)
          Indicates  whether  to terminate the instances when the EC2 Fleet is
          deleted. The default is to terminate the instances.

          To let the instances continue to run after the EC2 Fleet is deleted,
          specify  NoTerminateInstances  .  Supported  only for fleets of type
          maintain and request .

          For instant fleets, you  cannot  specify  NoTerminateInstances  .  A
          deleted instant fleet with running instances is not supported.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete an EC2 Fleet

       The following delete-fleets example deletes the specified EC2 Fleet and
       terminates the associated instances.

          aws ec2 delete-fleets \
              --fleet-ids fleet-12a34b55-67cd-8ef9-ba9b-9208dEXAMPLE \
              --terminate-instances

       Output:

          {
              "SuccessfulFleetDeletions": [
                  {
                      "CurrentFleetState": "deleted_terminating",
                      "PreviousFleetState": "active",
                      "FleetId": "fleet-12a34b55-67cd-8ef9-ba9b-9208dEXAMPLE"
                  }
              ],
              "UnsuccessfulFleetDeletions": []
          }
