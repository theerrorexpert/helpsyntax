NAME
       describe-traffic-mirror-sessions -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  one or more Traffic Mirror sessions. By default, all Traffic
       Mirror sessions  are  described.  Alternatively,  you  can  filter  the
       results.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-traffic-mirror-sessions is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: TrafficMirrorSessions

SYNOPSIS
            describe-traffic-mirror-sessions
          [--traffic-mirror-session-ids <value>]
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --traffic-mirror-session-ids (list)
          The ID of the Traffic Mirror session.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks whether you have the required  permissions  for  the  action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If you have the required permissions, the error response is  DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --filters (list)
          One or more filters. The possible values are:

          o description : The Traffic Mirror session description.

          o network-interface-id  :  The ID of the Traffic Mirror session net-
            work interface.

          o owner-id : The ID of the account that owns the Traffic Mirror ses-
            sion.

          o packet-length : The assigned number of packets to mirror.

          o session-number : The assigned session number.

          o traffic-mirror-filter-id : The ID of the Traffic Mirror filter.

          o traffic-mirror-session-id  : The ID of the Traffic Mirror session.

          o traffic-mirror-target-id : The ID of the Traffic Mirror target.

          o virtual-network-id : The virtual network ID of the Traffic  Mirror
            session.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              tags, attributes, or IDs.

              If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined with  an
              AND , and the request returns only results that match all of the
              specified filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.  If  you
                 specify  multiple  values for a filter, the values are joined
                 with an OR , and the request returns all results  that  match
                 any of the specified values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TrafficMirrorSessions -> (list)
          Describes one or more Traffic Mirror sessions. By default, all Traf-
          fic Mirror sessions are described. Alternatively, you can filter the
          results.

          (structure)
              Describes a Traffic Mirror session.

              TrafficMirrorSessionId -> (string)
                 The ID for the Traffic Mirror session.

              TrafficMirrorTargetId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Traffic Mirror target.

              TrafficMirrorFilterId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Traffic Mirror filter.

              NetworkInterfaceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Traffic Mirror session's network interface.

              OwnerId -> (string)
                 The ID of the account that owns the Traffic Mirror session.

              PacketLength -> (integer)
                 The number of bytes in each packet to mirror. These  are  the
                 bytes after the VXLAN header. To mirror a subset, set this to
                 the length (in bytes) to mirror. For example, if you set this
                 value  to  100, then the first 100 bytes that meet the filter
                 criteria are copied to the target. Do not specify this param-
                 eter when you want to mirror the entire packet

              SessionNumber -> (integer)
                 The session number determines the order in which sessions are
                 evaluated when an interface is used by multiple sessions. The
                 first  session with a matching filter is the one that mirrors
                 the packets.

                 Valid values are 1-32766.

              VirtualNetworkId -> (integer)
                 The virtual network ID associated  with  the  Traffic  Mirror
                 session.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the Traffic Mirror session.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The tags assigned to the Traffic Mirror session.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                        Constraints:  Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a
                        maximum of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin  with
                        aws: .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

                        Constraints:  Tag values are case-sensitive and accept
                        a maximum of 255 Unicode characters.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. The value  is
          null when there are no more results to return.
