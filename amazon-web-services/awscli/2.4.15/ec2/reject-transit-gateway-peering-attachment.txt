NAME
       reject-transit-gateway-peering-attachment -

DESCRIPTION
       Rejects a transit gateway peering attachment request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            reject-transit-gateway-peering-attachment
          --transit-gateway-attachment-id <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --transit-gateway-attachment-id (string)
          The ID of the transit gateway peering attachment.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To reject a transit gateway peering attachment

       The following reject-transit-gateway-peering-attachment example rejects
       the  specified transit gateway peering attachment request. The --region
       parameter specifies the Region that the  accepter  transit  gateway  is
       located in.

          aws ec2 reject-transit-gateway-peering-attachment \
              --transit-gateway-attachment-id tgw-attach-4455667788aabbccd \
              --region us-east-2

       Output:

          {
              "TransitGatewayPeeringAttachment": {
                  "TransitGatewayAttachmentId": "tgw-attach-4455667788aabbccd",
                  "RequesterTgwInfo": {
                      "TransitGatewayId": "tgw-123abc05e04123abc",
                      "OwnerId": "123456789012",
                      "Region": "us-west-2"
                  },
                  "AccepterTgwInfo": {
                      "TransitGatewayId": "tgw-11223344aabbcc112",
                      "OwnerId": "123456789012",
                      "Region": "us-east-2"
                  },
                  "State": "rejecting",
                  "CreationTime": "2019-12-09T11:50:31.000Z"
              }
          }
