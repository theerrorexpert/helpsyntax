CANCEL-SPOT-FLEET-REQUESTS()                      CANCEL-SPOT-FLEET-REQUESTS()



NAME
       cancel-spot-fleet-requests -

DESCRIPTION
       Cancels the specified Spot Fleet requests.

       After  you  cancel a Spot Fleet request, the Spot Fleet launches no new
       Spot Instances. You must specify whether the  Spot  Fleet  should  also
       terminate  its Spot Instances. If you terminate the instances, the Spot
       Fleet request enters the cancelled_terminating  state.  Otherwise,  the
       Spot Fleet request enters the cancelled_running state and the instances
       continue to run until they are interrupted or you terminate them  manu-
       ally.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            cancel-spot-fleet-requests
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          --spot-fleet-request-ids <value>
          --terminate-instances | --no-terminate-instances
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  whether  you  have  the required permissions for the action,
          without actually making the request, and provides an error response.
          If  you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRun-
          Operation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

       --spot-fleet-request-ids (list)
          The IDs of the Spot Fleet requests.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --terminate-instances | --no-terminate-instances (boolean)
          Indicates whether to terminate instances for a Spot Fleet request if
          it is canceled successfully.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To cancel Spot fleet requests

       This  example  command  cancels a Spot fleet request and terminates the
       associated Spot Instances.

       Command:

          aws ec2 cancel-spot-fleet-requests --spot-fleet-request-ids sfr-73fbd2ce-aa30-494c-8788-1cee4EXAMPLE --terminate-instances

       Output:

          {
            "SuccessfulFleetRequests": [
                {
                    "SpotFleetRequestId": "sfr-73fbd2ce-aa30-494c-8788-1cee4EXAMPLE",
                    "CurrentSpotFleetRequestState": "cancelled_running",
                    "PreviousSpotFleetRequestState": "active"
                }
            ],
            "UnsuccessfulFleetRequests": []
