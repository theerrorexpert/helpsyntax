          [--day-of-month <value>]
          [--day-of-week <value>]
          --gateway-arn <value>
          --hour-of-day <value>
          --minute-of-hour <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]

OPTIONS
       --day-of-month (integer)
          The day of the month start maintenance on a gateway.

          Valid values range from Sunday to Saturday .

       --day-of-week (integer)
          The day of the week to start maintenance on a gateway.

       --gateway-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the gateway, used to specify its
          maintenance start time.

       --hour-of-day (integer)
          The hour of the day to start maintenance on a gateway.

       --minute-of-hour (integer)
          The minute of the hour to start maintenance on a gateway.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GatewayArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a gateway for which  you  set  the
          maintenance start time.
