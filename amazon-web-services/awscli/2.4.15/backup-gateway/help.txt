NAME
       backup-gateway -

DESCRIPTION
       Backup  gateway  connects Backup to your hypervisor, so you can create,
       store, and restore backups of your  virtual  machines  (VMs)  anywhere,
       whether  on-premises  or  in  the VMware Cloud (VMC) on Amazon Web Ser-
       vices.

       Add on-premises resources by connecting to a hypervisor through a gate-
       way.  Backup will automatically discover the resources in your hypervi-
       sor.

       Use Backup to assign virtual or on-premises resources to a backup plan,
       or  run  on-demand backups. Once you have backed up your resources, you
       can view them and restore them like any resource supported by Backup.

       To download the Amazon Web Services software to get  started,  navigate
       to the Backup console, choose Gateways , then choose Create gateway .
