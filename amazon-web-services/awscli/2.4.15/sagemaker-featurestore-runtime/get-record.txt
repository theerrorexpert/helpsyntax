NAME
       get-record -

DESCRIPTION
       Use  for  OnlineStore  serving  from  a  FeatureStore . Only the latest
       records stored in the OnlineStore can be retrieved. If no  Record  with
       RecordIdentifierValue is found, then an empty result is returned.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-record
          --feature-group-name <value>
          --record-identifier-value-as-string <value>
          [--feature-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --feature-group-name (string)
          The  name of the feature group in which you want to put the records.

       --record-identifier-value-as-string (string)
          The value that corresponds to  RecordIdentifier  type  and  uniquely
          identifies the record in the FeatureGroup .

       --feature-names (list)
          List  of  names  of  Features to be retrieved. If not specified, the
          latest value for all the Features are returned.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Record -> (list)
          The record you requested. A list of FeatureValues .

          (structure)
              The value associated with a feature.

              FeatureName -> (string)
                 The name of a feature that a feature value corresponds to.

              ValueAsString -> (string)
                 The value associated with a feature, in string  format.  Note
                 that  features  types can be String, Integral, or Fractional.
                 This value represents all three types as a string.
