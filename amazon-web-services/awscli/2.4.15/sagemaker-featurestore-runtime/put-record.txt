SYNOPSIS
            put-record
          --feature-group-name <value>
          --record <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --feature-group-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  feature group that you want to insert the record
          into.

       --record (list)
          List  of  FeatureValues  to  be  inserted.  This  will  be  a   full
          over-write. If you only want to update few of the feature values, do
          the following:

          o Use GetRecord to retrieve the latest record.

          o Update the record returned from GetRecord .

          o Use PutRecord to update feature values.

          (structure)
              The value associated with a feature.

              FeatureName -> (string)
                 The name of a feature that a feature value corresponds to.

              ValueAsString -> (string)
                 The value associated with a feature, in string  format.  Note
                 that  features  types can be String, Integral, or Fractional.
                 This value represents all three types as a string.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FeatureName=string,ValueAsString=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "FeatureName": "string",
              "ValueAsString": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
