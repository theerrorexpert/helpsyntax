SYNOPSIS
            batch-get-record
          --identifiers <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --identifiers (list)
          A list of FeatureGroup names, with their corresponding RecordIdenti-
          fier value,  and  Feature  name  that  have  been  requested  to  be
          retrieved in batch.

          (structure)
              The  identifier  that  identifies  the  batch of Records you are
              retrieving in a batch.

              FeatureGroupName -> (string)
                 A FeatureGroupName containing Records you are retrieving in a
                 batch.

              RecordIdentifiersValueAsString -> (list)
                 The  value for a list of record identifiers in string format.

                 (string)

              FeatureNames -> (list)
                 List of names of Features to be retrieved. If not  specified,
                 the latest value for all the Features are returned.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FeatureGroupName=string,RecordIdentifiersValueAsString=string,string,FeatureNames=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "FeatureGroupName": "string",
              "RecordIdentifiersValueAsString": ["string", ...],
              "FeatureNames": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
