DESCRIBE-ACCELERATORS()                                DESCRIBE-ACCELERATORS()



NAME
       describe-accelerators -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  information over a provided set of accelerators belonging to
       an account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-accelerators is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: acceleratorSet

SYNOPSIS
            describe-accelerators
          [--accelerator-ids <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --accelerator-ids (list)
          The IDs of the accelerators to describe.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          One  or  more  filters.  Filter names and values are case-sensitive.
          Valid filter names are: accelerator-types: can  provide  a  list  of
          accelerator  type  names  to  filter for. instance-id: can provide a
          list of EC2 instance ids to filter for.

          (structure)
              A filter expression for the Elastic Inference Accelerator  list.

              name -> (string)
                 The  filter  name for the Elastic Inference Accelerator list.
                 It can assume the  following  values:  accelerator-type:  the
                 type   of   Elastic  Inference  Accelerator  to  filter  for.
                 instance-id: an EC2 instance id to filter for.

              values -> (list)
                 The values for the filter of the Elastic Inference  Accelera-
                 tor list.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 The  ARN of the resource that the Elastic Inference Accelera-
                 tor is attached to.
