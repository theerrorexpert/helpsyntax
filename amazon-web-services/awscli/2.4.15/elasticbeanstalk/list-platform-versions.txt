LIST-PLATFORM-VERSIONS()                              LIST-PLATFORM-VERSIONS()



NAME
       list-platform-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  platform  versions  available  for  your  account in an AWS
       Region. Provides summary information about each platform version.  Com-
       pare  to  DescribePlatformVersion , which provides full details about a
       single platform version.

       For definitions of platform version and other  platform-related  terms,
       see AWS Elastic Beanstalk Platforms Glossary .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-platform-versions is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: PlatformSummaryList

SYNOPSIS
            list-platform-versions
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Criteria for restricting the resulting list  of  platform  versions.
          The filter is interpreted as a logical conjunction (AND) of the sep-
          arate PlatformFilter terms.

          (structure)
              Describes criteria to restrict the results when listing platform
              versions.

              The filter is evaluated as follows: Type Operator Values[1]

              Type -> (string)
                 The platform version attribute to which the filter values are
                 applied.

                 Valid values: PlatformName | PlatformVersion | PlatformStatus
                 | PlatformBranchName | PlatformLifecycleState | PlatformOwner
                 | SupportedTier | SupportedAddon | ProgrammingLanguageName  |
                 OperatingSystemName

              Operator -> (string)
                 The operator to apply to the Type with each of the Values .

                 Valid  values:  =  |  !=  |  <  |  <=  |  > | >= | contains |
                 begins_with | ends_with

              Values -> (list)
                 The list of values applied to the filtering platform  version
                 attribute. Only one value is supported for all current opera-
                 tors.

                 The following list shows valid filter values for some  filter
                 attributes.

                 o PlatformStatus  :  Creating  |  Failed | Ready | Deleting |
                   Deleted

                 o PlatformLifecycleState : recommended

                 o SupportedTier : WebServer/Standard | Worker/SQS/HTTP

                 o SupportedAddon : Log/S3 | Monitoring/Healthd  |  WorkerDae-
                   mon/SQSD

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string,Operator=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Type": "string",
              "Operator": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PlatformSummaryList -> (list)
          Summary information about the platform versions.

          (structure)
              Summary information about a platform version.

                 The version of the operating system used by the platform ver-
                 sion.

                 Possible values: recommended | empty

                 If  an  empty value is returned, the platform version is sup-
                 ported but isn't the recommended one for its branch.

              PlatformVersion -> (string)
                 The version string of the platform version.

              PlatformBranchName -> (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          In  a  paginated  request, if this value isn't null , it's the token
          that you can pass in a subsequent request to get the  next  response
          page.
