UPDATE-APPLICATION()                                      UPDATE-APPLICATION()



NAME
       update-application -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the specified application to have the specified properties.

       NOTE:
          If a property (for example, description ) is not provided, the value
          remains unchanged. To  clear  these  properties,  specify  an  empty
          string.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-application
          --application-name <value>
          [--description <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  application to update. If no such application is
          found, UpdateApplication returns an InvalidParameterValue error.

       --description (string)
          A new description for the application.

          Default: If not specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk does not update the
          description.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To change an application's description

       The  following  command updates the description of an application named
       my-app:

          aws elasticbeanstalk update-application --application-name my-app --description "my Elastic Beanstalk application"

       Output:

          {
              "Application": {
                  "ApplicationName": "my-app",
                  "Description": "my Elastic Beanstalk application",
                  "Versions": [
                      "2fba-stage-150819_234450",
                      "bf07-stage-150820_214945",
                      "93f8",
                      "fd7c-stage-150820_000431",
                      "22a0-stage-150819_185942"
                  ],
                  "DateCreated": "2015-08-13T19:15:50.449Z",
                  "ConfigurationTemplates": [],
                  "DateUpdated": "2015-08-20T22:34:56.195Z"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       Application -> (structure)
          The  ApplicationDescription of the application.

          ApplicationArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the application.

          ApplicationName -> (string)
              The name of the application.

          Description -> (string)
              User-defined description of the application.

          DateCreated -> (timestamp)
              The date when the application was created.

          DateUpdated -> (timestamp)
              The date when the application was last modified.

          Versions -> (list)
              The names of the versions for this application.

              (string)

          ConfigurationTemplates -> (list)
              The names of the configuration templates  associated  with  this
              application.

              (string)

          ResourceLifecycleConfig -> (structure)
              The lifecycle settings for the application.

              ServiceRole -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of  an  IAM service role that Elastic Beanstalk has
                 permission to assume.

                 The ServiceRole property is required the first time that  you
                 provide  a  VersionLifecycleConfig for the application in one
                 of the supporting calls (CreateApplication or  UpdateApplica-
                 tionResourceLifecycle ). After you provide it once, in either
                 one of the calls, Elastic Beanstalk persists the Service Role
                 with  the application, and you don't need to specify it again
                 in subsequent UpdateApplicationResourceLifecycle  calls.  You
                 can,  however,  specify  it in subsequent calls to change the
                 Service Role to another value.

              VersionLifecycleConfig -> (structure)
                 Defines lifecycle settings for application versions.

                 MaxCountRule -> (structure)
                     Specify a max count rule to restrict the number of appli-
                     cation versions that are retained for an application.

                     Enabled -> (boolean)
                        Specify  true  to  apply the rule, or false to disable
                        it.

                     MaxCount -> (integer)
                        Specify the maximum number of application versions  to
                        retain.

                     DeleteSourceFromS3 -> (boolean)
                        Set  to  true to delete a version's source bundle from
                        Amazon S3 when Elastic Beanstalk deletes the  applica-
                        tion version.

                 MaxAgeRule -> (structure)
                     Specify  a  max  age  rule to restrict the length of time
                     that application versions are retained  for  an  applica-
                     tion.

                     Enabled -> (boolean)
                        Specify  true  to  apply the rule, or false to disable
                        it.

                     MaxAgeInDays -> (integer)
                        Specify the number of days to  retain  an  application
                        versions.

                     DeleteSourceFromS3 -> (boolean)
                        Set  to  true to delete a version's source bundle from
                        Amazon S3 when Elastic Beanstalk deletes the  applica-
                        tion version.
