NAME
       terminate-environment -

DESCRIPTION
       Terminates the specified environment.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            terminate-environment
          [--environment-id <value>]
          [--environment-name <value>]
          [--terminate-resources | --no-terminate-resources]
          [--force-terminate | --no-force-terminate]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --environment-id (string)
          The ID of the environment to terminate.

          Condition:  You  must  specify either this or an EnvironmentName, or
          both. If you do not specify either, AWS  Elastic  Beanstalk  returns
          MissingRequiredParameter error.

       --environment-name (string)
          The name of the environment to terminate.

          Condition:  You  must  specify  either  this or an EnvironmentId, or
          both. If you do not specify either, AWS  Elastic  Beanstalk  returns
          MissingRequiredParameter error.

       --terminate-resources | --no-terminate-resources (boolean)
          Indicates whether the associated AWS resources should shut down when
          the environment is terminated:

          o true : The specified environment as well  as  the  associated  AWS
            resources, such as Auto Scaling group and LoadBalancer, are termi-
            nated.

          o false : AWS Elastic Beanstalk resource management is removed  from
            the environment, but the AWS resources continue to operate.

          For more information, see the AWS Elastic Beanstalk User Guide.

          Default: true

          Valid Values: true | false

       --force-terminate | --no-force-terminate (boolean)
          Terminates the target environment even if another environment in the
          same group is dependent on it.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
