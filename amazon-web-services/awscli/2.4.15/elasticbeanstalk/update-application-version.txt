DESCRIPTION
       Updates the specified application version to have the specified proper-
       ties.

          If a property (for example, description ) is not provided, the value
          remains unchanged. To clear properties, specify an empty string.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-application-version
          --application-name <value>
          --version-label <value>
          [--description <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          The name of the application associated with this version.

          If no application is found with this name, UpdateApplication returns
          an InvalidParameterValue error.

       --version-label (string)
          The name of the version to update.

          If no application version is found with this  label,  UpdateApplica-
          tion returns an InvalidParameterValue error.

       --description (string)
          A new description for this version.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
