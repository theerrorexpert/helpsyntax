DISASSOCIATE-ENVIRONMENT-OPERATIONS-DISASSOCIATE-ENVIRONMENT-OPERATIONS-ROLE()



NAME
       disassociate-environment-operations-role -

DESCRIPTION
       Disassociate  the  operations role from an environment. After this call
       is made, Elastic Beanstalk uses the caller's  permissions  for  permis-
       sions  to  downstream  services  during subsequent calls acting on this
       environment. For more information, see  Operations  roles  in  the  AWS
       Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disassociate-environment-operations-role
          --environment-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --environment-name (string)
          The  name  of  the environment from which to disassociate the opera-
          tions role.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
