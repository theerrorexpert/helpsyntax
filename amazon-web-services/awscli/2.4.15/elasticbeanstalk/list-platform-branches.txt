NAME
       list-platform-branches -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  platform  branches  available  for  your  account in an AWS
       Region. Provides summary information about each platform branch.

       For definitions of platform branch and  other  platform-related  terms,
       see AWS Elastic Beanstalk Platforms Glossary .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-platform-branches
          [--filters <value>]
          [--max-records <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Criteria  for  restricting  the resulting list of platform branches.
          The filter is evaluated as a logical conjunction (AND) of the  sepa-
          rate SearchFilter terms.

          The  following  list  shows  valid  attribute values for each of the
          SearchFilter terms. Most operators take a single value. The  in  and
          not_in operators can take multiple values.

          o Attribute = BranchName :

            o Operator  :  =  | != | begins_with | ends_with | contains | in |
              not_in

          o Attribute = LifecycleState :

            o Operator : = | != | in | not_in

            o Values : beta | supported | deprecated | retired

          o Attribute = PlatformName :

            o Operator : = | != | begins_with | ends_with | contains  |  in  |
              not_in

          o Attribute = TierType :

            o Operator : = | !=

            o Values : WebServer/Standard | Worker/SQS/HTTP

          Array size: limited to 10 SearchFilter objects.

          Within  each  SearchFilter  item,  the Values array is limited to 10
          items.

          (structure)
              Describes criteria to restrict a list of results.

              For operators that apply a single value to  the  attribute,  the
              filter is evaluated as follows: Attribute Operator Values[1]

              Some  operators,  e.g.  in  , can apply multiple values. In this
              case, the filter is evaluated as a logical union (OR) of  appli-
              cations  of  the  operator to the attribute with each one of the
              values: (Attribute Operator Values[1])  OR  (Attribute  Operator
              Values[2]) OR ...

              The  valid  values  for attributes of SearchFilter depend on the
              API action. For valid values, see the reference page for the API
              action you're calling that takes a SearchFilter parameter.

              Attribute -> (string)
                 The  result attribute to which the filter values are applied.
                 Valid values vary by API action.

              Operator -> (string)
                 The operator to apply to the Attribute with each of the  Val-
                 ues . Valid values vary by Attribute .

              Values -> (list)
                 The  list  of  values  applied  to the Attribute and Operator
                 attributes.  Number  of  values  and  valid  values  vary  by
                 Attribute .

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Attribute=string,Operator=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Attribute": "string",
              "Operator": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-records (integer)
          The maximum number of platform branch values returned in one call.

       --next-token (string)
          For  a  paginated  request. Specify a token from a previous response
          page to retrieve the next response page. All other parameter  values
          must be identical to the ones specified in the initial request.

          If no NextToken is specified, the first page is retrieved.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PlatformBranchSummaryList -> (list)
          Summary information about the platform branches.

          (structure)
              Summary information about a platform branch.

              PlatformName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  platform  to  which  this platform branch
                 belongs.

              BranchName -> (string)
                 The name of the platform branch.

              LifecycleState -> (string)
                 The support life cycle state of the platform branch.

                 Possible values: beta | supported | deprecated | retired

              BranchOrder -> (integer)
                 An ordinal number that designates the order in which platform
                 branches  have been added to a platform. This can be helpful,
                 for example, if  your  code  calls  the  ListPlatformBranches
                 action and then displays a list of platform branches.

                 A larger BranchOrder value designates a newer platform branch
                 within the platform.

              SupportedTierList -> (list)
                 The environment tiers that platform versions in  this  branch
                 support.

                 Possible values: WebServer/Standard | Worker/SQS/HTTP

                 (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          In  a  paginated  request, if this value isn't null , it's the token
          that you can pass in a subsequent request to get the  next  response
          page.
