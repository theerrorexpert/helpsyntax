DESCRIBE-APPLICATIONS()                                DESCRIBE-APPLICATIONS()



NAME
       describe-applications -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the descriptions of existing applications.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-applications
          [--application-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-names (list)
          If  specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the returned descrip-
          tions to only include those with the specified names.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To view a list of applications

       The following command retrieves information about applications  in  the
       current region:

          aws elasticbeanstalk describe-applications

       Output:

OUTPUT
       Applications -> (list)
          This parameter contains a list of  ApplicationDescription .

          (structure)
              Describes the properties of an application.

              ApplicationArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the application.

              ApplicationName -> (string)
                 The name of the application.

              Description -> (string)
                 User-defined description of the application.

              DateCreated -> (timestamp)
                 The date when the application was created.

              DateUpdated -> (timestamp)
                 The date when the application was last modified.

              Versions -> (list)
                 The names of the versions for this application.

                 (string)

              ConfigurationTemplates -> (list)
                 The names of the configuration templates associated with this
                 application.

                 (string)

              ResourceLifecycleConfig -> (structure)
                 The lifecycle settings for the application.

                 ServiceRole -> (string)
                     The ARN of an IAM service role that Elastic Beanstalk has
                     permission to assume.

                     The  ServiceRole property is required the first time that
                     you provide a VersionLifecycleConfig for the  application
                     in  one  of  the  supporting  calls (CreateApplication or
                     UpdateApplicationResourceLifecycle ). After  you  provide
                     it  once,  in  either one of the calls, Elastic Beanstalk
                     persists the Service Role with the application,  and  you
                     don't need to specify it again in subsequent UpdateAppli-
                     cationResourceLifecycle calls. You can, however,  specify
                     it  in  subsequent  calls  to  change the Service Role to
                     another value.

                 VersionLifecycleConfig -> (structure)
                     Defines lifecycle settings for application versions.

                     MaxCountRule -> (structure)
                        Specify a max count rule to  restrict  the  number  of
                        application versions that are retained for an applica-
                        tion.

                        Enabled -> (boolean)
                            Specify true to apply the rule, or false  to  dis-
                            able it.

                        MaxCount -> (integer)
                            Specify the maximum number of application versions
                            to retain.

                        DeleteSourceFromS3 -> (boolean)
                            Set to true to delete a  version's  source  bundle
                            from  Amazon S3 when Elastic Beanstalk deletes the
                            application version.

                     MaxAgeRule -> (structure)
                        Specify a max age rule to restrict the length of  time
                        that application versions are retained for an applica-
                        tion.

                        Enabled -> (boolean)
                            Specify true to apply the rule, or false  to  dis-
                            able it.

                        MaxAgeInDays -> (integer)
                            Specify  the  number of days to retain an applica-
                            tion versions.

                        DeleteSourceFromS3 -> (boolean)
                            Set to true to delete a  version's  source  bundle
                            from  Amazon S3 when Elastic Beanstalk deletes the
                            application version.
