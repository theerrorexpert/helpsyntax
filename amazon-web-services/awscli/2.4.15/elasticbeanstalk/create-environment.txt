OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          The name of the application that is associated  with  this  environ-
          ment.

       --environment-name (string)
          A unique name for the environment.

          Constraint:  Must be from 4 to 40 characters in length. The name can
          contain only letters, numbers, and hyphens. It can't  start  or  end
          with  a  hyphen.  This  name  must be unique within a region in your
          account. If the specified name already exists in the region, Elastic
          Beanstalk returns an InvalidParameterValue error.

          If you don't specify the CNAMEPrefix parameter, the environment name
          becomes part of the CNAME, and therefore part of the visible URL for
          your application.

       --group-name (string)
          The name of the group to which the target environment belongs. Spec-
          ify a group name only if the environment's name is specified  in  an
          environment  manifest  and  not with the environment name parameter.
          See Environment Manifest (env.yaml) for details.

       --description (string)
          Your description for this environment.

       --cname-prefix (string)
          If specified, the environment attempts to use this value as the pre-
          fix  for the CNAME in your Elastic Beanstalk environment URL. If not
          specified, the CNAME is generated automatically by appending a  ran-
          dom alphanumeric string to the environment name.

       --tier (structure)
          Specifies the tier to use in creating this environment. The environ-
          ment tier that you choose determines whether Elastic Beanstalk  pro-
          visions  resources to support a web application that handles HTTP(S)
          requests or a web  application  that  handles  background-processing
          tasks.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of this environment tier.

              Valid values:

              o For Web server tier  WebServer

              o For Worker tier  Worker

          Type -> (string)
              The type of this environment tier.

              Valid values:

              o For Web server tier  Standard

              o For Worker tier  SQS/HTTP

          Version -> (string)
              The version of this environment tier. When you don't set a value
              to it, Elastic Beanstalk uses the latest compatible worker  tier
              version.

              NOTE:
                 This  member is deprecated. Any specific version that you set
                 may become out of date. We recommend leaving it  unspecified.

       --operations-role (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an existing IAM role to be used as

          uses the operations role for permissions to downstream services dur-
          ing  this  call  and during subsequent calls acting on this environ-
          ment. To specify an operations role, you must have the  iam:PassRole
          permission  for the role. For more information, see Operations roles
          in the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a new environment for an application

       The following command creates a new environment for version "v1"  of  a
       java application named "my-app":

          aws elasticbeanstalk create-environment --application-name my-app --environment-name my-env --cname-prefix my-app --version-label v1 --solution-stack-name "64bit Amazon Linux 2015.03 v2.0.0 running Tomcat 8 Java 8"

       Output:

          {
            "ApplicationName": "my-app",
            "EnvironmentName": "my-env",
            "VersionLabel": "v1",
            "Status": "Launching",
            "EnvironmentId": "e-izqpassy4h",
            "SolutionStackName": "64bit Amazon Linux 2015.03 v2.0.0 running Tomcat 8 Java 8",
            "CNAME": "my-app.elasticbeanstalk.com",
            "Health": "Grey",
            "Tier": {
                "Type": "Standard",
                "Name": "WebServer",
                "Version": " "
            },
            "DateUpdated": "2015-02-03T23:04:54.479Z",
            "DateCreated": "2015-02-03T23:04:54.479Z"
          }

       v1  is  the  label  of  an application version previously uploaded with
       create-application-version.

       To specify a JSON file to define environment configuration options

       The following create-environment command specifies  that  a  JSON  file
       with the name myoptions.json should be used to override values obtained
       from the solution stack or the configuration template:

          aws elasticbeanstalk create-environment --environment-name sample-env --application-name sampleapp --option-settings file://myoptions.json

       myoptions.json is a JSON object defining several settings:

          [
            {
              "Namespace": "aws:elb:healthcheck",
              "OptionName": "Interval",
              "Value": "15"
            },
            {
              "Namespace": "aws:elb:healthcheck",
              "OptionName": "Timeout",
              "Value": "8"
            },
            {
              "Namespace": "aws:elb:healthcheck",
              "OptionName": "HealthyThreshold",
              "Value": "2"
            },
            {
              "Namespace": "aws:elb:healthcheck",
              "OptionName": "UnhealthyThreshold",
              "Value": "3"
            }
          ]

       Developer Guide.
