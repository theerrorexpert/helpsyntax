NAME
       describe-environments -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns descriptions for existing environments.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-environments  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Environments

SYNOPSIS
            describe-environments
          [--application-name <value>]
          [--version-label <value>]
          [--environment-ids <value>]
          [--environment-names <value>]
          [--include-deleted | --no-include-deleted]
          [--included-deleted-back-to <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          If specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the returned  descrip-
          tions  to  include only those that are associated with this applica-
          tion.

       --version-label (string)
          If specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the returned  descrip-
          tions  to  include only those that are associated with this applica-
          tion version.

       --environment-ids (list)
          If specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the returned  descrip-
          tions to include only those that have the specified IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --environment-names (list)
          If  specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the returned descrip-
          tions to include only those that have the specified names.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --include-deleted | --no-include-deleted (boolean)
          Indicates whether to include deleted environments:
              true : Environments that have been deleted after  IncludedDelet-
              edBackTo are displayed.

              false : Do not include deleted environments.

       --included-deleted-back-to (timestamp)
          If  specified when IncludeDeleted is set to true , then environments
          deleted after this date are displayed.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                   functional.

                 o Grey : Default health for a new environment.  The  environ-
                   ment  is  not  fully  launched  and  health checks have not

                     ment's manifest. Links provide connection information  in
                     system  properties that can be used to connect to another
                     environment in the same group. See  Environment  Manifest

                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  environment's  opera-
                 tions role. For more information, see Operations roles in the
                 AWS Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide .
