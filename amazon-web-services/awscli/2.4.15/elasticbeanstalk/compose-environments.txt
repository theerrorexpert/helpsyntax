COMPOSE-ENVIRONMENTS()                                  COMPOSE-ENVIRONMENTS()



NAME
       compose-environments -

DESCRIPTION
       Create  or update a group of environments that each run a separate com-
       ponent of a single application. Takes a list  of  version  labels  that
       specify application source bundles for each of the environments to cre-
       ate or update. The name of each environment and other required informa-
       tion  must be included in the source bundles in an environment manifest
       named env.yaml . See Compose Environments for details.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            compose-environments
          [--application-name <value>]
          [--group-name <value>]
          [--version-labels <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          The name of the application to which the  specified  source  bundles
          belong.

       --group-name (string)
          The name of the group to which the target environments belong. Spec-
          ify a group name only if the environment name defined in each target
          environment's   manifest   ends  with  a  +  (plus)  character.  See
          Environment Manifest (env.yaml) for details.

       --version-labels (list)
          A list of version labels, specifying one or more application  source
          bundles  that  belong  to the target application. Each source bundle
          must include an environment manifest that specifies the name of  the
          environment  and  the name of the solution stack to use, and option-
          ally can specify environment links to create.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                   functional.

                 o Grey : Default health for a new environment.  The  environ-
                   ment  is  not  fully  launched  and  health checks have not
