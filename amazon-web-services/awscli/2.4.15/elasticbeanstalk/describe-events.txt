DESCRIBE-EVENTS()                                            DESCRIBE-EVENTS()



NAME
       describe-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  list  of event descriptions matching criteria up to the last 6
       weeks.

       NOTE:
          This action returns the most recent 1,000 events from the  specified
          NextToken .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-events  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Events

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          If specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the returned  descrip-
          tions to include only those associated with this application.

       --version-label (string)
          If  specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the returned descrip-
          tions to those associated with this application version.

       --template-name (string)
          If specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the returned  descrip-
          tions  to those that are associated with this environment configura-
          tion.

       --environment-id (string)
          If specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the returned  descrip-
          tions to those associated with this environment.

       --environment-name (string)
          If  specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the returned descrip-
          tions to those associated with this environment.

       --platform-arn (string)
          The ARN of a custom platform  version.  If  specified,  AWS  Elastic
          Beanstalk  restricts  the  returned descriptions to those associated
          with this custom platform version.

       --request-id (string)
          If specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the  described  events
          to include only those associated with this request ID.

       --severity (string)
          If  specified,  limits the events returned from this call to include
          only those with the specified severity or higher.

          Possible values:

          o TRACE

          o DEBUG

          o INFO

          o WARN

          o ERROR

          o FATAL

       --start-time (timestamp)
          If specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the returned  descrip-
          tions to those that occur on or after this time.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          If  specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the returned descrip-
          tions to those that occur up to, but not including, the EndTime .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To view events for an environment

       The following command retrieves events for an environment named my-env:

          aws elasticbeanstalk describe-events --environment-name my-env
