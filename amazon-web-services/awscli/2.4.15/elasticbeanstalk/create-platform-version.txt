OPTIONS
       --platform-name (string)
          The name of your custom platform.

       --platform-version (string)
          The number, such as 1.0.2, for the new platform version.

       --platform-definition-bundle (structure)
          The location of the platform definition archive in Amazon S3.

              The Amazon S3 bucket where the data is located.

          S3Key -> (string)
              The Amazon S3 key where the data is located.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Bucket=string,S3Key=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Bucket": "string",
            "S3Key": "string"
          }

       --environment-name (string)
          The name of the builder environment.

       --option-settings (list)
          The  configuration  option settings to apply to the builder environ-
          ment.

          (structure)
              A specification identifying an individual  configuration  option
              along  with its current value. For a list of possible namespaces
              and  option  values,  see  Option  Values  in  the  AWS  Elastic
              Beanstalk Developer Guide .

              ResourceName -> (string)
                 A  unique  resource name for the option setting. Use it for a
                 timebased scaling configuration option.

              Namespace -> (string)
                 A unique namespace that identifies  the  option's  associated
                 AWS resource.

              OptionName -> (string)
                 The name of the configuration option.

              Value -> (string)
                 The current value for the configuration option.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ResourceName=string,Namespace=string,OptionName=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ResourceName": "string",
              "Namespace": "string",
              "OptionName": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --tags (list)
          Specifies the tags applied to the new platform version.

          Elastic  Beanstalk  applies these tags only to the platform version.
          Environments that  you  create  using  the  platform  version  don't
          inherit the tags.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag applied to a resource in an environment.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              If an empty value is returned, the platform version is supported
              but isn't the recommended one for its branch.
