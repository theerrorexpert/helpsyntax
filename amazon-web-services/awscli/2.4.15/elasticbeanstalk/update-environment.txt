UPDATE-ENVIRONMENT()                                      UPDATE-ENVIRONMENT()



NAME
       update-environment -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the environment description, deploys a new application version,
       updates the configuration settings to  an  entirely  new  configuration
       template,  or updates select configuration option values in the running
       environment.

       Attempting to update both the release and configuration is not  allowed
       and AWS Elastic Beanstalk returns an InvalidParameterCombination error.

       When updating the configuration settings to a new template or  individ-
       ual  settings, a draft configuration is created and  DescribeConfigura-
       tionSettings for this environment returns two setting descriptions with
       different DeploymentStatus values.

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          The  name  of  the application with which the environment is associ-
          ated.

       --environment-id (string)
          The ID of the environment to update.

          If no environment with this ID exists, AWS Elastic Beanstalk returns
          an InvalidParameterValue error.

          Condition:  You  must  specify either this or an EnvironmentName, or
          both. If you do not specify either, AWS  Elastic  Beanstalk  returns
          MissingRequiredParameter error.

       --environment-name (string)
          The  name  of the environment to update. If no environment with this
          name exists, AWS Elastic Beanstalk returns an  InvalidParameterValue
          error.

          Condition:  You  must  specify  either  this or an EnvironmentId, or
          both. If you do not specify either, AWS  Elastic  Beanstalk  returns
          MissingRequiredParameter error.

       --group-name (string)
          The name of the group to which the target environment belongs. Spec-
          ify a group name only if the environment's name is specified  in  an
          environment  manifest  and not with the environment name or environ-
          ment ID parameters. See Environment Manifest (env.yaml) for details.

       --description (string)
          If  this  parameter  is specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk updates the
          description of this environment.

       --tier (structure)
          This specifies the tier to use to update the environment.

          Condition: At this time, if you change the tier  version,  name,  or
          type, AWS Elastic Beanstalk returns InvalidParameterValue error.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of this environment tier.

              Valid values:

              o For Web server tier  WebServer

              o For Worker tier  Worker

          Type -> (string)
              The type of this environment tier.

              Valid values:

              o For Worker tier  SQS/HTTP

          Version -> (string)
              The version of this environment tier. When you don't set a value
              to it, Elastic Beanstalk uses the latest compatible worker  tier
              version.

              NOTE:
                 This  member is deprecated. Any specific version that you set
                 may become out of date. We recommend leaving it  unspecified.

              ResourceName -> (string)
                 A unique resource name for the option setting. Use it  for  a
                 timebased scaling configuration option.

              Namespace -> (string)
                 A  unique  namespace  that identifies the option's associated
                 AWS resource.

              OptionName -> (string)
                 The name of the configuration option.

              Value -> (string)

          ]

       --options-to-remove (list)
          A list of custom user-defined configuration options to  remove  from
          the configuration set for this environment.

          (structure)
              A  specification identifying an individual configuration option.

              ResourceName -> (string)
                 A unique resource name for a time-based scaling configuration
                 option.

          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update an environment to a new version

       The following command updates an environment named "my-env" to  version
       "v2" of the application to which it belongs:

          aws elasticbeanstalk update-environment --environment-name my-env --version-label v2

       This  command requires that the "my-env" environment already exists and
       belongs to an application that has a valid application version with the
       label "v2".

       Output:

          {
            "ApplicationName": "my-app",
            "EnvironmentName": "my-env",
            "VersionLabel": "v2",
            "Status": "Updating",
            "EnvironmentId": "e-szqipays4h",
            "EndpointURL": "awseb-e-i-AWSEBLoa-1RDLX6TC9VUAO-0123456789.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com",
            "SolutionStackName": "64bit Amazon Linux running Tomcat 7",
            "CNAME": "my-env.elasticbeanstalk.com",
            "Health": "Grey",
            "Tier": {
                "Version": " ",
                "Type": "Standard",
                "Name": "WebServer"
            },
            "DateUpdated": "2015-02-03T23:12:29.119Z",
            "DateCreated": "2015-02-03T23:04:54.453Z"
          }

       To set an environment variable

       The  following  command  sets the value of the "PARAM1" variable in the
       "my-env" environment to "ParamValue":

          aws elasticbeanstalk update-environment --environment-name my-env --option-settings Namespace=aws:elasticbeanstalk:application:environment,OptionName=PARAM1,Value=ParamValue

       The option-settings parameter takes a namespace in addition to the name
       and  value  of  the variable. Elastic Beanstalk supports several names-
       paces for options in addition to environment variables.

       To configure option settings from a file

       The following command configures several options in  the  aws:elb:load-
       balancer namespace from a file:

          aws elasticbeanstalk update-environment --environment-name my-env --option-settings file://options.json

       options.json is a JSON object defining several settings:

          [
            {
              "Namespace": "aws:elb:healthcheck",
              "OptionName": "Interval",
              "Value": "15"
            },
            {
              "Namespace": "aws:elb:healthcheck",
              "OptionName": "Timeout",
              "Value": "8"
            },
            {
              "Namespace": "aws:elb:healthcheck",
              "OptionName": "HealthyThreshold",
              "Value": "2"
            },
            {
              "Namespace": "aws:elb:healthcheck",
              "OptionName": "UnhealthyThreshold",
              "Value": "3"
            }
          ]

       Output:

          {
              "ApplicationName": "my-app",
              "EnvironmentName": "my-env",
              "VersionLabel": "7f58-stage-150812_025409",
              "Status": "Updating",
              "EnvironmentId": "e-wtp2rpqsej",
              "EndpointURL": "awseb-e-w-AWSEBLoa-14XB83101Q4L-104QXY80921.sa-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com",
              "SolutionStackName": "64bit Amazon Linux 2015.03 v2.0.0 running Tomcat 8 Java 8",
              "CNAME": "my-env.elasticbeanstalk.com",
              "Health": "Grey",
              "AbortableOperationInProgress": true,
              "Tier": {
                  "Version": " ",
                  "Type": "Standard",
                  "Name": "WebServer"
              },
              "DateUpdated": "2015-08-12T18:15:23.804Z",
              "DateCreated": "2015-08-07T20:48:49.599Z"
          }
