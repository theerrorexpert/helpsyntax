DESCRIBE-ENVIRONMENT-HEALTH()                    DESCRIBE-ENVIRONMENT-HEALTH()



NAME
       describe-environment-health -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about the overall health of the specified environ-
       ment. The DescribeEnvironmentHealth operation is  only  available  with
       AWS Elastic Beanstalk Enhanced Health.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-environment-health
          [--environment-name <value>]
          [--environment-id <value>]
          [--attribute-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --environment-name (string)
          Specify the environment by name.

          You must specify either this or an EnvironmentName, or both.

       --environment-id (string)
          Specify the environment by ID.

          You must specify either this or an EnvironmentName, or both.

       --attribute-names (list)
          Specify the response elements to return. To retrieve all attributes,
          set to All . If no attribute names are specified, returns  the  name
          of the environment.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            Status
            Color
            Causes
            ApplicationMetrics
            InstancesHealth
            All
            HealthStatus
            RefreshedAt

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To view environment health

       The following command retrieves overall health information for an envi-
       ronment named my-env:

          aws elasticbeanstalk describe-environment-health --environment-name my-env --attribute-names All

       Output:
