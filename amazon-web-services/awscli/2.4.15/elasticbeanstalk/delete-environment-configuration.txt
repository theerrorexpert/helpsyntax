NAME
       delete-environment-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the  draft  configuration associated with the running environ-
       ment.

       Updating a running environment with any configuration changes creates a
       draft  configuration  set.  You  can  get the draft configuration using
       DescribeConfigurationSettings while the update is in progress or if the
       update  fails.  The  DeploymentStatus for the draft configuration indi-
       cates whether the deployment is in process or  has  failed.  The  draft
       configuration  remains  in  existence  until  it  is  deleted with this
       action.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-environment-configuration
          --application-name <value>
          --environment-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          The name of the application the environment is associated with.

       --environment-name (string)
          The name of the environment to delete the draft configuration  from.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
