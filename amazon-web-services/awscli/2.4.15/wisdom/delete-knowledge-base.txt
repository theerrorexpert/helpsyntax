DELETE-KNOWLEDGE-BASE()                                DELETE-KNOWLEDGE-BASE()



NAME
       delete-knowledge-base -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the knowledge base.

       NOTE:
          When  you  use this API to delete an external knowledge base such as
          Salesforce or ServiceNow, you must also delete the  Amazon  AppInte-
          grations  DataIntegration.  This  is  because  you  can't  reuse the
          DataIntegration after it's been associated with an  external  knowl-
          edge   base.   However,   you   can  delete  and  recreate  it.  See
          DeleteDataIntegration and CreateDataIntegration in the Amazon AppIn-
          tegrations API Reference .

SYNOPSIS
            delete-knowledge-base
          --knowledge-base-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --knowledge-base-id (string)
          The  knowledge  base to delete content from. Can be either the ID or
          the ARN. URLs cannot contain the ARN.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
