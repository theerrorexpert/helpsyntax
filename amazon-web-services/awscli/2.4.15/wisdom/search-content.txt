SEARCH-CONTENT()                                              SEARCH-CONTENT()



NAME
       search-content -

DESCRIPTION
       Searches  for content in a specified knowledge base. Can be used to get
       a specific content resource by its name.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       search-content is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: contentSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            search-content
          --knowledge-base-id <value>
          --search-expression <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --knowledge-base-id (string)
          The  the  identifier  of the knowledge base. Can be either the ID or
          the ARN. URLs cannot contain the ARN.

       --search-expression (structure)
          The search expression to filter results.

          filters -> (list)
              The search expression filters.

              (structure)
                 A search filter.

                 field -> (string)
                     The field on which to filter.

                 operator -> (string)
                     The operator to use for comparing the fields  value  with
                     the provided value.

                 value -> (string)
                     The desired field value on which to filter.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          filters=[{field=string,operator=string,value=string},{field=string,operator=string,value=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "filters": [
              {
                "field": "NAME",
                "operator": "EQUALS",
                "value": "string"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          Summary information about the content.

                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the content.

              contentId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the content.

              contentType -> (string)

                 A key/value map to store attributes without affecting tagging
                 or  recommendations.  For  example,  when  synchronizing data
                 between an external system  and  Wisdom,  you  can  store  an
                 external version identifier as metadata to utilize for deter-
                 mining drift.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the content.

              tags -> (map)
                 The tags used to organize, track, or control access for  this
                 resource.

          of results.
