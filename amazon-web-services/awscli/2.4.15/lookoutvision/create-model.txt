CREATE-MODEL()                                                  CREATE-MODEL()



NAME
       create-model -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new version of a model within an an Amazon Lookout for Vision
       project. CreateModel is an asynchronous operation in which Amazon Look-
       out for Vision trains, tests, and evaluates a new version of a model.

       To  get  the  current  status,  check  the Status field returned in the
       response from  DescribeModel .

       If the project has a single dataset, Amazon Lookout for  Vision  inter-
       nally  splits  the  dataset to create a training and a test dataset. If
       the project has a training and a test dataset, Lookout for Vision  uses
       the respective datasets to train and test the model.

       After  training  completes,  the  evaluation  metrics are stored at the
       location specified in OutputConfig .

       This operation requires permissions to perform  the  lookoutvision:Cre-
       ateModel  operation.  If  you  want to tag your model, you also require
       permission to the lookoutvision:TagResource operation.

SYNOPSIS
            create-model
          --project-name <value>
          [--description <value>]
          [--client-token <value>]
          --output-config <value>
          [--kms-key-id <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --project-name (string)
          The name of the project in which you want to create a model version.

       --description (string)
          A description for the version of the model.

       --client-token (string)
          ClientToken  is  an idempotency token that ensures a call to Create-
          Model completes only once. You choose the value to pass.  For  exam-
          ple, An issue might prevent you from getting a response from Create-
          Model . In this case, safely retry your call to CreateModel by using
          the same ClientToken parameter value.

          If  you  don't  supply a value for ClientToken , the AWS SDK you are
          using inserts a value for you. This prevents retries after a network
          error  from  starting multiple training jobs. You'll need to provide
          your own value for other use cases.

          An error occurs if the other input parameters are not the same as in
          the  first  request. Using a different value for ClientToken is con-
          sidered a new call to CreateModel . An idempotency token  is  active
          for 8 hours.

       --output-config (structure)
          The  location  where  Amazon  Lookout  for Vision saves the training
          results.

          S3Location -> (structure)
              The S3 location for the output.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The S3 bucket that contains the training or  model  packaging
                 job  output.  If you are training a model, the bucket must in
                 your AWS account. If you use an S3 bucket for a model packag-
                 ing job, the S3 bucket must be in the same AWS Region and AWS
                 account in which you use AWS IoT Greengrass.

              Prefix -> (string)
                 The path of the folder, within the S3 bucket,  that  contains
                 the output.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Location={Bucket=string,Prefix=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Location": {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Prefix": "string"
            }
          }

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The  identifier  for  your  AWS  KMS key. The key is used to encrypt
          training and test images copied into the service for model training.
          Your  source  images are unaffected. If this parameter is not speci-
          fied, the copied images are encrypted by a key  that  AWS  owns  and
          manages.

       --tags (list)
          A  set  of  tags  (key-value  pairs)  that you want to attach to the
          model.

          (structure)
              A key and value pair that is attached to  the  specified  Amazon
              Lookout for Vision model.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag that is attached to the specified model.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag that is attached to the specified model.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
