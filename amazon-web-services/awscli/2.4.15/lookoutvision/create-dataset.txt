CREATE-DATASET()                                              CREATE-DATASET()



NAME
       create-dataset -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a new dataset in an Amazon Lookout for Vision project. Create-
       Dataset can create a training or a test dataset from  a  valid  dataset
       source (DatasetSource ).

       If  you  want  a single dataset project, specify train for the value of
       DatasetType .

       To have a project with separate training and test datasets,  call  Cre-
       ateDataset  twice.  On  the  first call, specify train for the value of
       DatasetType . On the  second  call,  specify  test  for  the  value  of
       DatasetType .

       This  operation  requires permissions to perform the lookoutvision:Cre-
       ateDataset operation.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-dataset
          --project-name <value>
          --dataset-type <value>
          [--dataset-source <value>]
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --project-name (string)
          The name of the project in which you want to create a dataset.

       --dataset-type (string)
          The type of the dataset. Specify train for a training dataset. Spec-
          ify test for a test dataset.

       --dataset-source (structure)
          The  location  of  the  manifest file that Amazon Lookout for Vision
          uses to create the dataset.

          If you don't specify DatasetSource , an empty dataset is created and
          the  operation  synchronously returns. Later, you can add JSON Lines
          by calling  UpdateDatasetEntries .

          If you specify a value for DataSource , the manifest at the S3 loca-
          tion  is  validated and used to create the dataset. The call to Cre-
          ateDataset is asynchronous and might take a while  to  complete.  To
          find out the current status, Check the value of Status returned in a
          call to  DescribeDataset .

          GroundTruthManifest -> (structure)
              Location information for the manifest file.

              S3Object -> (structure)
                 The S3 bucket location for the manifest file.

                 Bucket -> (string)
                     The Amazon S3 bucket that contains the manifest.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The name and location of the manifest  file  withiin  the
                     bucket.

                 VersionId -> (string)
                     The version ID of the bucket.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          GroundTruthManifest={S3Object={Bucket=string,Key=string,VersionId=string}}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "GroundTruthManifest": {
              "S3Object": {
                "Bucket": "string",
                "Key": "string",
                "VersionId": "string"
              }
            }
          }

       --client-token (string)
          ClientToken  is  an idempotency token that ensures a call to Create-
          Dataset completes only once. You choose the value to pass. For exam-
          ple, An issue might prevent you from getting a response from Create-
          Dataset . In this case, safely retry your call to  CreateDataset  by
          using the same ClientToken parameter value.

          If  you  don't  supply a value for ClientToken , the AWS SDK you are
          using inserts a value for you. This prevents retries after a network
          error from making multiple dataset creation requests. You'll need to
          provide your own value for other use cases.

          An error occurs if the other input parameters are not the same as in
          the  first  request. Using a different value for ClientToken is con-
          sidered a new call to CreateDataset . An idempotency token is active
          for 8 hours.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          CreationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The  Unix  timestamp  for the date and time that the dataset was
              created.

              The status for the dataset.
