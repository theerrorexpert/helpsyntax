DESCRIPTION
       Describes an Amazon Lookout for Vision model packaging job.

       This   operation   requires   permissions  to  perform  the  lookoutvi-
       sion:DescribeModelPackagingJob operation.

       For more information, see Using your Amazon Lookout for Vision model on
       an edge device in the Amazon Lookout for Vision Developer Guide.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-model-packaging-job
          --project-name <value>
          --job-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --project-name (string)
          The  name  of the project that contains the model packaging job that
          you want to describe.

       --job-name (string)
          The job name for the model packaging job.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
