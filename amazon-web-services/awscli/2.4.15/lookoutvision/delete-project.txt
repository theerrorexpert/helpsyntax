NAME
       delete-project -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes an Amazon Lookout for Vision project.

       To  delete  a  project, you must first delete each version of the model
       associated with the project. To delete a  model  use  the   DeleteModel
       operation.

       You  also  have to delete the dataset(s) associated with the model. For
       more information, see  DeleteDataset . The  images  referenced  by  the
       training and test datasets aren't deleted.

       This   operation   requires   permissions  to  perform  the  lookoutvi-
       sion:DeleteProject operation.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-project
          --project-name <value>
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --project-name (string)
          The name of the project to delete.

       --client-token (string)
          ClientToken  is  an  idempotency  token  that  ensures  a  call   to
          DeleteProject completes only once. You choose the value to pass. For
          example, An issue might prevent you from  getting  a  response  from
          DeleteProject  .  In this case, safely retry your call to DeletePro-
          ject by using the same ClientToken parameter value.

          If you don't supply a value for ClientToken , the AWS  SDK  you  are
          using inserts a value for you. This prevents retries after a network
          error from making multiple project deletion requests. You'll need to
          provide your own value for other use cases.

          An error occurs if the other input parameters are not the same as in
          the first request. Using a different value for ClientToken  is  con-
          sidered a new call to DeleteProject . An idempotency token is active
          for 8 hours.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ProjectArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the project that was deleted.
