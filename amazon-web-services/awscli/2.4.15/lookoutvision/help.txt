DESCRIPTION
       This  is  the  Amazon  Lookout  for  Vision  API Reference. It provides
       descriptions of actions, data  types,  common  parameters,  and  common
       errors.

       Amazon  Lookout for Vision enables you to find visual defects in indus-
       trial products, accurately and at scale. It  uses  computer  vision  to
       identify  missing  components in an industrial product, damage to vehi-
       cles or structures, irregularities in production lines, and even minus-
       cule  defects in silicon wafers  or any other physical item where qual-
       ity is important such as a missing capacitor on printed circuit boards.
