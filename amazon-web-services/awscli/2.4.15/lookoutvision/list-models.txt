LIST-MODELS()                                                    LIST-MODELS()



NAME
       list-models -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the versions of a model in an Amazon Lookout for Vision project.

       The ListModels operation is eventually consistent. Recent calls to Cre-
       ateModel might take a while to appear in the response from ListProjects
       .

       This operation requires permissions to perform the  lookoutvision:List-
       Models operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-models  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: Models

SYNOPSIS
            list-models
          --project-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --project-name (string)
          The name of the project that contains the model  versions  that  you
          want to list.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Models -> (list)
          A list of model versions in the specified project.

          (structure)
              Describes an Amazon Lookout for Vision model.

              CreationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The unix timestamp for the date and time that the  model  was
                 created.

              ModelVersion -> (string)
                 The version of the model.

              ModelArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the model.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description for the model.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the model.

              StatusMessage -> (string)
                 The status message for the model.

              Performance -> (structure)
                 Performance metrics for the model. Not available until train-
                 ing has successfully completed.

                 F1Score -> (float)
                     The overall F1 score metric for the trained model.

                 Recall -> (float)
                     The overall recall metric value for the trained model.

                 Precision -> (float)
                     The overall precision metric value for the trained model.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response is truncated, Amazon Lookout for Vision returns this
          token that you can use in the subsequent  request  to  retrieve  the
          next set of models.
