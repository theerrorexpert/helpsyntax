START-MODEL-PACKAGING-JOB()                        START-MODEL-PACKAGING-JOB()



NAME
       start-model-packaging-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  an Amazon Lookout for Vision model packaging job. A model pack-
       aging job creates an AWS IoT Greengrass component  for  a  Lookout  for
       Vision model. You can use the component to deploy your model to an edge
       device managed by Greengrass.

       Use the  DescribeModelPackagingJob API to determine the current  status
       of  the job. The model packaging job is complete if the value of Status
       is SUCCEEDED .

       To deploy the component to the target device, use  the  component  name
       and component version with the AWS IoT Greengrass CreateDeployment API.

       This operation requires the following permissions:

       o lookoutvision:StartModelPackagingJobs

       o s3:PutObject

       o s3:GetBucketLocation

       o greengrass:CreateComponentVersion

       o greengrass:DescribeComponent

       o (Optional) greengrass:TagResource . Only required if you want to  tag
         the component.

       For more information, see Using your Amazon Lookout for Vision model on
       an edge device in the Amazon Lookout for Vision Developer Guide.

              CompilerOptions -> (string)
                 Additional compiler options  for  the  Greengrass  component.
                 Currently,  only  NVIDIA  Graphics Processing Units (GPU) are
                 supported.

                 For more information, see  Compiler  options  in  the  Amazon
                 Lookout for Vision Developer Guide.

              TargetDevice -> (string)
                 The target device for the model. Currently the only supported
                 value is jetson_xavier . If you specify  TargetDevice  ,  you
                 can't specify TargetPlatform .

              TargetPlatform -> (structure)
                 The target platform for the model. If you specify TargetPlat-
                 form , you can't specify TargetDevice .

                 Os -> (string)
                     The target operating system for the model. Linux  is  the
                     only operating system that is currently supported.

                 Arch -> (string)
                     The target architecture for the model. The currently sup-
                     ported architectures are X86_64 (64-bit  version  of  the
                     x86 instruction set) and ARM_64 (ARMv8 64-bit CPU).

                 Accelerator -> (string)
                     The  target  accelerator  for  the  model. NVIDIA (Nvidia
                     graphics processing unit) is the only accelerator that is
                     currently supported. You must also specify the gpu-code ,
                     trt-ver , and cuda-ver compiler options.

              S3OutputLocation -> (structure)
                 An S3 location in which Lookout for Vision stores the  compo-

                     The S3 bucket that contains the training or model packag-
                     ing job output. If you are training a model,  the  bucket
                     must  in  your AWS account. If you use an S3 bucket for a
                     model packaging job, the S3 bucket must be  in  the  same
                     AWS  Region  and  AWS  account  in  which you use AWS IoT
                     Greengrass.

                 Prefix -> (string)
                     The path of the folder, within the S3 bucket,  that  con-

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Greengrass": {

                }
                ...
              ]
            }
          }

       --description (string)
          A description for the model packaging job.

       --client-token (string)
          ClientToken is an idempotency token that ensures a call to StartMod-
          elPackagingJob completes only once. You choose the  value  to  pass.
          For example, An issue might prevent you from getting a response from
          StartModelPackagingJob . In this case, safely  retry  your  call  to
          StartModelPackagingJob  by  using  the  same  ClientToken  parameter
          value.

          If you don't supply a value for ClientToken , the AWS  SDK  you  are
          using inserts a value for you. This prevents retries after a network
          error from making multiple dataset creation requests. You'll need to
          provide your own value for other use cases.

          An error occurs if the other input parameters are not the same as in
          the first request. Using a different value for ClientToken  is  con-
          sidered  a new call to StartModelPackagingJob . An idempotency token
          is active for 8 hours.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       JobName -> (string)
          The job name for the model packaging job. If you don't supply a  job
          name  in the JobName input parameter, the service creates a job name
          for you.
