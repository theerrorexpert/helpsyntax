CREATE-PROJECT()                                              CREATE-PROJECT()



NAME
       create-project -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  empty  Amazon Lookout for Vision project. After you create
       the project, add a dataset by calling  CreateDataset .

       This operation requires permissions to perform  the  lookoutvision:Cre-
       ateProject operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-project
          --project-name <value>
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --project-name (string)
          The name for the project.

       --client-token (string)
          ClientToken  is  an  idempotency  token  that ensures a call to Cre-
          ateProject completes only once. You choose the value  to  pass.  For
          example,  An  issue  might  prevent you from getting a response from
          CreateProject . In this case, safely retry your call  to  CreatePro-
          ject by using the same ClientToken parameter value.

          If  you  don't  supply a value for ClientToken , the AWS SDK you are
          using inserts a value for you. This prevents retries after a network
          error from making multiple project creation requests. You'll need to
          provide your own value for other use cases.

          An error occurs if the other input parameters are not the same as in
          the  first  request. Using a different value for ClientToken is con-
          sidered a new call to CreateProject . An idempotency token is active
          for 8 hours.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ProjectMetadata -> (structure)
          Information about the project.

          ProjectArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the project.

          ProjectName -> (string)
              The name of the project.

          CreationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The  unix  timestamp  for the date and time that the project was
              created.
