DESCRIBE-MODEL()                                              DESCRIBE-MODEL()



NAME
       describe-model -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes a version of an Amazon Lookout for Vision model.

       This   operation   requires   permissions  to  perform  the  lookoutvi-
       sion:DescribeModel operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-model
          --project-name <value>
          --model-version <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --project-name (string)
          The project that contains the version of a model that  you  want  to
          describe.

       --model-version (string)
          The version of the model that you want to describe.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ModelDescription -> (structure)
          Contains the description of the model.

          ModelVersion -> (string)
              The version of the model

          ModelArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the model.

              ated.

          Description -> (string)
              The description for the model.

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the model.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              The status message for the model.

              Performance metrics for the model. Created during training.

              F1Score -> (float)
                 The overall F1 score metric for the trained model.

              Recall -> (float)
                 The overall recall metric value for the trained model.

              Precision -> (float)
                 The overall precision metric value for the trained model.

          OutputConfig -> (structure)
              The S3 location where Amazon  Lookout  for  Vision  saves  model
              training files.

              S3Location -> (structure)
                 The S3 location for the output.

                 Bucket -> (string)
                     The S3 bucket that contains the training or model packag-
                     ing job output. If you are training a model,  the  bucket
                     must  in  your AWS account. If you use an S3 bucket for a
                     model packaging job, the S3 bucket must be  in  the  same
                     AWS  Region  and  AWS  account  in  which you use AWS IoT
                     Greengrass.

                 Prefix -> (string)
                     The path of the folder, within the S3 bucket,  that  con-
                     tains the output.

          EvaluationManifest -> (structure)
              The  S3 location where Amazon Lookout for Vision saves the mani-
              fest file that was used to test the trained model  and  generate
              the performance scores.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The bucket that contains the training output.

              Key -> (string)
                 The location of the training output in the bucket.

          EvaluationResult -> (structure)
              The  S3  location where Amazon Lookout for Vision saves the per-
              formance metrics.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The bucket that contains the training output.

              Key -> (string)
                 The location of the training output in the bucket.

          EvaluationEndTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The unix timestamp for the date and  time  that  the  evaluation
              ended.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              The  identifer  for the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key
              that was used to encrypt the model during training.
