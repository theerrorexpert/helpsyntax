CREATE-FLEET-LOCATIONS()                              CREATE-FLEET-LOCATIONS()



NAME
       create-fleet-locations -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  remote  locations  to a fleet and begins populating the new loca-
       tions with EC2 instances. The new  instances  conform  to  the  fleet's
       instance type, auto-scaling, and other configuration settings.

       NOTE:
          This  operation cannot be used with fleets that don't support remote
          locations. Fleets can have multiple locations only if they reside in
          AWS Regions that support this feature (see  CreateFleet for the com-
          plete list) and were created after the feature was released in March
          2021.

       To  add  fleet locations, specify the fleet to be updated and provide a
       list of one or more locations.

       If successful, this operation returns the list of added locations  with
       their status set to NEW . GameLift initiates the process of starting an
       instance in each added location. You can track the status of  each  new
       location    by    monitoring    location    creation    events    using
       DescribeFleetEvents . Alternatively, you can poll  location  status  by
       calling   DescribeFleetLocationAttributes  .  After  a  location status
       becomes ACTIVE , you can adjust the location's capacity as needed  with
       UpdateFleetCapacity .

SYNOPSIS
            create-fleet-locations
          --fleet-id <value>
          --locations <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier for the fleet to add locations to. You can use
          either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --locations (list)
          A list of locations to deploy additional instances to and manage  as
          part  of the fleet. You can add any GameLift-supported AWS Region as
          a remote location, in the  form  of  an  AWS  Region  code  such  as
          us-west-2 .

          (structure)
              A  remote  location  where a multi-location fleet can deploy EC2
              instances for game hosting.

              Location -> (string)
                 An AWS Region code, such as us-west-2 .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Location=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Location": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FleetId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet that was updated  with  new  loca-
          tions.

       FleetArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a GameLift fleet
          resource and uniquely identifies it.  ARNs  are  unique  across  all
          Regions.                          Format                          is
          arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912
          .

       LocationStates -> (list)
          The  remote  locations  that  are  being added to the fleet, and the
          life-cycle status of each location. For new locations, the status is
          set  to  NEW . During location creation, GameLift updates each loca-
          tion's status as instances are deployed there and prepared for  game
          hosting.  This  list  does  not include the fleet home Region or any
          remote locations that were already added to the fleet.

          (structure)
              A fleet location and its  life-cycle  state.  A  location  state
              object  might  be  used to describe a fleet's remote location or
              home Region. Life-cycle state tracks the progress  of  launching
              the  first  instance in a new location and preparing it for game
              hosting, and then removing all instances and deleting the  loca-
              tion from the fleet.
