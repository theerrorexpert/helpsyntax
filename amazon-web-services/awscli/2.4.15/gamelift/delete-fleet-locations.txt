DELETE-FLEET-LOCATIONS()                              DELETE-FLEET-LOCATIONS()



NAME
       delete-fleet-locations -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  locations  from  a multi-location fleet. When deleting a loca-
       tion, all game server process and all instances that are  still  active
       in the location are shut down.

       To  delete fleet locations, identify the fleet ID and provide a list of
       the locations to be deleted.

       If successful, GameLift sets the location  status  to  DELETING  ,  and
       begins  to  shut down existing server processes and terminate instances
       in each location being deleted. When  completed,  the  location  status
       changes to TERMINATED .

SYNOPSIS
            delete-fleet-locations
          --fleet-id <value>
          --locations <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier for the fleet to delete locations for. You can
          use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --locations (list)
          The list of fleet locations to delete. Specify locations in the form
          of an AWS Region code, such as us-west-2 .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FleetId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet that location attributes are being
          deleted for.

       FleetArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a GameLift fleet
          resource  and  uniquely  identifies  it.  ARNs are unique across all
          Regions.                          Format                          is
          arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912
          .

       LocationStates -> (list)
          The remote locations that are being deleted, with each location sta-
          tus set to DELETING .

          (structure)
              A  fleet  location  and  its  life-cycle state. A location state
              object might be used to describe a fleet's  remote  location  or
              home  Region.  Life-cycle state tracks the progress of launching
              the first instance in a new location and preparing it  for  game
              hosting,  and then removing all instances and deleting the loca-
              tion from the fleet.

                 us-west-2 .

              Status -> (string)
                 The life-cycle status of a fleet location.
