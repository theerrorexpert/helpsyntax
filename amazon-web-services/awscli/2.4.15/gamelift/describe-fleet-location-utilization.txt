DESCRIBE-FLEET-LOCATION-UTILIZATION()    DESCRIBE-FLEET-LOCATION-UTILIZATION()



NAME
       describe-fleet-location-utilization -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  current  usage  data  for a fleet location. Utilization data
       provides a snapshot of current game hosting activity at  the  requested
       location.  Use this operation to retrieve utilization information for a
       fleet's remote location or home Region  (you  can  also  retrieve  home
       Region utilization by calling DescribeFleetUtilization ).

       To retrieve utilization data, identify a fleet and location.

       If  successful, a FleetUtilization object is returned for the requested
       fleet location.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-fleet-location-utilization
          --fleet-id <value>
          --location <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet to  request  location  utilization
          for. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --location (string)
          The  fleet location to retrieve utilization information for. Specify
          a location in the form of an AWS Region code, such as us-west-2 .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FleetUtilization -> (structure)
          Utilization information for the requested fleet  location.  Utiliza-
          tion  objects  are  returned only for fleets and locations that cur-
          rently exist.

          FleetId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the fleet associated with the  location.

          FleetArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a GameLift
              fleet resource and  uniquely  identifies  it.  ARNs  are  unique
              across          all          Regions.          Format         is
              arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912
              .

          ActiveServerProcessCount -> (integer)
              The  number  of  server processes in ACTIVE status that are cur-
              rently running across all instances in the fleet location.

          ActiveGameSessionCount -> (integer)
              The number of active game  sessions  that  are  currently  being
              hosted across all instances in the fleet location.

          CurrentPlayerSessionCount -> (integer)
              The  number  of  active player sessions that are currently being
              hosted across all instances in the fleet location.

          MaximumPlayerSessionCount -> (integer)
              The maximum number of players allowed across all  game  sessions
              that  are  currently  being  hosted  across all instances in the
              fleet location.

          Location -> (string)
              The  fleet  location  for  the  fleet  utilization  information,
              expressed as an AWS Region code, such as us-west-2 .
