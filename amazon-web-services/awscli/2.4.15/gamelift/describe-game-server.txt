NAME
       describe-game-server -

DESCRIPTION
          This  operation  is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game
          server groups.

       Retrieves  information  for  a  registered  game  server.   Information
       includes  game  server status, health check info, and the instance that
       the game server is running on.

       To retrieve game server information, specify the  game  server  ID.  If
       successful, the requested game server object is returned.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-game-server
          --game-server-group-name <value>
          --game-server-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --game-server-group-name (string)
          A  unique identifier for the game server group where the game server
          is running. Use either the  GameServerGroup name or ARN value.

       --game-server-id (string)
          A custom string that uniquely identifies the game server information
          to be retrieved.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GameServer -> (structure)
          Object that describes the requested game server.

          GameServerGroupName -> (string)
              A  unique  identifier  for  the game server group where the game
              server is running. Use either the  GameServerGroup name  or  ARN
              value.

          GameServerGroupArn -> (string)
              The  ARN  identifier  for  the  game server group where the game
              server is located.

          GameServerId -> (string)
              A custom string that uniquely identifies the game  server.  Game
              server  IDs are developer-defined and are unique across all game
              server groups in an AWS account.

          InstanceId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the instance where the game server  is
              running.  This  ID  is  available  in the instance metadata. EC2
              instance  IDs  use   a   17-character   format,   for   example:
              i-1234567890abcdef0 .

          ConnectionInfo -> (string)
              The  port and IP address that must be used to establish a client
              connection to the game server.

          GameServerData -> (string)
              A set of custom game server properties, formatted  as  a  single
              string  value.  This  data is passed to a game client or service
              when it requests information on game  servers  using   ListGame-
              Servers or  ClaimGameServer .

          ClaimStatus -> (string)
              Indicates  when  an  available game server has been reserved for
              gameplay but has not yet started hosting  a  game.  Once  it  is
              claimed, the game server remains in CLAIMED status for a maximum
              of one minute. During this time, game  clients  connect  to  the
              game  server  to  start  the game and trigger the game server to
              update its utilization status. After one minute, the game server
              claim status reverts to null.

          UtilizationStatus -> (string)
              Indicates whether the game server is currently available for new
              games or is busy. Possible statuses include:

              o AVAILABLE - The game server is available to be claimed. A game
                server  that  has been claimed remains in this status until it
                reports game hosting activity.

              o UTILIZED - The game server is currently hosting a game session
                with players.

          RegistrationTime -> (timestamp)
              Timestamp that indicates when the game server was created with a
              RegisterGameServer request. The format is a number expressed  in
              Unix time as milliseconds (for example "1469498468.057" ).

          LastClaimTime -> (timestamp)
              Timestamp  that  indicates  the  last  time  the game server was
              claimed with a  ClaimGameServer request. The format is a  number
              expressed   in   Unix   time   as   milliseconds   (for  example
              "1469498468.057" ). This value  is  used  to  calculate  when  a
              claimed game server's status should revert to null.

          LastHealthCheckTime -> (timestamp)
              Timestamp  that  indicates  the  last  time  the game server was
              updated with health status using an   UpdateGameServer  request.
              The  format  is  a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds
              (for example "1469498468.057" ). After game server registration,
              this  property  is only changed when a game server update speci-
              fies a health check value.
