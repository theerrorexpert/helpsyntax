LIST-BUILDS()                                                    LIST-BUILDS()



NAME
       list-builds -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  build  resources  for  all  builds  associated  with the AWS
       account in use. You can limit results to builds that are in a  specific
       status  by using the Status parameter. Use the pagination parameters to
       retrieve results in a set of sequential pages.

       NOTE:
              Build resources are not listed in any particular order.

       list-builds  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: Builds

SYNOPSIS
            list-builds
          [--status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --status (string)
          Build status to filter results by. To  retrieve  all  builds,  leave
          this parameter empty.

          Possible build statuses include the following:

          o INITIALIZED  --  A  new  build has been defined, but no files have
            been uploaded. You cannot create fleets for  builds  that  are  in
            this  status. When a build is successfully created, the build sta-
            tus is set to this value.

          o READY -- The game build has been successfully  uploaded.  You  can
            now create new fleets for this build.

          o FAILED  --  The  game  build  upload failed. You cannot create new
            fleets for this build.

          Possible values:

          o INITIALIZED

          o READY

          o FAILED

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example1: To get a list of custom game builds

       The  following  list-builds  example  retrieves properties for all game
       server builds in the current Region. The sample request illustrates how
       to  use the pagination parameters, Limit and NextToken, to retrieve the
       results in sequential sets. The first command retrieves the  first  two
       builds.  Because  there  are  more  than  two  available,  the response
       includes a NextToken to indicate that more results are available.

          aws gamelift list-builds \
              --limit 2

       Output:

          {
              "Builds": [
                  {
                      "BuildArn": "arn:aws:gamelift:us-west-2::build/build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                      "BuildId": "build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                      "CreationTime": 1495664528.723,
                      "Name": "My_Game_Server_Build_One",
                      "OperatingSystem": "WINDOWS_2012",

                      "Status": "READY",
                      "Version": "12345.678"
                  },

                      "BuildId": "build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222",
                      "CreationTime": 1495528748.555,
                      "Name": "My_Game_Server_Build_Two",
                      "OperatingSystem": "AMAZON_LINUX_2",
                      "SizeOnDisk": 8567781,
                      "Status": "FAILED",
                      "Version": "23456.789"
                  }
              ],
              "NextToken": "eyJhd3NBY2NvdW50SWQiOnsicyI6IjMwMjc3NjAxNjM5OCJ9LCJidWlsZElkIjp7InMiOiJidWlsZC01NWYxZTZmMS1jY2FlLTQ3YTctOWI5ZS1iYjFkYTQwMjJEXAMPLE="
          }

       You can then call the command again with the --next-token parameter  as
       follows to see the next two builds.

          aws gamelift list-builds \
              --limit 2
              --next-token eyJhd3NBY2NvdW50SWQiOnsicyI6IjMwMjc3NjAxNjM5OCJ9LCJidWlsZElkIjp7InMiOiJidWlsZC01NWYxZTZmMS1jY2FlLTQ3YTctOWI5ZS1iYjFkYTQwMjJEXAMPLE=

       Repeat until the response doesn't include a NextToken value.

       Example2: To get a list of custom game builds in failure status

       The  following  list-builds  example  retrieves properties for all game
       server builds in the current region that currently have status  FAILED.

          aws gamelift list-builds \
              --status FAILED

       Output:

          {
              "Builds": [
                  {
                      "BuildArn": "arn:aws:gamelift:us-west-2::build/build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222",
                      "BuildId": "build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222",
                      "CreationTime": 1495528748.555,
                      "Name": "My_Game_Server_Build_Two",
                      "OperatingSystem": "AMAZON_LINUX_2",
                      "SizeOnDisk": 8567781,
                      "Status": "FAILED",
                      "Version": "23456.789"
                  }
              ]
          }

              BuildId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the build.

              BuildArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN  )  that  is  assigned  to  a
                 GameLift  build resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are
                 unique      across      all      Regions.      Format      is
                 arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::build/build-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912
                 . In a GameLift build ARN, the resource ID matches the  Buil-
                 dId value.

              Name -> (string)
                 A  descriptive  label  that is associated with a build. Build
                 names do not need to be unique. It can be set using   Create-
                 Build or  UpdateBuild .

              Version -> (string)
                 Version  information  that  is  associated  with  a  build or
                 script. Version strings do not need to be unique. This  value
                 can be set using  CreateBuild or  UpdateBuild .

              Status -> (string)
                 Current status of the build.

                 Possible build statuses include the following:

                 o INITIALIZED  --  A new build has been defined, but no files
                   have been uploaded. You cannot  create  fleets  for  builds
                   that  are in this status. When a build is successfully cre-
                   ated, the build status is set to this value.

                 o READY -- The game build has been successfully uploaded. You
                   can now create new fleets for this build.

                 o FAILED  --  The game build upload failed. You cannot create
                   new fleets for this build.

              SizeOnDisk -> (long)
                 File size of the uploaded game  build,  expressed  in  bytes.
                 When the build status is INITIALIZED , this value is 0.

              OperatingSystem -> (string)
                 Operating  system  that the game server binaries are built to
                 run on. This value determines the  type  of  fleet  resources
                 that you can use for this build.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  time  stamp  indicating when this data object was created.
                 Format is a number expressed in  Unix  time  as  milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates  where to resume retrieving results on the
          next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these  results
          represent the end of the list.
