DESCRIBE-ALIAS()                                              DESCRIBE-ALIAS()



NAME
       describe-alias -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  properties  for  an  alias. This operation returns all alias
       metadata and settings. To get an alias's  target  fleet  ID  only,  use
       ResolveAlias .

       To  get  alias  properties,  specify  the  alias ID. If successful, the
       requested alias record is returned.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-alias
          --alias-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --alias-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the fleet alias that you want to retrieve.
          You can use either the alias ID or ARN value.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Alias -> (structure)
          The requested alias resource.

          AliasId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the alias. Alias IDs are unique within a
              Region.

          Name -> (string)
              A  descriptive  label  that  is  associated with an alias. Alias
              names do not need to be unique.

          AliasArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to  a  GameLift
              alias  resource  and  uniquely  identifies  it.  ARNs are unique
              across         all          Regions.          Format          is
              arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::alias/alias-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912
              . In a GameLift alias ARN, the resource ID matches the alias  ID
              value.

          Description -> (string)
              A human-readable description of an alias.

          RoutingStrategy -> (structure)
              The routing configuration, including routing type and fleet tar-
              get, for the alias.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of routing strategy for the alias.

                 Possible routing types include the following:

                 o SIMPLE - The alias resolves to one specific fleet. Use this
                   type when routing to active fleets.

                 o TERMINAL  -  The  alias  does  not  resolve  to a fleet but
                   instead can be used to display a message  to  the  user.  A
                   terminal  alias  throws  a TerminalRoutingStrategyException
                   with the  RoutingStrategy message embedded.

              FleetId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the fleet that the alias  points  to.
                 This value is the fleet ID, not the fleet ARN.

              Message -> (string)
                 The message text to be used with a terminal routing strategy.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A time stamp indicating when this data object was created.  For-
              mat  is  a  number  expressed  in Unix time as milliseconds (for
              example "1469498468.057" ).

          LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that this data object was last modified.  Format  is  a
              number  expressed  in  Unix  time  as  milliseconds (for example
              "1469498468.057" ).
