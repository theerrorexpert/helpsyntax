DELETE-FLEET()                                                  DELETE-FLEET()



NAME
       delete-fleet -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  all  resources  and  information  related a fleet. Any current
       fleet instances, including those in remote locations,  are  shut  down.
       You don't need to call DeleteFleetLocations separately.

       NOTE:
          If  the  fleet being deleted has a VPC peering connection, you first
          need to get a valid authorization (good for  24  hours)  by  calling
          CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization . You do not need to explicitly delete
          the VPC peering connection--this is done as part of the delete fleet
          process.

       To  delete  a  fleet, specify the fleet ID to be terminated. During the
       deletion process the fleet status is changed to DELETING  .  When  com-
       pleted,   the  status  switches  to  TERMINATED  and  the  fleet  event
       FLEET_DELETED is sent.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-fleet
          --fleet-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet to be deleted. You can use  either
          the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a fleet that is no longer in use

       The following delete-fleet example removes a fleet that has been scaled
       down to zero instances. If the fleet capacity is greater than zero, the
       request fails with an HTTP 400 error.

          aws gamelift delete-fleet \
             --fleet-id fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111

       This command produces no output.

       Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
