DESCRIBE-FLEET-ATTRIBUTES()                        DESCRIBE-FLEET-ATTRIBUTES()



NAME
       describe-fleet-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  core fleet-wide properties, including the computing hardware
       and deployment configuration for all instances in the fleet.

       This operation can be used in the following ways:

       o To get attributes for one or more specific fleets, provide a list  of
         fleet IDs or fleet ARNs.

       o To  get attributes for all fleets, do not provide a fleet identifier.

       When requesting attributes for  multiple  fleets,  use  the  pagination
       parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.

       If  successful,  a  FleetAttributes  object  is returned for each fleet
       requested, unless the fleet identifier is not found.

       NOTE:
              Some API operations limit the number of fleet IDs  that  allowed
              in  one  request.  If  a request exceeds this limit, the request
              fails and the error message contains the maximum allowed number.

       describe-fleet-attributes  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: FleetAttributes

SYNOPSIS
            describe-fleet-attributes
          [--fleet-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-ids (list)
          A list of unique fleet identifiers to retrieve attributes  for.  You
          can use either the fleet ID or ARN value. To retrieve attributes for
          all current fleets, do not include this parameter.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example1: To view attributes for a list of fleets

       The   following   describe-fleet-attributes   example  retrieves  fleet
       attributes for two specified fleets. As shown, the requested fleets are
       deployed  with  the same build, one for On-Demand instances and one for
       Spot instances, with some minor configuration differences.

       Example2: To request attributes for all fleets

       The following describe-fleet-attributes returns  fleet  attributes  for
       all fleets with any status. This example illustrates the use of pagina-
       tion parameters to return one fleet at a time.

          aws gamelift describe-fleet-attributes \
              --limit 1

       Output:

          {
              "FleetAttributes": [

       The output includes a NextToken value that you can use  when  you  call
       the command a second time. Pass the value to the --next-token parameter
       to specify where to pick up the output. The following  command  returns
       the second result in the output.

          aws gamelift describe-fleet-attributes \
              --limit 1 \
              --next-token eyJhd3NBY2NvdW50SWQiOnsicyI6IjMwMjc3NjAxNjM5OCJ9LCJidWlsZElkIjp7InMiOiJidWlsZC01NWYxZTZmMS1jY2FlLTQ3YTctOWI5ZS1iYjFkYTQwMjEXAMPLE1

       Repeat until the response doesn't include a NextToken value.

                 This parameter is no longer used.  Server  launch  parameters
                 are  now  defined  using  the  fleet's   RuntimeConfiguration
                 parameter. Requests that use this parameter instead  continue
                 to be valid.

              LogPaths -> (list)
                     This  parameter is no longer used. Game session log paths
                     are now defined using the GameLift  server  API  Process-
                     Ready()   logParameters  .  See  more  information in the
                     Server API Reference .

              NewGameSessionProtectionPolicy -> (string)
                 The type of  game  session  protection  to  set  on  all  new
                 instances that are started in the fleet.

                 o NoProtection -- The game session can be terminated during a
                   scale-down event.

                 o FullProtection -- If the game session is in an ACTIVE  sta-
                   tus, it cannot be terminated during a scale-down event.

              OperatingSystem -> (string)
                 The  operating  system  of the fleet's computing resources. A
                 fleet's operating system is determined by the OS of the build
                 or script that is deployed on this fleet.

              ResourceCreationLimitPolicy -> (structure)
                 The  fleet  policy that limits the number of game sessions an
                 individual player can create over a span of time.

                 NewGameSessionsPerCreator -> (integer)
                     The maximum number of game sessions  that  an  individual
                     can create during the policy period.

                 PolicyPeriodInMinutes -> (integer)
                     The  time  span  used in evaluating the resource creation
