DESCRIBE-INSTANCES()                                      DESCRIBE-INSTANCES()



NAME
       describe-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information  about  a  fleet's instances, including instance
       IDs, connection data, and status.

       This operation can be used in the following ways:

       o To get information on all instances that are deployed  to  a  fleet's
         home Region, provide the fleet ID.

       o To  get  information  on all instances that are deployed to a fleet's
         remote location, provide the fleet ID and location name.

       o To get information on a specific instance in  a  fleet,  provide  the
         fleet ID and instance ID.

       Use  the  pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequen-
       tial pages.

       If successful, an  Instance  object  is  returned  for  each  requested
       instance. Instances are not returned in any particular order.

       describe-instances is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Instances

SYNOPSIS
            describe-instances
          --fleet-id <value>
          [--instance-id <value>]
          [--location <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier for the fleet to retrieve instance information
          for. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --instance-id (string)
          A unique identifier for an instance to retrieve. Specify an instance
          ID or leave blank to retrieve all instances in the fleet.

       --location (string)
          The  name of a location to retrieve instance information for, in the
          form of an AWS Region code such as us-west-2 .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Instances -> (list)
          A  collection  of  objects  containing  properties for each instance
          returned.

          (structure)
              Represents an EC2 instance of virtual computing  resources  that
              hosts one or more game servers. In GameLift, a fleet can contain
              zero or more instances.

                 unique      across      all      Regions.      Format      is
                 arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912

              IpAddress -> (string)
                 IP address that is assigned to the instance.

              DnsName -> (string)
                 The DNS identifier assigned to the instance that  is  running

                 When connecting to a  game  session  that  is  running  on  a
                 TLS-enabled  fleet,  you  must  use  the DNS name, not the IP
                 address.

              OperatingSystem -> (string)
                 Operating system that is running on this instance.

              Type -> (string)

                 this instance.

              Status -> (string)
                 Current status of the instance. Possible statuses include the
                 following:

                 o PENDING -- The instance is in the process of being  created
                   and  launching  server  processes as defined in the fleet's
                   run-time configuration.

                 o ACTIVE -- The instance has been successfully created and at
                   least  one  server  process  has  successfully launched and
                   reported back to GameLift that it is ready to host  a  game
                   session.  The instance is now considered ready to host game
                   sessions.

                 o TERMINATING -- The instance is in the process  of  shutting
                   down.  This  may happen to reduce capacity during a scaling
                   down event or to recycle resources in the event of a  prob-
                   lem.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  time  stamp  indicating when this data object was created.

                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              Location -> (string)
                 The  fleet  location  of  the  instance,  expressed as an AWS
                 Region code, such as us-west-2 .

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates where to resume  retrieving  results  on  the
          next  call to this operation. If no token is returned, these results
          represent the end of the list.
