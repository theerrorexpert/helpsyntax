SYNOPSIS
            delete-vpc-peering-authorization
          --game-lift-aws-account-id <value>
          --peer-vpc-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --game-lift-aws-account-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the AWS account that you use to manage  your
          GameLift  fleet.  You can find your Account ID in the AWS Management
          Console under account settings.

       --peer-vpc-id (string)
          A unique identifier for a VPC with resources to be accessed by  your
          GameLift fleet. The VPC must be in the same Region as your fleet. To
          look up a VPC ID, use the VPC Dashboard in the AWS  Management  Con-
          sole.  Learn  more  about  VPC  peering in VPC Peering with GameLift
          Fleets .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
