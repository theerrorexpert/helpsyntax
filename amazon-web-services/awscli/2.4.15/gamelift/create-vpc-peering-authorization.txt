CREATE-VPC-PEERING-AUTHORIZATION()          CREATE-VPC-PEERING-AUTHORIZATION()



NAME
       create-vpc-peering-authorization -

DESCRIPTION
       Requests  authorization  to  create or delete a peer connection between
       the VPC for your Amazon GameLift fleet  and  a  virtual  private  cloud
       (VPC) in your AWS account. VPC peering enables the game servers on your
       fleet to communicate directly with other  AWS  resources.  Once  you've
       received  authorization,  call  CreateVpcPeeringConnection to establish
       the peering connection. For more information, see VPC Peering with Ama-
       zon GameLift Fleets .

       You  can  peer  with  VPCs  that  are owned by any AWS account you have
       access to, including the account that you use  to  manage  your  Amazon
       GameLift  fleets.  You  cannot  peer  with  VPCs  that are in different
       Regions.

       To request authorization to create a connection,  call  this  operation
       from  the AWS account with the VPC that you want to peer to your Amazon
       GameLift fleet. For example, to enable your game  servers  to  retrieve
       data  from a DynamoDB table, use the account that manages that DynamoDB
       resource. Identify the following values: (1) The ID of the VPC that you
       want  to  peer  with, and (2) the ID of the AWS account that you use to
       manage Amazon GameLift. If successful, VPC peering  is  authorized  for
       the specified VPC.

       To  request  authorization  to delete a connection, call this operation
       from the AWS account with the VPC  that  is  peered  with  your  Amazon
       GameLift fleet. Identify the following values: (1) VPC ID that you want
       to delete the peering connection for, and (2) ID  of  the  AWS  account
       that you use to manage Amazon GameLift.

       The authorization remains valid for 24 hours unless it is canceled by a
       call to  DeleteVpcPeeringAuthorization . You must create or delete  the
       peering connection while the authorization is valid.

SYNOPSIS
            create-vpc-peering-authorization
          --game-lift-aws-account-id <value>
          --peer-vpc-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --game-lift-aws-account-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the AWS account that you use to manage  your
          GameLift  fleet.  You can find your Account ID in the AWS Management
          Console under account settings.

       --peer-vpc-id (string)
          A unique identifier for a VPC with resources to be accessed by  your
          GameLift fleet. The VPC must be in the same Region as your fleet. To
          look up a VPC ID, use the VPC Dashboard in the AWS  Management  Con-
          sole.  Learn  more  about  VPC  peering in VPC Peering with GameLift
          Fleets .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

          ration.

          GameLiftAwsAccountId -> (string)
              A  unique  identifier for the AWS account that you use to manage

              Management Console under account settings.

          PeerVpcAwsAccountId -> (string)

          PeerVpcId -> (string)
              A  unique  identifier for a VPC with resources to be accessed by
              your GameLift fleet. The VPC must be in the same Region as  your

              Management Console. Learn more about VPC peering in VPC  Peering
              with GameLift Fleets .

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              Time stamp indicating when this authorization was issued. Format
