NAME
       describe-fleet-location-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves   information   on  a  fleet's  remote  locations,  including
       life-cycle status and any suspended fleet activity.

       This operation can be used in the following ways:

       o To get data for specific locations, provide a fleet identifier and  a
         list  of locations. Location data is returned in the order that it is
         requested.

       o To get data for all locations, provide a fleet identifier only. Loca-
         tion data is returned in no particular order.

       When  requesting  attributes for multiple locations, use the pagination
       parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.

       If  successful,  a  LocationAttributes  object  is  returned  for  each
       requested location. If the fleet does not have a requested location, no
       information is returned.  This  operation  does  not  return  the  home
       Region. To get information on a fleet's home Region, call DescribeFlee-
       tAttributes .

SYNOPSIS
            describe-fleet-location-attributes
          --fleet-id <value>
          [--locations <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet to retrieve remote locations  for.
          You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --locations (list)
          A list of fleet locations to retrieve information for. Specify loca-
          tions in the form of an AWS Region code, such as us-west-2 .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return.  Use  this  parameter  with
          NextToken to get results as a set of sequential pages. This limit is
          not currently enforced.

       --next-token (string)
          A token that indicates the start of  the  next  sequential  page  of
          results. Use the token that is returned with a previous call to this
          operation. To start at the beginning of the result set, do not spec-
          ify a value.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FleetId -> (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for  the  fleet that location attributes were
          requested for.

       FleetArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a GameLift fleet
          resource  and  uniquely  identifies  it.  ARNs are unique across all
          Regions.                          Format                          is
          arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912
          .

       LocationAttributes -> (list)
          Location-specific information on the requested fleet's remote  loca-
          tions.

          (structure)
              Represents a location in a multi-location fleet.

              LocationState -> (structure)
                 A fleet location and its current life-cycle state.

                 Location -> (string)
                     The  fleet location, expressed as an AWS Region code such
                     as us-west-2 .

                 Status -> (string)
                     The life-cycle status of a fleet location.

              StoppedActions -> (list)
                 A list of fleet actions that have been suspended in the fleet
                 location.

                 (string)

              UpdateStatus -> (string)
                 The  status  of  fleet  activity updates to the location. The
                 status PENDING_UPDATE  indicates  that   StopFleetActions  or
                 StartFleetActions  has  been requested but the update has not
                 yet been completed for the location.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates where to resume  retrieving  results  on  the
          next  call to this operation. If no token is returned, these results
          represent the end of the list.
