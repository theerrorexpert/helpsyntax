CREATE-VPC-PEERING-CONNECTION()                CREATE-VPC-PEERING-CONNECTION()



NAME
       create-vpc-peering-connection -

DESCRIPTION
       Establishes  a  VPC  peering connection between a virtual private cloud
       (VPC) in an AWS account with the VPC for your  Amazon  GameLift  fleet.
       VPC  peering  enables  the  game  servers  on your fleet to communicate
       directly with other AWS resources. You can peer with VPCs  in  any  AWS
       account  that you have access to, including the account that you use to
       manage your Amazon GameLift fleets. You cannot peer with VPCs that  are
       in different Regions. For more information, see VPC Peering with Amazon
       GameLift Fleets .

       Before calling this operation to establish the peering connection,  you
       first  need to call  CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization and identify the VPC
       you want to peer with. Once the authorization for the specified VPC  is
       issued, you have 24 hours to establish the connection. These two opera-
       tions handle all tasks necessary to peer the two VPCs, including accep-
       tance, updating routing tables, etc.

       To  establish  the connection, call this operation from the AWS account
       that is used to manage the Amazon GameLift fleets. Identify the follow-
       ing values: (1) The ID of the fleet you want to be enable a VPC peering
       connection for; (2) The AWS account with the VPC that you want to  peer
       with;  and  (3) The ID of the VPC you want to peer with. This operation
       is asynchronous. If successful, a  VpcPeeringConnection request is cre-
       ated.  You  can  use  continuous  polling to track the request's status
       using  DescribeVpcPeeringConnections , or by  monitoring  fleet  events
       for success or failure using  DescribeFleetEvents .

SYNOPSIS
            create-vpc-peering-connection
          --fleet-id <value>
          --peer-vpc-aws-account-id <value>
          --peer-vpc-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet. You can use either the  fleet  ID
          or  ARN value. This tells Amazon GameLift which GameLift VPC to peer
          with.

       --peer-vpc-aws-account-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the AWS account with the VPC that  you  want
          to  peer  your Amazon GameLift fleet with. You can find your Account
          ID in the AWS Management Console under account settings.

       --peer-vpc-id (string)
          A unique identifier for a VPC with resources to be accessed by  your
          GameLift fleet. The VPC must be in the same Region as your fleet. To
          look up a VPC ID, use the VPC Dashboard in the AWS  Management  Con-
          sole.  Learn  more  about  VPC  peering in VPC Peering with GameLift
          Fleets .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
