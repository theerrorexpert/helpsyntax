DESCRIBE-FLEET-EVENTS()                                DESCRIBE-FLEET-EVENTS()



NAME
       describe-fleet-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  entries from a fleet's event log. Fleet events are initiated
       by changes in status, such as during fleet  creation  and  termination,
       changes in capacity, etc. If a fleet has multiple locations, events are
       also initiated by changes to status and capacity in remote locations.

       You can specify a time range to limit the result set. Use  the  pagina-
       tion parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.

       If  successful,  a collection of event log entries matching the request
       are returned.

       describe-fleet-events is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Events

SYNOPSIS
            describe-fleet-events
          --fleet-id <value>
          [--start-time <value>]
          [--end-time <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet to get event logs for. You can use
          either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The earliest date to retrieve event logs for. If no  start  time  is
          specified,  this  call  returns entries starting from when the fleet
          was created to the specified end time. Format is a number  expressed
          in Unix time as milliseconds (ex: "1469498468.057").

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The  most  recent date to retrieve event logs for. If no end time is
          specified, this call returns entries from the specified  start  time
          up to the present. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as mil-
          liseconds (ex: "1469498468.057").

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Events -> (list)
          A  collection of objects containing event log entries for the speci-
          fied fleet.

          (structure)
              Log entry describing an event that involves  GameLift  resources
              (such as a fleet). In addition to tracking activity, event codes
              and  messages  can  provide  additional  information  for  trou-
              bleshooting and debugging problems.

                     DescribeFleetEvents

              EventId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for a fleet event.

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier  for an event resource, such as a fleet
                 ID.

              EventCode -> (string)
                 The type of event being logged.
                     Fleet creation events (ordered by fleet  creation  activ-
                     ity):

                 o FLEET_CREATED  -- A fleet resource was successfully created
                   with a status of NEW . Event messaging includes  the  fleet
                   ID.

                 o FLEET_STATE_DOWNLOADING -- Fleet status changed from NEW to
                   DOWNLOADING . The compressed build has started  downloading
                   to a fleet instance for installation.

                 o FLEET_BINARY_DOWNLOAD_FAILED  --  The build failed to down-
                   load to the fleet instance.

                 o FLEET_CREATION_EXTRACTING_BUILD  The game server build  was
                   successfully downloaded to an instance, and the build files
                   are now being extracted from the uploaded build  and  saved
                   to an instance. Failure at this stage prevents a fleet from
                   moving to ACTIVE status. Logs for this stage display a list
                   of  the files that are extracted and saved on the instance.
                   Access the logs by using the URL in PreSignedLogUrl .

                 o FLEET_CREATION_RUNNING_INSTALLER   The  game  server  build
                   files  were successfully extracted, and the GameLift is now
                   running the build's install script (if  one  is  included).
                   Failure  in  this  stage  prevents  a  fleet from moving to
                   ACTIVE status. Logs for this stage  list  the  installation
                   steps  and  whether  or  not the install completed success-
                   fully. Access the logs by using the URL in  PreSignedLogUrl
                   .

                 o FLEET_CREATION_VALIDATING_RUNTIME_CONFIG   --   The   build
                   process was successful, and the GameLift is  now  verifying
                   that  the  game server launch paths, which are specified in
                   the fleet's runtime configuration,  exist.  If  any  listed
                   launch  path exists, GameLift tries to launch a game server
                   process and waits for the process to report ready. Failures
                   in this stage prevent a fleet from moving to ACTIVE status.
                   Logs for this stage list the launch paths  in  the  runtime
                   configuration  and  indicate  whether each is found. Access
                   the logs by using the URL in PreSignedLogUrl .

                 o FLEET_STATE_VALIDATING -- Fleet status changed  from  DOWN-
                   LOADING to VALIDATING .

                 o FLEET_VALIDATION_LAUNCH_PATH_NOT_FOUND -- Validation of the
                   runtime configuration failed because the executable  speci-
                   fied in a launch path does not exist on the instance.

                 o FLEET_STATE_BUILDING  -- Fleet status changed from VALIDAT-
                   ING to BUILDING .

                 o FLEET_VALIDATION_EXECUTABLE_RUNTIME_FAILURE  --  Validation
                   of  the runtime configuration failed because the executable
                   specified in a launch path  failed  to  run  on  the  fleet
                   instance.

                 o FLEET_STATE_ACTIVATING  -- Fleet status changed from BUILD-
                   ING to ACTIVATING .

                 o FLEET_ACTIVATION_FAILED - The fleet failed to  successfully
                   complete  one of the steps in the fleet activation process.
                   This event code indicates that the game build was  success-
                   fully downloaded to a fleet instance, built, and validated,
                   but was not able to start a server process. Learn  more  at
                   Debug Fleet Creation Issues

                 o FLEET_STATE_ACTIVE -- The fleet's status changed from ACTI-
                   VATING to ACTIVE . The fleet is now ready to host game ses-
                   sions.
                     VPC peering events:

                 o FLEET_VPC_PEERING_SUCCEEDED -- A VPC peering connection has
                   been established between the VPC for an GameLift fleet  and
                   a VPC in your AWS account.

                 o FLEET_VPC_PEERING_FAILED -- A requested VPC peering connec-
                   tion has failed. Event details and status information  (see
                   DescribeVpcPeeringConnections  ) provide additional detail.
                   A common reason for peering failure is that  the  two  VPCs
                   have  overlapping CIDR blocks of IPv4 addresses. To resolve
                   this, change the  CIDR  block  for  the  VPC  in  your  AWS
                   account.  For more information on VPC peering failures, see
                   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/PeeringGuide/invalid-peering-configurations.html

                 o FLEET_VPC_PEERING_DELETED  --  A VPC peering connection has
                   been successfully deleted.
                     Spot instance events:

                 o INSTANCE_INTERRUPTED -- A spot instance was interrupted  by
                   EC2 with a two-minute notification.
                     Other fleet events:

                 o FLEET_SCALING_EVENT  --  A  change  was made to the fleet's
                   capacity settings (desired instances, minimum/maximum scal-
                   ing limits). Event messaging includes the new capacity set-
                   tings.

                 o FLEET_NEW_GAME_SESSION_PROTECTION_POLICY_UPDATED    --    A
                   change was made to the fleet's game session protection pol-
                   icy setting. Event messaging includes both the old and  new
                   policy setting.

                 o FLEET_DELETED -- A request to delete a fleet was initiated.

                 o GENERIC_EVENT -- An unspecified event has occurred.

              Message -> (string)
                 Additional information related to the event.

              EventTime -> (timestamp)
                 Time stamp indicating when this event occurred. Format  is  a
                 number  expressed  in  Unix time as milliseconds (for example
                 "1469498468.057" ).
