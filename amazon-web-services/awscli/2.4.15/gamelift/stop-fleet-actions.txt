STOP-FLEET-ACTIONS()                                      STOP-FLEET-ACTIONS()



NAME
       stop-fleet-actions -

DESCRIPTION
       Suspends certain types of activity in a fleet location. Currently, this
       operation is used to stop  auto-scaling  activity.  For  multi-location
       fleets, fleet actions are managed separately for each location.

       Stopping fleet actions has several potential purposes. It allows you to
       temporarily stop auto-scaling activity but retain your scaling policies
       for  use  in  the  future.  For  multi-location  fleets, you can set up
       fleet-wide auto-scaling, and then opt out of it for certain  locations.

       This operation can be used in the following ways:

       o To  stop  actions  on instances in the fleet's home Region, provide a
         fleet ID and the type of actions to suspend.

       o To stop actions on instances in one of the fleet's remote  locations,
         provide  a fleet ID, a location name, and the type of actions to sus-
         pend.

       If successful, GameLift no longer initiates scaling  events  except  in
       response  to manual changes using  UpdateFleetCapacity . You can view a
       fleet's   stopped    actions    using     DescribeFleetAttributes    or
       DescribeFleetLocationAttributes  .  Suspended activity can be restarted
       using  StartFleetActions .

SYNOPSIS
            stop-fleet-actions
          --fleet-id <value>
          --actions <value>
          [--location <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for the fleet to stop actions on. You can use
          either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --actions (list)
          List of actions to suspend on the fleet.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            AUTO_SCALING

       --location (string)
          The fleet location to stop fleet actions for. Specify a location  in
          the form of an AWS Region code, such as us-west-2 .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To stop a fleet's automatic scaling activity

       The  following  stop-fleet-actions example stops the use of all scaling
       policies that are defined for the specified fleet. After  the  policies
       are suspended, fleet capacity remains at the same active instance count
       unless you adjust it manually.

          aws gamelift start-fleet-actions \
              --fleet-id fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111 \
              --actions AUTO_SCALING

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       FleetId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet to stop actions on.

       FleetArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a GameLift fleet
          resource  and  uniquely  identifies  it.  ARNs are unique across all
          Regions.                          Format                          is
          arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912
          .
