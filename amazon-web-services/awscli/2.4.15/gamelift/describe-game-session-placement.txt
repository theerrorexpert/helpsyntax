SYNOPSIS
            describe-game-session-placement
          --placement-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --placement-id (string)
          A unique identifier for a game session placement to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GameSessionPlacement -> (structure)
          Object that describes the requested game session placement.

          PlacementId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for a game session placement.

          GameSessionQueueName -> (string)
              A descriptive label that is associated with game session  queue.
              Queue names must be unique within each Region.

          Status -> (string)
              Current status of the game session placement request.

              o PENDING  --  The  placement  request is currently in the queue
                waiting to be processed.

              o FULFILLED -- A  new  game  session  and  player  sessions  (if
                requested) have been successfully created. Values for GameSes-
                sionArn and GameSessionRegion are available.

              o CANCELLED -- The placement request was canceled with a call to
                StopGameSessionPlacement .

              o TIMED_OUT  --  A new game session was not successfully created
                before the time limit expired. You can resubmit the  placement
                request as needed.

              o FAILED  --  GameLift  is  not  able to complete the process of
                placing the game session. Common reasons are the game  session
                terminated  before  the placement process was completed, or an
                unexpected internal error.

          GameProperties -> (list)
              A set of custom properties for  a  game  session,  formatted  as
              key:value  pairs.  These  properties are passed to a game server
              process in the  GameSession object with a request to start a new
              game session (see Start a Game Session ).

              (structure)
                 Set  of key-value pairs that contain information about a game
                 session. When included in a game session request, these prop-
                 erties communicate details to be used when setting up the new
                 game session. For example, a game property  might  specify  a
                 game  mode,  level, or map. Game properties are passed to the
                 game server process when initiating a new game  session.  For
                 more information, see the GameLift Developer Guide .

                 Key -> (string)
                     The game property identifier.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The game property value.

          MaximumPlayerSessionCount -> (integer)
              The  maximum  number of players that can be connected simultane-
              ously to the game session.

          GameSessionName -> (string)
              A descriptive label that is associated with a game session. Ses-
              sion names do not need to be unique.

          GameSessionId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the game session. This value is set once
              the new game session is placed (placement status is FULFILLED ).

          GameSessionArn -> (string)
              Identifier  for  the  game  session  created  by  this placement
              request. This value is set once the new game session  is  placed
              (placement  status  is  FULFILLED  ).  This identifier is unique
              across all Regions. You can use this value  as  a  GameSessionId
              value as needed.

          GameSessionRegion -> (string)
              Name of the Region where the game session created by this place-
              ment request is running. This value is set  once  the  new  game
              session is placed (placement status is FULFILLED ).

          PlayerLatencies -> (list)
              A  set  of values, expressed in milliseconds, that indicates the
              amount of latency that a player experiences  when  connected  to
              AWS Regions.

              (structure)
                 Regional latency information for a player, used when request-
                 ing a new game session with  StartGameSessionPlacement . This
                 value  indicates  the amount of time lag that exists when the
                 player is connected to a fleet in the specified  Region.  The
                 relative  difference  between  a  player's latency values for
                 multiple Regions are used to determine which fleets are  best
                 suited to place a new game session for the player.

                 PlayerId -> (string)
                     A  unique  identifier  for  a  player associated with the
                     latency data.

                 RegionIdentifier -> (string)
                     Name of the Region that is associated  with  the  latency
                     value.

                 LatencyInMilliseconds -> (float)
                     Amount  of  time that represents the time lag experienced
                     by the player when connected to the specified Region.

          StartTime -> (timestamp)
              Time stamp indicating when this request was placed in the queue.
              Format  is  a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for
              example "1469498468.057" ).

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              Time stamp indicating when this request was completed, canceled,
              or timed out.

          IpAddress -> (string)
              The  IP  address  of  the game session. To connect to a GameLift
              game server, an app needs both the IP address and  port  number.
              This value is set once the new game session is placed (placement
              status is FULFILLED ).

          DnsName -> (string)
              The DNS identifier assigned to the instance that is running  the
              game session. Values have the following format:

              o TLS-enabled   fleets:   <unique   identifier>.<region  identi-
                fier>.amazongamelift.com .

              o Non-TLS-enabled fleets:  ec2-<unique  identifier>.compute.ama-
                zonaws.com . (See Amazon EC2 Instance IP Addressing .)

              When  connecting  to  a  game  session  that  is  running  on  a
              TLS-enabled fleet, you  must  use  the  DNS  name,  not  the  IP
              address.

          Port -> (integer)
              The  port  number for the game session. To connect to a GameLift
              game server, an app needs both the IP address and  port  number.
              This value is set once the new game session is placed (placement
              status is FULFILLED ).

          PlacedPlayerSessions -> (list)
              A collection  of  information  on  player  sessions  created  in
              response  to  the  game  session placement request. These player
              sessions are created only once a new game  session  is  success-
              fully  placed (placement status is FULFILLED ). This information
              includes the player ID (as provided in  the  placement  request)
              and  the  corresponding  player session ID. Retrieve full player
              sessions by calling  DescribePlayerSessions with the player ses-
              sion ID.

              (structure)
                 Information  about  a player session that was created as part
                 of a  StartGameSessionPlacement request. This object contains
                 only  the  player  ID and player session ID. To retrieve full
                 details on a  player  session,  call   DescribePlayerSessions
                 with the player session ID.

              the   GameSession object with a request to start a new game ses-
              sion (see Start a Game Session ).

          MatchmakerData -> (string)
              Information on the matchmaking process for this game. Data is in
              JSON  syntax, formatted as a string. It identifies the matchmak-
              ing configuration used to create the match, and contains data on
              all  players  assigned to the match, including player attributes
              and team assignments. For more details on matchmaker  data,  see
