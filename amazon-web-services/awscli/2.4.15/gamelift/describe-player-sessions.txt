DESCRIBE-PLAYER-SESSIONS()                          DESCRIBE-PLAYER-SESSIONS()



NAME
       describe-player-sessions -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves properties for one or more player sessions.

       This action can be used in the following ways:

       o To  retrieve a specific player session, provide the player session ID
         only.

       o To retrieve all player sessions in a game session, provide  the  game
         session ID only.

       o To  retrieve  all  player  sessions  for a specific player, provide a
         player ID only.

       To request player sessions, specify either a player  session  ID,  game
       session ID, or player ID. You can filter this request by player session
       status. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a  set  of
       sequential pages.

       If successful, a PlayerSession object is returned for each session that
       matches the request.
          Available in Amazon GameLift Local.

       describe-player-sessions is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: PlayerSessions

SYNOPSIS
            describe-player-sessions
          [--game-session-id <value>]
          [--player-id <value>]
          [--player-session-id <value>]
          [--player-session-status-filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --game-session-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the game session to retrieve player sessions
          for.

       --player-id (string)
          A unique identifier for a player to retrieve player sessions for.

       --player-session-id (string)
          A unique identifier for a player session to retrieve.

       --player-session-status-filter (string)
          Player session status to filter results on.

          Possible player session statuses include the following:

          o RESERVED -- The player session request has been received, but  the
            player  has  not  yet  connected to the server process and/or been
            validated.

          o ACTIVE -- The player has been validated by the server process  and
            is currently connected.

          o COMPLETED -- The player connection has been dropped.

          o TIMEDOUT  -- A player session request was received, but the player
            did not connect and/or was not validated within the timeout  limit
            (60 seconds).

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PlayerSessions -> (list)
          A collection of objects containing properties for each  player  ses-
          sion that matches the request.

          (structure)
              Represents  a player session. Player sessions are created either
              for a specific game session, or as part of a game session place-
              ment  or  matchmaking request. A player session can represents a
              reserved player slot in a game session (when status is  RESERVED
              )  or  actual  player activity in a game session (when status is
              ACTIVE ). A player session object,  including  player  data,  is
              automatically  passed to a game session when the player connects
              to the game session and is validated.  After  the  game  session
              ends,  player  sessions  information is retained for 30 days and
              then removed.

              GameSessionId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the game session that the player ses-
                 sion is connected to.

              FleetId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the fleet that the player's game ses-
                 sion is running on.

              FleetArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) associated with the GameLift
                 fleet that the player's game session is running on.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A time stamp indicating when this data  object  was  created.
                 Format  is  a  number  expressed in Unix time as milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              TerminationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A time stamp indicating when this data object was terminated.
                 Format  is  a  number  expressed in Unix time as milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              Status -> (string)
                 Current status of the player session.

                 Possible player session statuses include the following:

                 o RESERVED -- The player session request has  been  received,
                   but  the player has not yet connected to the server process
                   and/or been validated.

                 o ACTIVE -- The player  has  been  validated  by  the  server
                   process and is currently connected.

                 o COMPLETED -- The player connection has been dropped.

                 o TIMEDOUT  -- A player session request was received, but the
                   player did not connect and/or was not validated within  the
                   timeout limit (60 seconds).

              IpAddress -> (string)
                 The  IP address of the game session. To connect to a GameLift
                 game server, an app needs both the IP address and  port  num-
                 ber.

              DnsName -> (string)
                 The  DNS  identifier assigned to the instance that is running
                 the game session. Values have the following format:

                 o TLS-enabled  fleets:  <unique  identifier>.<region  identi-
                   fier>.amazongamelift.com .

                 o Non-TLS-enabled    fleets:   ec2-<unique   identifier>.com-
                   pute.amazonaws.com . (See Amazon EC2 Instance IP Addressing
                   .)

                 When  connecting  to  a  game  session  that  is running on a
                 TLS-enabled fleet, you must use the  DNS  name,  not  the  IP
                 address.

              Port -> (integer)
                 Port  number  for  the  game  session. To connect to a Amazon
                 GameLift server process, an app needs both the IP address and
                 port number.

              PlayerData -> (string)
                 Developer-defined  information  related to a player. GameLift
                 does not use this data, so it can be formatted as needed  for
                 use in the game.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates  where to resume retrieving results on the
          next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these  results
          represent the end of the list.
