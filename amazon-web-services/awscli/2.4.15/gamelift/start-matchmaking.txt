START-MATCHMAKING()                                        START-MATCHMAKING()



NAME
       start-matchmaking -

DESCRIPTION
       Uses  FlexMatch  to create a game match for a group of players based on
       custom matchmaking rules. With games that use GameLift managed hosting,
       this  operation  also  triggers  GameLift to find hosting resources and
       start a new game session for the new match.  Each  matchmaking  request
       includes information on one or more players and specifies the FlexMatch
       matchmaker to use. When a request is for  multiple  players,  FlexMatch
       attempts  to  build  a  match that includes all players in the request,
       placing them in the same team and finding additional players as  needed
       to fill the match.

       To start matchmaking, provide a unique ticket ID, specify a matchmaking
       configuration, and include the players to be  matched.  You  must  also
       include any player attributes that are required by the matchmaking con-
       figuration's rule set. If successful, a matchmaking ticket is  returned
       with status set to QUEUED .

       Track  matchmaking events to respond as needed and acquire game session
       connection information for successfully completed matches. Ticket  sta-
       tus  updates are tracked using event notification through Amazon Simple
       Notification Service (SNS), which is defined in the matchmaking config-
       uration.

SYNOPSIS
            start-matchmaking
          [--ticket-id <value>]
          --configuration-name <value>
          --players <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --ticket-id (string)
          A unique identifier for a matchmaking ticket. If  no  ticket  ID  is
          specified  here,  Amazon GameLift will generate one in the form of a
          UUID. Use this identifier to track the matchmaking ticket status and
          retrieve match results.

       --configuration-name (string)
          Name  of  the  matchmaking  configuration  to  use for this request.
          Matchmaking configurations must exist in the  same  Region  as  this
          request. You can use either the configuration name or ARN value.

       --players (list)
          Information  on  each  player  to  be matched. This information must
          include a player ID, and may contain player attributes  and  latency
          data  to  be  used  in  the  matchmaking process. After a successful
          match, Player objects contain the name of the  team  the  player  is
          assigned to.

          (structure)
              Represents  a player in matchmaking. When starting a matchmaking
              request, a player has a player  ID,  attributes,  and  may  have
              latency  data.  Team information is added after a match has been
              successfully completed.

              PlayerId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for a player

              PlayerAttributes -> (map)
                 A collection of key:value pairs containing player information
                 for  use in matchmaking. Player attribute keys must match the
                 playerAttributes used in a  matchmaking  rule  set.  Example:
                 "PlayerAttributes":  {"skill": {"N": "23"}, "gameMode": {"S":
                 "deathmatch"}} .

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     Values for use in  Player attribute key-value pairs. This
                     object  lets  you specify an attribute value using any of
                     the valid data types: string, number,  string  array,  or
                     data  map. Each AttributeValue object can use only one of
                     the available properties.

                     S -> (string)
                        For single string values. Maximum string length is 100
                        characters.

                     N -> (double)
                        For number values, expressed as double.

                     SL -> (list)
                        For  a  list  of  up to 10 strings. Maximum length for
                        each string is 100 characters.  Duplicate  values  are
                        not  recognized; all occurrences of the repeated value
                        after the first of a repeated value are ignored.

                        (string)

                     SDM -> (map)
                        For a map of up to 10 data type:value  pairs.  Maximum
                        length for each string value is 100 characters.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (double)

              Team -> (string)
                 Name  of  the team that the player is assigned to in a match.
                 Team names are defined in a matchmaking rule set.

              LatencyInMs -> (map)
                 A set of values, expressed in  milliseconds,  that  indicates
                 the  amount  of  latency  that a player experiences when con-
                 nected to AWS Regions. If this property is present, FlexMatch
                 considers placing the match only in Regions for which latency
                 is reported.

                 If a matchmaker has a rule  that  evaluates  player  latency,
                 players  must  report  latency  in order to be matched. If no
                 latency is reported in this scenario, FlexMatch assumes  that
                 no  Regions are available to the player and the ticket is not
                 matchable.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (integer)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          PlayerId=string,PlayerAttributes={KeyName1={S=string,N=double,SL=[string,string],SDM={KeyName1=double,KeyName2=double}},KeyName2={S=string,N=double,SL=[string,string],SDM={KeyName1=double,KeyName2=double}}},Team=string,LatencyInMs={KeyName1=integer,KeyName2=integer} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "PlayerId": "string",
              "PlayerAttributes": {"string": {
                    "S": "string",
                    "N": double,
                    "SL": ["string", ...],
                    "SDM": {"string": double
                      ...}
                  }
                ...},
              "Team": "string",
              "LatencyInMs": {"string": integer
                ...}
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       MatchmakingTicket -> (structure)
          Ticket representing the matchmaking request. This object include the
          information  included  in  the  request,  ticket  status,  and match
          results as generated during the matchmaking process.

          TicketId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for a matchmaking ticket.

          ConfigurationName -> (string)
              Name of the  MatchmakingConfiguration that  is  used  with  this
              ticket.  Matchmaking  configurations  determine  how players are
              grouped into a match and how a new game session is  created  for
              the match.

          ConfigurationArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN ) associated with the GameLift
              matchmaking  configuration  resource  that  is  used  with  this
              ticket.

          Status -> (string)
              Current status of the matchmaking request.

              o QUEUED  --  The  matchmaking  request has been received and is
                currently waiting to be processed.

              o SEARCHING -- The matchmaking request is currently  being  pro-
                cessed.

              o REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE -- A match has been proposed and the play-
                ers must accept the match (see  AcceptMatch ). This status  is
                used  only  with requests that use a matchmaking configuration
                with a player acceptance requirement.

              o PLACING -- The FlexMatch engine has matched players and is  in
                the process of placing a new game session for the match.

              o COMPLETED  --  Players have been matched and a game session is
                ready to host the players. A ticket in this state contains the
                necessary connection information for players.

              o FAILED -- The matchmaking request was not completed.

              o CANCELLED -- The matchmaking request was canceled. This may be
                the result of a call to  StopMatchmaking or a  proposed  match
                that one or more players failed to accept.

              o TIMED_OUT -- The matchmaking request was not successful within
                the duration specified in the matchmaking configuration.

              NOTE:
                 Matchmaking requests that fail to successfully complete (sta-
                 tuses FAILED, CANCELLED, TIMED_OUT) can be resubmitted as new
                 requests with new ticket IDs.

          StatusReason -> (string)
              Code to explain the current status. For example, a status reason
              may  indicate  when  a  ticket  has returned to SEARCHING status
              after a proposed match fails to receive player acceptances.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              Additional information about the current status.

          StartTime -> (timestamp)
              Time  stamp  indicating  when  this  matchmaking   request   was
              received. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as millisec-
              onds (for example "1469498468.057" ).

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              Time stamp indicating  when  this  matchmaking  request  stopped
              being processed due to success, failure, or cancellation. Format
              is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for  example
              "1469498468.057" ).

          Players -> (list)
              A  set  of  Player  objects,  each representing a player to find
              matches for. Players are identified by a unique  player  ID  and
              may  include  latency  data  for  use during matchmaking. If the
              ticket is in status COMPLETED , the Player objects  include  the
              team the players were assigned to in the resulting match.

              (structure)
                 Represents a player in matchmaking. When starting a matchmak-
                 ing request, a player has a player ID,  attributes,  and  may
                 have  latency  data.  Team information is added after a match
                 has been successfully completed.

                 PlayerId -> (string)
                     A unique identifier for a player

                 PlayerAttributes -> (map)
                     A collection of key:value pairs containing player  infor-
                     mation for use in matchmaking. Player attribute keys must
                     match the playerAttributes used  in  a  matchmaking  rule
                     set.  Example: "PlayerAttributes": {"skill": {"N": "23"},
                     "gameMode": {"S": "deathmatch"}} .

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        Values for use in  Player attribute  key-value  pairs.
                        This  object lets you specify an attribute value using
                        any of the valid data types:  string,  number,  string
                        array, or data map. Each AttributeValue object can use
                        only one of the available properties.

                        S -> (string)
                            For single string values. Maximum string length is
                            100 characters.

                        N -> (double)
                            For number values, expressed as double.

                        SL -> (list)
                            For a list of up to 10 strings. Maximum length for
                            each string is 100  characters.  Duplicate  values
                            are   not   recognized;  all  occurrences  of  the
                            repeated value after the first of a repeated value
                            are ignored.

                            (string)

                        SDM -> (map)
                            For a map of up to 10 data type:value pairs. Maxi-
                            mum length for each string value  is  100  charac-
                            ters.

                            key -> (string)

                            value -> (double)

                 Team -> (string)
                     Name  of  the  team  that  the player is assigned to in a
                     match. Team names are defined in a matchmaking rule  set.

                 LatencyInMs -> (map)
                     A  set  of  values, expressed in milliseconds, that indi-
                     cates the amount of latency  that  a  player  experiences
                     when  connected  to  AWS  Regions.  If  this  property is
                     present, FlexMatch considers placing the  match  only  in
                     Regions for which latency is reported.

                     If a matchmaker has a rule that evaluates player latency,
                     players must report latency in order to be matched. If no
                     latency  is  reported in this scenario, FlexMatch assumes
                     that no Regions are  available  to  the  player  and  the
                     ticket is not matchable.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (integer)

          GameSessionConnectionInfo -> (structure)
              Identifier  and  connection information of the game session cre-
              ated for the match. This information is added to the ticket only
              after  the  matchmaking request has been successfully completed.
              This parameter is not set when FlexMatch is being  used  without
              GameLift hosting.

              GameSessionArn -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier for the game session. Use the game ses-
                 sion ID.

              IpAddress -> (string)
                 The IP address of the game session. To connect to a  GameLift
                 game  server,  an app needs both the IP address and port num-
                 ber.

              DnsName -> (string)
                 The DNS identifier assigned to the instance that  is  running
                 the game session. Values have the following format:

                 o TLS-enabled  fleets:  <unique  identifier>.<region  identi-
                   fier>.amazongamelift.com .

                 o Non-TLS-enabled   fleets:   ec2-<unique    identifier>.com-
                   pute.amazonaws.com . (See Amazon EC2 Instance IP Addressing
                   .)

                 When connecting to a  game  session  that  is  running  on  a
                 TLS-enabled  fleet,  you  must  use  the DNS name, not the IP
                 address.

              Port -> (integer)
                 The port number  for  the  game  session.  To  connect  to  a
                 GameLift  game  server,  an app needs both the IP address and
                 port number.

              MatchedPlayerSessions -> (list)
                 A collection of player session IDs, one for  each  player  ID
                 that was included in the original matchmaking request.

                 (structure)
                     Represents  a  new  player  session  that is created as a
                     result of a  successful  FlexMatch  match.  A  successful
                     match automatically creates new player sessions for every
                     player ID in the original matchmaking request.

                     When players connect to the match's  game  session,  they
                     must  include  both  player  ID  and player session ID in
                     order to claim their assigned player slot.

                     PlayerId -> (string)
                        A unique identifier for a player

                     PlayerSessionId -> (string)
                        A unique identifier for a player session

          EstimatedWaitTime -> (integer)
              Average amount of time (in seconds) that players  are  currently
