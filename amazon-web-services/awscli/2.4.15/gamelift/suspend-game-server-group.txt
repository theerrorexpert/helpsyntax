SUSPEND-GAME-SERVER-GROUP()                        SUSPEND-GAME-SERVER-GROUP()



NAME
       suspend-game-server-group -

DESCRIPTION
          This  operation  is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game
          server groups.

       Temporarily stops activity on a game server group  without  terminating
       instances or the game server group. You can restart activity by calling
       ResumeGameServerGroup . You can suspend the following activity:

       o Instance type replacement - This activity evaluates the current  game
         hosting viability of all Spot instance types that are defined for the
         game server group. It updates the Auto Scaling group to remove nonvi-
         able  Spot  Instance types, which have a higher chance of game server
         interruptions. It then balances capacity across the remaining  viable
         Spot  Instance types. When this activity is suspended, the Auto Scal-
         ing group continues with its current balance, regardless  of  viabil-
         ity.  Instance  protection, utilization metrics, and capacity scaling
         activities continue to be active.

       To suspend activity, specify a game server group ARN and  the  type  of
       activity  to  be suspended. If successful, a  GameServerGroup object is
       returned showing that the activity is listed in SuspendedActions .

SYNOPSIS
            suspend-game-server-group
          --game-server-group-name <value>
          --suspend-actions <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --game-server-group-name (string)
          A unique identifier for the game server group. Use either the  Game-
          ServerGroup name or ARN value.

       --suspend-actions (list)
          The activity to suspend for this game server group.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            REPLACE_INSTANCE_TYPES

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GameServerGroup -> (structure)
          An object that describes the game server group  resource,  with  the
          SuspendedActions property updated to reflect the suspended activity.

          GameServerGroupName -> (string)
              A developer-defined identifier for the game  server  group.  The
              name is unique for each Region in each AWS account.

          GameServerGroupArn -> (string)
              A generated unique ID for the game server group.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) for an IAM role that allows Ama-
              zon GameLift to access your EC2 Auto Scaling groups.

          InstanceDefinitions -> (list)
              The set of EC2 instance types that GameLift FleetIQ can use when
              balancing and automatically scaling instances in the correspond-
              ing Auto Scaling group.

              (structure)
                     This data type is used with the GameLift FleetIQ and game
                     server groups.

                 An  allowed  instance  type for a  GameServerGroup . All game
                 server groups must have at least two instance  types  defined
                 for  it. GameLift FleetIQ periodically evaluates each defined
                 instance type for viability. It then updates the Auto Scaling
                 group with the list of viable instance types.

                 InstanceType -> (string)
                     An EC2 instance type designation.

                 WeightedCapacity -> (string)
                     Instance  weighting that indicates how much this instance
                     type contributes to the total capacity of a  game  server
                     group.  Instance  weights are used by GameLift FleetIQ to
                     calculate the instance type's cost per unit hour and bet-
                     ter   identify   the  most  cost-effective  options.  For
                     detailed information on weighting instance capacity,  see
                     Instance  Weighting  in  the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User
                     Guide . Default value is "1".

          BalancingStrategy -> (string)
              Indicates  how  GameLift  FleetIQ  balances  the  use  of   Spot
              Instances  and  On-Demand  Instances  in  the game server group.
              Method options include the following:

              o SPOT_ONLY - Only Spot Instances are used in  the  game  server
                group.  If  Spot  Instances  are unavailable or not viable for
                game hosting, the game server group provides no hosting capac-
                ity until Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new
                instances  are  started,  and  the  existing  nonviable   Spot
                Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are
                not replaced.

              o SPOT_PREFERRED - (default value) Spot Instances are used when-
                ever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are
                unavailable, the game server group continues to provide  host-
                ing  capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing
                nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after  current  game-
                play ends) and are replaced with new On-Demand Instances.

              o ON_DEMAND_ONLY - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game
                server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available,
                while this balancing strategy is in force.

          GameServerProtectionPolicy -> (string)
              A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group
              are protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that
              have  active  game  servers running might be terminated during a
              scale-down event, causing players to be dropped from  the  game.
              Protected  instances cannot be terminated while there are active
              game servers running except in the event of a forced game server
              group  deletion  (see  ).  An  exception  to  this  is with Spot
              Instances, which can be terminated by AWS regardless of  protec-
              tion status.

          AutoScalingGroupArn -> (string)
              A  generated  unique  ID  for the EC2 Auto Scaling group that is
              associated with this game server group.

          Status -> (string)
              The current status of the game server group.  Possible  statuses
              include:

              o NEW  -  GameLift  FleetIQ  has validated the CreateGameServer-
                Group() request.

              o ACTIVATING - GameLift FleetIQ is  setting  up  a  game  server
                group,  which  includes creating an Auto Scaling group in your
                AWS account.

              o ACTIVE - The game server group has been successfully  created.

              o DELETE_SCHEDULED  -  A request to delete the game server group
                has been received.

              o DELETING - GameLift FleetIQ has received a  valid  DeleteGame-
                ServerGroup()  request  and is processing it. GameLift FleetIQ
                must first complete and release hosts before  it  deletes  the
                Auto Scaling group and the game server group.

              o DELETED - The game server group has been successfully deleted.

              o ERROR - The asynchronous processes of activating or deleting a
                game server group has failed, resulting in an error state.

          StatusReason -> (string)
              Additional  information about the current game server group sta-
              tus. This information might provide additional insight on groups
              that are in ERROR status.

          SuspendedActions -> (list)
              A  list of activities that are currently suspended for this game
              server group. If this property  is  empty,  all  activities  are
              occurring.

              (string)

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A  time stamp indicating when this data object was created. For-
              mat is a number expressed in  Unix  time  as  milliseconds  (for
              example "1469498468.057" ).

          LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
              A  timestamp that indicates when this game server group was last
              updated.
