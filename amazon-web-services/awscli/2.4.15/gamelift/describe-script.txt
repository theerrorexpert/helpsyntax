SYNOPSIS
            describe-script
          --script-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --script-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier for the Realtime script to retrieve properties
          for. You can use either the script ID or ARN value.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Script -> (structure)
          A set of properties describing the requested script.

          ScriptId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the Realtime script

          ScriptArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to  a  GameLift
              script  resource  and  uniquely  identifies  it. ARNs are unique
              across all Regions. In a GameLift script ARN,  the  resource  ID
              matches the ScriptId value.

          Name -> (string)
              A  descriptive  label  that  is associated with a script. Script
              names do not need to be unique.

          Version -> (string)
              Version information that is associated with a build  or  script.
              Version strings do not need to be unique.

          SizeOnDisk -> (long)
              The  file  size  of  the  uploaded Realtime script, expressed in
              bytes. When files are uploaded from an S3 location,  this  value
              remains at "0".

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A  time stamp indicating when this data object was created. For-
              mat is a number expressed in  Unix  time  as  milliseconds  (for
              example "1469498468.057" ).

          StorageLocation -> (structure)
              The location in Amazon S3 where build or script files are stored
              for access by Amazon GameLift. This  location  is  specified  in
              CreateBuild ,  CreateScript , and  UpdateScript requests.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 An  Amazon  S3  bucket identifier. This is the name of the S3
                 bucket.

                 NOTE:
                     GameLift currently does not support uploading from Amazon
                     S3 buckets with names that contain a dot (.).

              Key -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  zip file that contains the build files or
                 script files.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) for an IAM role  that  allows
                 Amazon GameLift to access the S3 bucket.

              ObjectVersion -> (string)
                 The  version  of  the file, if object versioning is turned on
                 for the bucket. Amazon GameLift uses  this  information  when
                 retrieving  files  from  an  S3 bucket that you own. Use this
                 parameter to specify a specific version of the file.  If  not
                 set, the latest version of the file is retrieved.
