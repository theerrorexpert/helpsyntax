NAME
       describe-matchmaking-rule-sets -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  details  for  FlexMatch  matchmaking rule sets. You can
       request all existing rule sets for the Region, or provide a list of one
       or more rule set names. When requesting multiple items, use the pagina-
       tion parameters to retrieve results as a set of  sequential  pages.  If
       successful, a rule set is returned for each requested name.

       describe-matchmaking-rule-sets  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: RuleSets

SYNOPSIS
            describe-matchmaking-rule-sets
          [--names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --names (list)
          A list of one or more matchmaking rule set names to retrieve details
          for.  (Note: The rule set name is different from the optional "name"
          field in the rule set body.) You can use either the rule set name or
          ARN value.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RuleSets -> (list)
          A collection of requested matchmaking rule set objects.

          (structure)
              Set of rule statements, used with FlexMatch, that determine  how
              to  build your player matches. Each rule set describes a type of
              group to be created and defines the  parameters  for  acceptable
              player  matches. Rule sets are used in  MatchmakingConfiguration
              objects.

              A rule set may define the following elements for  a  match.  For
              detailed  information  and  examples  showing how to construct a
              rule set, see Build a FlexMatch rule set .

              o Teams -- Required. A rule set  must  define  one  or  multiple
                teams  for  the  match and set minimum and maximum team sizes.
                For example, a rule  set  might  describe  a  4x4  match  that
                requires all eight slots to be filled.

              o Player  attributes -- Optional. These attributes specify a set
                of player characteristics  to  evaluate  when  looking  for  a
                match.  Matchmaking  requests  that use a rule set with player
                attributes must provide the  corresponding  attribute  values.
                For  example,  an  attribute might specify a player's skill or
                level.

              o Rules -- Optional. Rules  define  how  to  evaluate  potential
                players  for  a match based on player attributes. A rule might
                specify minimum requirements for individual players, teams, or
                entire  matches. For example, a rule might require each player
                to meet a certain skill level, each team to have at least  one
                player in a certain role, or the match to have a minimum aver-
                age skill level. or may describe an entire group--such as  all
                teams  must be evenly matched or have at least one player in a
                certain role.

              o Expansions -- Optional. Expansions  allow  you  to  relax  the
                rules  after  a  period of time when no acceptable matches are
                found. This feature lets  you  balance  getting  players  into
                games  in  a  reasonable amount of time instead of making them
                wait indefinitely for the best possible  match.  For  example,
                you might use an expansion to increase the maximum skill vari-
                ance between players after 30 seconds.

              RuleSetName -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the matchmaking rule set

              RuleSetArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN  )  that  is  assigned  to  a
                 GameLift  matchmaking  rule set resource and uniquely identi-
                 fies it. ARNs  are  unique  across  all  Regions.  Format  is
                 arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::matchmakingruleset/<ruleset  name>
                 . In a GameLift rule set ARN, the  resource  ID  matches  the
                 RuleSetName value.

              RuleSetBody -> (string)
                 A  collection  of  matchmaking  rules,  formatted  as  a JSON
                 string. Comments are not allowed in JSON, but  most  elements
                 support a description field.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  time  stamp  indicating when this data object was created.
                 Format is a number expressed in  Unix  time  as  milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates  where to resume retrieving results on the
          next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these  results
          represent the end of the list.
