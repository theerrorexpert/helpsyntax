NAME
       describe-game-server-instances -

DESCRIPTION
          This  operation  is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game
          server groups.

       Retrieves status information about the Amazon EC2 instances  associated
       with a GameLift FleetIQ game server group. Use this operation to detect
       when instances are active or not available to host new game servers. If
       you   are   looking   for   instance  configuration  information,  call
       DescribeGameServerGroup or access the corresponding Auto Scaling  group
       properties.

       To request status for all instances in the game server group, provide a
       game server group ID only. To request status  for  specific  instances,
       provide  the game server group ID and one or more instance IDs. Use the
       pagination parameters to retrieve results in  sequential  segments.  If
       successful, a collection of GameServerInstance objects is returned.

       This  operation  is  not  designed  to be called with every game server
       claim request; this practice can cause you to exceed  your  API  limit,
       which results in errors. Instead, as a best practice, cache the results
       and refresh your cache no more than once every 10 seconds.

       describe-game-server-instances  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: GameServerInstances

SYNOPSIS
            describe-game-server-instances
          --game-server-group-name <value>
          [--instance-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --game-server-group-name (string)
          A unique identifier for the game server group. Use either the  Game-
          ServerGroup name or ARN value.

       --instance-ids (list)
          The  EC2  instance  IDs  that  you  want  to retrieve status on. EC2
          instance   IDs   use   a   17-character   format,    for    example:
          i-1234567890abcdef0  .  To retrieve all instances in the game server
          group, leave this parameter empty.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GameServerInstances -> (list)
          The collection of requested game server instances.

          (structure)
                 This  data  type  is  used with the GameLift FleetIQ and game
                 server groups.

              Additional properties, including status, that  describe  an  EC2
              instance in a game server group. Instance configurations are set
              with game server group properties  (see  DescribeGameServerGroup
              and with the EC2 launch template that was used when creating the
              game server group.

              Retrieve game server instances for a game server group by  call-
              ing DescribeGameServerInstances .

              GameServerGroupName -> (string)
                 A developer-defined identifier for the game server group that
                 includes the game server instance. The  name  is  unique  for
                 each Region in each AWS account.

              GameServerGroupArn -> (string)
                 A  generated unique identifier for the game server group that
                 includes the game server instance.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the instance where the game  server
                 is  running.  This  ID is available in the instance metadata.
                 EC2 instance IDs use  a  17-character  format,  for  example:
                 i-1234567890abcdef0 .

              InstanceStatus -> (string)
                 Current status of the game server instance.

                 o ACTIVE  -- The instance is viable for hosting game servers.

                 o DRAINING -- The instance is not  viable  for  hosting  game
                   servers.  Existing  game servers are in the process of end-
                   ing, and new game servers are not started on this  instance
                   unless  no other resources are available. When the instance
                   is put in DRAINING, a new instance is started up to replace
                   it. Once the instance has no UTILIZED game servers, it will
                   be terminated in favor of the new instance.

                 o SPOT_TERMINATING -- The instance is in the process of shut-
                   ting  down due to a Spot instance interruption. No new game
                   servers are started on this instance.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates where to resume  retrieving  results  on  the
          next  call to this operation. If no token is returned, these results
          represent the end of the list.
