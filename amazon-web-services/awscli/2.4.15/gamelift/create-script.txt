CREATE-SCRIPT()                                                CREATE-SCRIPT()



NAME
       create-script -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a new script record for your Realtime Servers script. Realtime
       scripts are JavaScript that provide configuration settings and optional
       custom game logic for your game. The script is deployed when you create
       a Realtime Servers fleet to host your game sessions.  Script  logic  is
       executed during an active game session.

       To  create  a  new script record, specify a script name and provide the
       script file(s). The script files and all dependencies  must  be  zipped
       into  a  single  file.  You  can pull the zip file from either of these
       locations:

       o A locally available directory. Use the  ZipFile  parameter  for  this
         option.

       o An  Amazon  Simple  Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket under your AWS
         account. Use the StorageLocation parameter for  this  option.  You'll
         need to have an Identity Access Management (IAM) role that allows the
         Amazon GameLift service to access your S3 bucket.

       If the call is successful, a new script record is created with a unique
       script  ID. If the script file is provided as a local file, the file is
       uploaded to an Amazon GameLift-owned S3 bucket and the script  record's
       storage location reflects this location. If the script file is provided
       as an S3 bucket, Amazon GameLift accesses  the  file  at  this  storage
       location as needed for deployment.

SYNOPSIS
            create-script
          [--name <value>]
          [--storage-location <value>]
          [--zip-file <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--script-version <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          A descriptive label that is associated with a script.  Script  names
          do  not  need to be unique. You can use  UpdateScript to change this
          value later.

       --storage-location (structure)
          The location of the Amazon S3 bucket where a zipped file  containing
          your  Realtime  scripts is stored. The storage location must specify
          the Amazon S3 bucket name, the zip file name (the "key"), and a role
          ARN  that  allows  Amazon  GameLift  to access the Amazon S3 storage
          location. The S3 bucket must be in the same Region where you want to
          create  a new script. By default, Amazon GameLift uploads the latest
          version of the zip file; if you have S3 object versioning turned on,
          you  can  use the ObjectVersion parameter to specify an earlier ver-
          sion.

          Bucket -> (string)
              An Amazon S3 bucket identifier. This  is  the  name  of  the  S3
              bucket.

              NOTE:
                 GameLift  currently does not support uploading from Amazon S3
                 buckets with names that contain a dot (.).

          Key -> (string)
              The name of the zip file that contains the build files or script
              files.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) for an IAM role that allows Ama-
              zon GameLift to access the S3 bucket.

          ObjectVersion -> (string)
              The version of the file, if object versioning is turned  on  for
              the  bucket. Amazon GameLift uses this information when retriev-
              ing files from an S3 bucket that you own. Use this parameter  to
              specify  a  specific version of the file. If not set, the latest
              version of the file is retrieved.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Bucket=string,Key=string,RoleArn=string,ObjectVersion=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Bucket": "string",
            "Key": "string",
            "RoleArn": "string",
            "ObjectVersion": "string"
          }

       --zip-file (blob)
          A data object containing your Realtime scripts and dependencies as a
          zip  file. The zip file can have one or multiple files. Maximum size
          of a zip file is 5 MB.

          When using the AWS CLI tool to create a script,  this  parameter  is
          set  to  the  zip  file  name.  It must be prepended with the string
          "fileb://" to indicate that the file data is a  binary  object.  For
          example: --zip-file fileb://myRealtimeScript.zip .

       --tags (list)
          A  list  of  labels  to  assign to the new script resource. Tags are
          developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging AWS resources are  useful
          for  resource management, access management and cost allocation. For
          more information, see Tagging AWS Resources in the AWS General  Ref-
          erence  .  Once  the resource is created, you can use  TagResource ,
          UntagResource , and  ListTagsForResource to add,  remove,  and  view
          tags.  The  maximum  tag limit may be lower than stated. See the AWS
          General Reference for actual tagging limits.

          (structure)
              A label that can be assigned to a GameLift resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for a developer-defined key:value pair for tagging an
                 AWS resource.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for a developer-defined key:value pair for  tagging
                 an AWS resource.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --script-version (string)
          Version  information that is associated with a build or script. Ver-
          sion strings do not need to be unique. You can use  UpdateScript  to
          change this value later.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Script -> (structure)
          The newly created script record with a unique script ID and ARN. The
          new script's storage location reflects an Amazon S3 location: (1) If
          the  script  was  uploaded from an S3 bucket under your account, the
          storage location reflects the information that was provided  in  the
          CreateScript  request;  (2)  If  the script file was uploaded from a
          local zip file, the storage location reflects an  S3  location  con-
          trols by the Amazon GameLift service.

          ScriptId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the Realtime script

          ScriptArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a GameLift
              script resource and uniquely  identifies  it.  ARNs  are  unique
              across  all  Regions.  In a GameLift script ARN, the resource ID
              matches the ScriptId value.

          Name -> (string)
              A descriptive label that is associated  with  a  script.  Script
              names do not need to be unique.

          Version -> (string)
              Version  information  that is associated with a build or script.
              Version strings do not need to be unique.

          SizeOnDisk -> (long)
              The file size of the  uploaded  Realtime  script,  expressed  in
              bytes.  When  files are uploaded from an S3 location, this value
              remains at "0".

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A time stamp indicating when this data object was created.  For-
              mat  is  a  number  expressed  in Unix time as milliseconds (for
              example "1469498468.057" ).

          StorageLocation -> (structure)
              The location in Amazon S3 where build or script files are stored
              for  access  by  Amazon  GameLift. This location is specified in
              CreateBuild ,  CreateScript , and  UpdateScript requests.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 An Amazon S3 bucket identifier. This is the name  of  the  S3
                 bucket.

                 NOTE:
                     GameLift currently does not support uploading from Amazon
                     S3 buckets with names that contain a dot (.).

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the zip file that contains  the  build  files  or
                 script files.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN ) for an IAM role that allows
                 Amazon GameLift to access the S3 bucket.

              ObjectVersion -> (string)
                 The version of the file, if object versioning  is  turned  on
                 for  the  bucket.  Amazon GameLift uses this information when
                 retrieving files from an S3 bucket that  you  own.  Use  this
                 parameter  to  specify a specific version of the file. If not
                 set, the latest version of the file is retrieved.
