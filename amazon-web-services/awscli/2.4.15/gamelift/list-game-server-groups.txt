       list-game-server-groups  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: GameServerGroups

SYNOPSIS
            list-game-server-groups
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GameServerGroups -> (list)
          A collection of game server group objects that match the request.

          (structure)
                 This  data  type  is  used with the GameLift FleetIQ and game
                 server groups.

              Properties that describe a game server group  resource.  A  game
              server group manages certain properties related to a correspond-
              ing EC2 Auto Scaling group.

              A game server group is created by  a  successful  call  to  Cre-
              ateGameServerGroup  and deleted by calling DeleteGameServerGroup
              . Game server group activity can be  temporarily  suspended  and
              resumed  by calling SuspendGameServerGroup and ResumeGameServer-
              Group , respectively.

              GameServerGroupName -> (string)
                 A developer-defined identifier for the game server group. The
                 name is unique for each Region in each AWS account.

              GameServerGroupArn -> (string)
                 A generated unique ID for the game server group.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN ) for an IAM role that allows
                 Amazon GameLift to access your EC2 Auto Scaling groups.

              InstanceDefinitions -> (list)
                 The set of EC2 instance types that GameLift FleetIQ  can  use
                 when  balancing  and  automatically  scaling instances in the
                 corresponding Auto Scaling group.

                 (structure)
                        This data type is used with the GameLift  FleetIQ  and
                        game server groups.

                     An  allowed  instance  type  for a  GameServerGroup . All
                     game server groups must have at least two instance  types
                     defined  for  it. GameLift FleetIQ periodically evaluates
                     each defined instance type for viability. It then updates
                     the  Auto  Scaling group with the list of viable instance
                     types.

                     InstanceType -> (string)
                        An EC2 instance type designation.

                     WeightedCapacity -> (string)
                        Instance  weighting  that  indicates  how  much   this
                        instance  type  contributes to the total capacity of a
                        game  server  group.  Instance  weights  are  used  by
                        GameLift FleetIQ to calculate the instance type's cost
                        per unit hour and better identify the most cost-effec-
                        tive  options.  For  detailed information on weighting
                        instance capacity, see Instance Weighting in the  Ama-
                        zon  EC2  Auto  Scaling  User Guide . Default value is
                        "1".

              BalancingStrategy -> (string)
                 Indicates how GameLift  FleetIQ  balances  the  use  of  Spot
                 Instances  and  On-Demand Instances in the game server group.
                 Method options include the following:

                 o SPOT_ONLY - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server
                   group.  If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for
                   game hosting, the game server  group  provides  no  hosting
                   capacity  until  Spot  Instances  can  again be used. Until
                   then, no new instances are started, and the existing nonvi-
                   able  Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay
                   ends) and are not replaced.

                 o SPOT_PREFERRED - (default value) Spot  Instances  are  used
                   whenever  available  in  the  game  server  group.  If Spot
                   Instances are unavailable, the game server group  continues
                   to  provide  hosting  capacity by falling back to On-Demand
                   Instances. Existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated
                   (after  current  gameplay  ends)  and are replaced with new
                   On-Demand Instances.

                 o ON_DEMAND_ONLY - Only On-Demand Instances are used  in  the
                   game  server  group.  No Spot Instances are used, even when
                   available, while this balancing strategy is in force.

              GameServerProtectionPolicy -> (string)
                 A flag that indicates whether instances in  the  game  server
                 group  are  protected  from  early  termination.  Unprotected
                 instances that have active game servers running might be ter-
                 minated  during  a  scale-down  event,  causing players to be
                 dropped from the game. Protected instances cannot  be  termi-
                 nated  while  there are active game servers running except in
                 the event of a forced game server group deletion (see  ).  An
                 exception to this is with Spot Instances, which can be termi-
                 nated by AWS regardless of protection status.

              AutoScalingGroupArn -> (string)
                 A generated unique ID for the EC2 Auto Scaling group that  is
                 associated with this game server group.

              Status -> (string)
                 The  current  status  of the game server group. Possible sta-
                 tuses include:

                 o NEW - GameLift FleetIQ has validated the  CreateGameServer-
                   Group() request.

                 o ACTIVATING  -  GameLift FleetIQ is setting up a game server
                   group, which includes creating an  Auto  Scaling  group  in
                   your AWS account.

                 o ACTIVE  -  The game server group has been successfully cre-
                   ated.

                 o DELETE_SCHEDULED - A request  to  delete  the  game  server
                   group has been received.

                 o DELETING   -   GameLift   FleetIQ   has  received  a  valid
                   DeleteGameServerGroup()  request  and  is  processing   it.
                   GameLift  FleetIQ  must  first  complete  and release hosts
                   before it deletes the  Auto  Scaling  group  and  the  game
                   server group.

                 o DELETED  -  The  game  server  group  has been successfully
                   deleted.

                 o ERROR - The asynchronous processes of activating or  delet-
                   ing  a  game server group has failed, resulting in an error
                   state.

              StatusReason -> (string)
                 Additional information about the current  game  server  group
                 status.  This information might provide additional insight on
                 groups that are in ERROR status.

              SuspendedActions -> (list)
                 A list of activities that are currently  suspended  for  this
                 game  server group. If this property is empty, all activities
                 are occurring.

                 (string)

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A time stamp indicating when this data  object  was  created.
                 Format  is  a  number  expressed in Unix time as milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp that indicates when this game  server  group  was
                 last updated.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates  where to resume retrieving results on the
          next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these  results
          represent the end of the list.
