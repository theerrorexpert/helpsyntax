LIST-FLEETS()                                                    LIST-FLEETS()



NAME
       list-fleets -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  collection  of  fleet resources in an AWS Region. You can
       call this operation to get fleets  in  a  previously  selected  default
       Region                                                             (see
       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/setting-global-region.html
       or  specify  a Region in your request. You can filter the result set to
       find only those fleets that are  deployed  with  a  specific  build  or
       script.  For  fleets  that  have  multiple  locations,  this  operation
       retrieves fleets based on their home Region only.

       This operation can be used in the following ways:

       o To get a list of all fleets in a Region, don't  provide  a  build  or
         script identifier.

       o To  get  a  list  of all fleets where a specific custom game build is
         deployed, provide the build ID.

       o To get a list of all Realtime Servers fleets with a specific configu-
         ration script, provide the script ID.

       Use  the  pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequen-
       tial pages.

       If successful, a list of fleet IDs that match the request parameters is
       returned.  A  NextToken value is also returned if there are more result
       pages to retrieve.

       NOTE:
              Fleet resources are not listed in a particular order.

       list-fleets  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: FleetIds

SYNOPSIS
            list-fleets
          [--build-id <value>]
          [--script-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --build-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the build to request fleets  for.  Use  this
          parameter  to return only fleets using a specified build. Use either
          the build ID or ARN value.

       --script-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the Realtime script to request  fleets  for.
          Use  this  parameter to return only fleets using a specified script.
          Use either the script ID or ARN value.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example1: To get a list of all fleets in a Region

       The  following list-fleets example displays the fleet IDs of all fleets
       in the current Region.  This  example  uses  pagination  parameters  to
       retrieve  two  fleet  IDs at a time. The response includes a next-token
       attribute, which indicates that there are more results to retrieve.

          aws gamelift list-fleets \
              --limit 2

       Output:

          {
              "FleetIds": [
                  "fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                  "fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222"
              ],
              "NextToken": "eyJhd3NBY2NvdW50SWQiOnsicyI6IjMwMjc3NjAxNjM5OCJ9LCJidWlsZElkIjp7InMiOiJidWlsZC01NWYxZTZmMS1jY2FlLTQ3YTctOWI5ZS1iYjFkYTQwMjJEXAMPLE="
          }

       You can pass the NextToken value from the previous response in the next
       command, as shown here to get the next two results.

          aws gamelift list-fleets \
              --limit 2 \
              --next-token eyJhd3NBY2NvdW50SWQiOnsicyI6IjMwMjc3NjAxNjM5OCJ9LCJidWlsZElkIjp7InMiOiJidWlsZC00NDRlZjQxZS1hM2I1LTQ2NDYtODJmMy0zYzI4ZTgxNjVjEXAMPLE=

       Example2: To get a list of all fleets in a Region with a specific build
       or script

       The following list-builds example retrieves the IDs of fleets that  are
       deployed with the specified game build. If you're working with Realtime
       Servers, you can provide a script ID in place of a  build  ID.  Because
       this  example  does  not  specify  the limit parameter, the results can
       include up to 16 fleet IDs.

          aws gamelift list-fleets \
              --build-id build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111

       Output:

          {
              "FleetIds": [
                  "fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222",
                  "fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE33333",
                  "fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE44444"
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       FleetIds -> (list)
          A set of fleet IDs that match the list  request.  You  can  retrieve
          additional  information  about  all  returned fleets by passing this
          result set to a  DescribeFleetAttributes ,  DescribeFleetCapacity  ,
          or  DescribeFleetUtilization call.

          (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates  where to resume retrieving results on the
          next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these  results
          represent the end of the list.
