SYNOPSIS
            update-fleet-attributes
          --fleet-id <value>
          [--name <value>]
          [--description <value>]
          [--new-game-session-protection-policy <value>]
          [--resource-creation-limit-policy <value>]
          [--metric-groups <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A  unique identifier for the fleet to update attribute metadata for.
          You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --name (string)
          A descriptive label that is associated with a fleet. Fleet names  do
          not need to be unique.

       --description (string)
          A human-readable description of a fleet.

       --new-game-session-protection-policy (string)
          The  game  session  protection  policy to apply to all new instances
          created  in  this  fleet.  Instances  that  already  exist  are  not
          affected.  You  can  set  protection  for individual instances using
          UpdateGameSession .

          o NoProtection -- The  game  session  can  be  terminated  during  a
            scale-down event.

          o FullProtection  --  If the game session is in an ACTIVE status, it
            cannot be terminated during a scale-down event.

          Possible values:

          o NoProtection

          o FullProtection

       --resource-creation-limit-policy (structure)
          Policy settings that limit the number of game sessions an individual
          player can create over a span of time.

          NewGameSessionsPerCreator -> (integer)
              The  maximum number of game sessions that an individual can cre-
              ate during the policy period.

          PolicyPeriodInMinutes -> (integer)
              The time span used in evaluating  the  resource  creation  limit
              policy.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          NewGameSessionsPerCreator=integer,PolicyPeriodInMinutes=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "NewGameSessionsPerCreator": integer,
            "PolicyPeriodInMinutes": integer
          }

       --metric-groups (list)
          The  name of a metric group to add this fleet to. Use a metric group
          in Amazon CloudWatch to aggregate the metrics from multiple  fleets.
          Provide  an existing metric group name, or create a new metric group
          by providing a new name. A fleet can only be in one metric group  at
          a time.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FleetId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet that was updated.
