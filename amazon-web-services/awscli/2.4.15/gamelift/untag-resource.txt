UNTAG-RESOURCE()                                              UNTAG-RESOURCE()



NAME
       untag-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  a  tag  that is assigned to a GameLift resource. Resource tags
       are used to organize AWS resources for a range of purposes. This opera-
       tion handles the permissions necessary to manage tags for the following
       GameLift resource types:

       o Build

       o Script

       o Fleet

       o Alias

       o GameSessionQueue

       o MatchmakingConfiguration

       o MatchmakingRuleSet

       To remove a tag from a resource, specify the unique ARN value  for  the
       resource  and  provide  a string list containing one or more tags to be
       removed. This operation succeeds even if the list  includes  tags  that
       are not currently assigned to the specified resource.

SYNOPSIS
            untag-resource
          --resource-arn <value>
          --tag-keys <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is  assigned  to  and  uniquely
          identifies  the GameLift resource that you want to remove tags from.
          GameLift resource ARNs are included  in  the  data  object  for  the
          resource, which can be retrieved by calling a List or Describe oper-
          ation for the resource type.

       --tag-keys (list)
          A list of one or more tag keys to remove from the specified GameLift
          resource.  An AWS resource can have only one tag with a specific tag
          key, so specifying the tag key identifies which tag to remove.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
