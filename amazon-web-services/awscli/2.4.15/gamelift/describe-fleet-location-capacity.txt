DESCRIBE-FLEET-LOCATION-CAPACITY()          DESCRIBE-FLEET-LOCATION-CAPACITY()



NAME
       describe-fleet-location-capacity -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the resource capacity settings for a fleet location. The data
       returned includes the current capacity (number of  EC2  instances)  and
       some scaling settings for the requested fleet location. Use this opera-
       tion to retrieve capacity information for a fleet's remote location  or
       home  Region  (you  can  also  retrieve home Region capacity by calling
       DescribeFleetCapacity ).

       To retrieve capacity data, identify a fleet and location.

       If successful, a FleetCapacity object is  returned  for  the  requested
       fleet location.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-fleet-location-capacity
          --fleet-id <value>
          --location <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A  unique identifier for the fleet to request location capacity for.
          You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --location (string)
          The fleet location to retrieve capacity information for.  Specify  a
          location in the form of an AWS Region code, such as us-west-2 .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FleetCapacity -> (structure)
          Resource  capacity  information  for  the  requested fleet location.
          Capacity objects are returned only for  fleets  and  locations  that
          currently exist.

          FleetId -> (string)
              A  unique identifier for the fleet associated with the location.

          FleetArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to  a  GameLift
              fleet  resource  and  uniquely  identifies  it.  ARNs are unique
              across         all          Regions.          Format          is
              arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912
              .

          InstanceType -> (string)
              The EC2 instance type that is used for all instances in a fleet.
              The  instance  type  determines  the computing resources in use,
              including CPU, memory, storage,  and  networking  capacity.  See
              Amazon EC2 Instance Types for detailed descriptions.

          InstanceCounts -> (structure)
              The  current  instance count and capacity settings for the fleet
              location.

              DESIRED -> (integer)
                 Ideal number of active instances. GameLift will always try to
                 maintain  the desired number of instances. Capacity is scaled
                 up or down by changing the desired instances.

              MINIMUM -> (integer)
                 The minimum instance count value allowed.

              MAXIMUM -> (integer)
                 The maximum instance count value allowed.

              PENDING -> (integer)
                 Number of instances that are starting but not yet active.

              ACTIVE -> (integer)
                 Actual number of instances that are ready to host  game  ses-
                 sions.

              IDLE -> (integer)
                 Number  of  active instances that are not currently hosting a
                 game session.

              TERMINATING -> (integer)
                 Number of instances that are no longer active but haven't yet
                 been terminated.

          Location -> (string)
              The fleet location for the instance count information, expressed
              as an AWS Region code, such as us-west-2 .
