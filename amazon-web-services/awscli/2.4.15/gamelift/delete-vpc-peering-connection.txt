NAME
       delete-vpc-peering-connection -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  a  VPC  peering connection. To delete the connection, you must
       have a valid authorization for the VPC peering connection that you want
       to   delete.   You   can   check   for   an  authorization  by  calling
       DescribeVpcPeeringAuthorizations or request a  new  one  using   Creat-
       eVpcPeeringAuthorization .

       Once  a  valid  authorization  exists, call this operation from the AWS
       account that is used to manage the Amazon GameLift fleets. Identify the
       connection  to delete by the connection ID and fleet ID. If successful,
       the connection is removed.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-vpc-peering-connection
          --fleet-id <value>
          --vpc-peering-connection-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier for the fleet. This fleet specified must match
          the fleet referenced in the VPC peering connection record.  You  can
          use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --vpc-peering-connection-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for  a  VPC peering connection. This value is
          included in the  VpcPeeringConnection object, which can be retrieved
          by calling  DescribeVpcPeeringConnections .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
