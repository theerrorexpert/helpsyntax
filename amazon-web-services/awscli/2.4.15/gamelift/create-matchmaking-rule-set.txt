CREATE-MATCHMAKING-RULE-SET()                    CREATE-MATCHMAKING-RULE-SET()



NAME
       create-matchmaking-rule-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a new rule set for FlexMatch matchmaking. A rule set describes
       the type of match to create, such as the number and size of  teams.  It
       also sets the parameters for acceptable player matches, such as minimum
       skill level or character type. A rule set is used by a  MatchmakingCon-
       figuration .

       To  create a matchmaking rule set, provide unique rule set name and the
       rule set body in JSON format. Rule sets must be  defined  in  the  same
       Region as the matchmaking configuration they are used with.

       Since  matchmaking  rule  sets  cannot  be edited, it is a good idea to
       check the rule set syntax using  ValidateMatchmakingRuleSet before cre-
       ating a new rule set.

SYNOPSIS
            create-matchmaking-rule-set
          --name <value>
          --rule-set-body <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          A unique identifier for the matchmaking rule set. A matchmaking con-
          figuration identifies the rule set it uses by this name value.  Note
          that  the rule set name is different from the optional name field in
          the rule set body.

       --rule-set-body (string)
          A collection of matchmaking rules, formatted as a JSON string.  Com-
          ments  are not allowed in JSON, but most elements support a descrip-
          tion field.

       --tags (list)
          A list of labels to assign to the new matchmaking rule set resource.
          Tags  are  developer-defined  key-value pairs. Tagging AWS resources
          are useful for resource management, access management and cost allo-
          cation.  For  more information, see Tagging AWS Resources in the AWS
          General Reference . Once  the  resource  is  created,  you  can  use
          TagResource  ,   UntagResource  ,  and   ListTagsForResource to add,
          remove, and view tags. The maximum  tag  limit  may  be  lower  than
          stated. See the AWS General Reference for actual tagging limits.

          (structure)
              A label that can be assigned to a GameLift resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for a developer-defined key:value pair for tagging an
                 AWS resource.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value for a developer-defined key:value pair for tagging
                 an AWS resource.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RuleSet -> (structure)
          The newly created matchmaking rule set.

          RuleSetName -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the matchmaking rule set

          RuleSetArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to  a  GameLift
              matchmaking  rule  set resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs
              are     unique     across     all     Regions.     Format     is
              arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::matchmakingruleset/<ruleset  name>  .
              In a GameLift rule set ARN, the resource ID matches the RuleSet-
              Name value.

          RuleSetBody -> (string)
              A  collection  of matchmaking rules, formatted as a JSON string.
              Comments are not allowed in JSON, but most  elements  support  a
              description field.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A  time stamp indicating when this data object was created. For-
              mat is a number expressed in  Unix  time  as  milliseconds  (for
              example "1469498468.057" ).
