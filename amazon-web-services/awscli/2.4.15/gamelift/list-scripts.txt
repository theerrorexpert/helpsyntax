       list-scripts is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: Scripts

SYNOPSIS
            list-scripts
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Scripts -> (list)
          A set of properties describing the requested script.

          (structure)
              Properties describing a Realtime script.

              ScriptId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the Realtime script

              ScriptArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN  )  that  is  assigned  to  a
                 GameLift script resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are
                 unique across all Regions. In  a  GameLift  script  ARN,  the
                 resource ID matches the ScriptId value.

              Name -> (string)
                 A  descriptive label that is associated with a script. Script
                 names do not need to be unique.

              Version -> (string)
                 Version information  that  is  associated  with  a  build  or
                 script. Version strings do not need to be unique.

              SizeOnDisk -> (long)
                 The  file  size of the uploaded Realtime script, expressed in
                 bytes. When files are uploaded  from  an  S3  location,  this
                 value remains at "0".

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  time  stamp  indicating when this data object was created.
                 Format is a number expressed in  Unix  time  as  milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              StorageLocation -> (structure)
                 The  location  in  Amazon  S3 where build or script files are
                 stored for access by Amazon GameLift. This location is speci-
                 fied  in   CreateBuild  ,   CreateScript  , and  UpdateScript
                 requests.

                 Bucket -> (string)
                     An Amazon S3 bucket identifier. This is the name  of  the
                     S3 bucket.

                     NOTE:
                        GameLift  currently  does  not  support uploading from
                        Amazon S3 buckets with names that contain a dot (.).

                 Key -> (string)
                     The name of the zip file that contains the build files or
                     script files.

                 RoleArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN  ) for an IAM role that
                     allows Amazon GameLift to access the S3 bucket.

                 ObjectVersion -> (string)
                     The version of the file, if object versioning  is  turned
                     on  for the bucket. Amazon GameLift uses this information
                     when retrieving files from an S3 bucket that you own. Use
                     this parameter to specify a specific version of the file.
                     If not set, the latest version of the file is  retrieved.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates  where to resume retrieving results on the
          next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these  results
          represent the end of the list.
