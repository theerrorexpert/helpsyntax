NAME
       describe-vpc-peering-connections -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information on VPC peering connections. Use this operation to
       get peering information for all fleets or for one specific fleet ID.

       To retrieve connection information, call this operation  from  the  AWS
       account  that  is  used to manage the Amazon GameLift fleets. Specify a
       fleet ID or leave  the  parameter  empty  to  retrieve  all  connection
       records.  If successful, the retrieved information includes both active
       and pending connections. Active  connections  identify  the  IpV4  CIDR
       block that the VPC uses to connect.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-vpc-peering-connections
          [--fleet-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet. You can use either the  fleet  ID
          or ARN value.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       VpcPeeringConnections -> (list)
          A  collection  of  VPC  peering  connection  records  that match the
          request.

          (structure)
              Represents a peering connection between a VPC on one of your AWS
              accounts  and  the  VPC  for  your  Amazon GameLift fleets. This
              record may be for an active peering connection or a pending con-
              nection that has not yet been established.

              FleetId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the fleet. This ID determines the  ID
                 of the Amazon GameLift VPC for your fleet.

              FleetArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) associated with the GameLift
                 fleet resource for this connection.

              IpV4CidrBlock -> (string)
                 CIDR block of IPv4 addresses assigned to the VPC peering con-
                 nection for the GameLift VPC. The peered VPC also has an IPv4
                 CIDR block associated with it; these blocks cannot overlap or
                 the peering connection cannot be created.

              VpcPeeringConnectionId -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier  that  is automatically assigned to the
                 connection record. This ID is referenced in VPC peering  con-
                 nection  events,  and is used when deleting a connection with
                 DeleteVpcPeeringConnection .

              Status -> (structure)
                 The status information about the connection. Status indicates
                 if a connection is pending, successful, or failed.

                 Code -> (string)
                     Code indicating the status of a VPC peering connection.

                 Message -> (string)
                     Additional  messaging associated with the connection sta-
                     tus.

              PeerVpcId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for a VPC with resources to  be  accessed
                 by your GameLift fleet. The VPC must be in the same Region as
                 your fleet. To look up a VPC ID, use the VPC Dashboard in the
                 AWS  Management  Console. Learn more about VPC peering in VPC
                 Peering with GameLift Fleets .

              GameLiftVpcId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the  VPC  that  contains  the  Amazon
                 GameLift  fleet  for  this connection. This VPC is managed by
                 Amazon GameLift and does not appear in your AWS account.
