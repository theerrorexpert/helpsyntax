DESCRIBE-FLEET-UTILIZATION()                      DESCRIBE-FLEET-UTILIZATION()



NAME
       describe-fleet-utilization -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  utilization  statistics  for one or more fleets. Utilization
       data provides a snapshot of how the fleet's hosting resources are  cur-
       rently  being  used.  For  fleets with remote locations, this operation
       retrieves data for the fleet's home Region only. See   DescribeFleetLo-
       cationUtilization  to  get  utilization statistics for a fleet's remote
       locations.

       This operation can be used in the following ways:

       o To get utilization data for one or more specific  fleets,  provide  a
         list of fleet IDs or fleet ARNs.

       o To  get utilization data for all fleets, do not provide a fleet iden-
         tifier.

       When requesting multiple  fleets,  use  the  pagination  parameters  to
       retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.

       If   successful,  a   FleetUtilization  object  is  returned  for  each
       requested fleet ID, unless the fleet  identifier  is  not  found.  Each
       fleet  utilization object includes a Location property, which is set to
       the fleet's home Region.

       NOTE:
              Some API operations may limit the number of fleet IDs allowed in
              one  request. If a request exceeds this limit, the request fails
              and the error message includes the maximum allowed.

       describe-fleet-utilization is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: FleetUtilization

SYNOPSIS
            describe-fleet-utilization
          [--fleet-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-ids (list)
          A  unique  identifier  for the fleet(s) to retrieve utilization data
          for. You can use either the fleet  ID  or  ARN  value.  To  retrieve
          attributes for all current fleets, do not include this parameter.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example1: To view usage data for a list of fleets

       The  following  describe-fleet-utilization  example  retrieves  current
       usage information for one specified fleet.

          aws gamelift describe-fleet-utilization \
              --fleet-ids arn:aws:gamelift:us-west-2::fleet/fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111

       Output:

          {
              "FleetUtilization": [
                  {
                  "FleetId": "fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                  "ActiveServerProcessCount": 100,
                  "ActiveGameSessionCount": 62,
                  "CurrentPlayerSessionCount": 329,
                  "MaximumPlayerSessionCount": 1000
                  }
              ]
          }

       Example2: To request usage data for all fleets

       The  following  describe-fleet-utilization returns fleet usage data for
       all fleets with any status. This example uses pagination parameters  to
       return data for two fleets at a time.

          aws gamelift describe-fleet-utilization \
              --limit 2

       Output:

          {
              "FleetUtilization": [
                  {
                      "FleetId": "fleet-1111aaaa-22bb-33cc-44dd-5555eeee66ff",
                      "ActiveServerProcessCount": 100,
                      "ActiveGameSessionCount": 13,
                      "CurrentPlayerSessionCount": 98,
                      "MaximumPlayerSessionCount": 1000
                  },
                  {
                      "FleetId": "fleet-2222bbbb-33cc-44dd-55ee-6666ffff77aa",
                      "ActiveServerProcessCount": 100,
                      "ActiveGameSessionCount": 62,
                      "CurrentPlayerSessionCount": 329,
                      "MaximumPlayerSessionCount": 1000
                  }
              ],
              "NextToken": "eyJhd3NBY2NvdW50SWQiOnsicyI6IjMwMjc3NjAxNjM5OCJ9LCJidWlsZElkIjp7InMiOiJidWlsZC01NWYxZTZmMS1jY2FlLTQ3YTctOWI5ZS1iYjFkYTQwMjEXAMPLE2"
          }

       Call  the  command  a  second  time, passing the NextToken value as the
       argument to the --next-token parameter to see the next two results.

          aws gamelift describe-fleet-utilization \
              --limit 2 \
              --next-token eyJhd3NBY2NvdW50SWQiOnsicyI6IjMwMjc3NjAxNjM5OCJ9LCJidWlsZElkIjp7InMiOiJidWlsZC01NWYxZTZmMS1jY2FlLTQ3YTctOWI5ZS1iYjFkYTQwMjEXAMPLE2

       Repeat until the response no longer includes a NextToken value  in  the
       output.

       GameLift Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       FleetUtilization -> (list)
          A collection of objects containing utilization information for  each
          requested fleet ID. Utilization objects are returned only for fleets
          that currently exist.

          (structure)
              Current resource utilization statistics in a specified fleet  or
