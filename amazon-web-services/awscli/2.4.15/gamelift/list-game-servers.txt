LIST-GAME-SERVERS()                                        LIST-GAME-SERVERS()



NAME
       list-game-servers -

DESCRIPTION
          This  operation  is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game
          server groups.

       Retrieves information on all game servers that are currently active  in
       a  specified  game  server  group. You can opt to sort the list by game
       server age. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results in a  set
       of sequential segments.

       list-game-servers  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: GameServers

SYNOPSIS
            list-game-servers
          --game-server-group-name <value>
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --game-server-group-name (string)
          An identifier for the game server group to retrieve a list  of  game
          servers from. Use either the  GameServerGroup name or ARN value.

       --sort-order (string)
          Indicates  how to sort the returned data based on game server regis-
          tration timestamp. Use ASCENDING to  retrieve  oldest  game  servers
          first,  or  use DESCENDING to retrieve newest game servers first. If
          this parameter is left empty, game servers are returned in  no  par-
          ticular order.

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GameServers -> (list)
          A collection of game server objects that match the request.

          (structure)
                 This data type is used with the  GameLift  FleetIQ  and  game
                 server groups.

              Properties  describing  a  game  server  that  is  running on an
              instance in a  GameServerGroup .

              A game server is created by a successful call  to  RegisterGame-
              Server  and  deleted  by  calling  DeregisterGameServer . A game
              server is claimed to host a game session by  calling  ClaimGame-
              Server .

              GameServerGroupName -> (string)
                 A  unique identifier for the game server group where the game
                 server is running. Use either the   GameServerGroup  name  or
                 ARN value.

              GameServerGroupArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  identifier for the game server group where the game
                 server is located.

              GameServerId -> (string)
                 A custom string that uniquely  identifies  the  game  server.
                 Game  server  IDs are developer-defined and are unique across
                 all game server groups in an AWS account.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the instance where the game  server
                 is  running.  This  ID is available in the instance metadata.
                 EC2 instance IDs use  a  17-character  format,  for  example:
                 i-1234567890abcdef0 .

              ConnectionInfo -> (string)
                 The  port  and  IP  address  that must be used to establish a
                 client connection to the game server.

              GameServerData -> (string)
                 A set of custom game server properties, formatted as a single
                 string value. This data is passed to a game client or service
                 when it requests information on game servers using  ListGame-
                 Servers or  ClaimGameServer .

              ClaimStatus -> (string)
                 Indicates when an available game server has been reserved for
                 gameplay but has not yet started hosting a game. Once  it  is
                 claimed, the game server remains in CLAIMED status for a max-
                 imum of one minute. During this time, game clients connect to
                 the game server to start the game and trigger the game server
                 to update its utilization status. After one minute, the  game
                 server claim status reverts to null.

              UtilizationStatus -> (string)
                 Indicates  whether the game server is currently available for
                 new games or is busy. Possible statuses include:

                 o AVAILABLE - The game server is available to be  claimed.  A
                   game  server  that  has been claimed remains in this status
                   until it reports game hosting activity.

                 o UTILIZED - The game server is currently hosting a game ses-
                   sion with players.

              RegistrationTime -> (timestamp)
                 Timestamp  that  indicates  when  the game server was created
                 with a  RegisterGameServer request. The format  is  a  number
                 expressed   in   Unix   time  as  milliseconds  (for  example
                 "1469498468.057" ).

              LastClaimTime -> (timestamp)
                 Timestamp that indicates the last time the  game  server  was
                 claimed with a  ClaimGameServer request. The format is a num-
                 ber expressed in  Unix  time  as  milliseconds  (for  example
                 "1469498468.057"  ).  This  value is used to calculate when a
                 claimed game server's status should revert to null.

              LastHealthCheckTime -> (timestamp)
                 Timestamp that indicates the last time the  game  server  was
                 updated   with   health  status  using  an   UpdateGameServer
                 request. The format is a number expressed  in  Unix  time  as
                 milliseconds  (for  example  "1469498468.057"  ).  After game
                 server registration, this property is  only  changed  when  a
                 game server update specifies a health check value.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates  where to resume retrieving results on the
          next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these  results
          represent the end of the list.
