NAME
       describe-scaling-policies -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves all scaling policies applied to a fleet.

       To get a fleet's scaling policies, specify the fleet ID. You can filter
       this request by policy status, such as to retrieve only active  scaling
       policies. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of
       sequential pages. If  successful,  set  of   ScalingPolicy  objects  is
       returned for the fleet.

       A  fleet  may have all of its scaling policies suspended ( StopFleetAc-
       tions ). This operation does not affect the status of the scaling poli-
       cies,  which  remains ACTIVE. To see whether a fleet's scaling policies
       are in force or suspended, call  DescribeFleetAttributes and check  the
       stopped actions.

       describe-scaling-policies is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: ScalingPolicies

SYNOPSIS
            describe-scaling-policies
          --fleet-id <value>
          [--status-filter <value>]
          [--location <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A  unique identifier for the fleet to retrieve scaling policies for.
          You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --status-filter (string)
          Scaling policy status to filter results on. A scaling policy is only
          in force when in an ACTIVE status.

          o ACTIVE -- The scaling policy is currently in force.

          o UPDATEREQUESTED -- A request to update the scaling policy has been
            received.

          o UPDATING -- A change is being made to the scaling policy.

          o DELETEREQUESTED -- A request to delete the scaling policy has been
            received.

          o DELETING -- The scaling policy is being deleted.

          o DELETED -- The scaling policy has been deleted.

          o ERROR  --  An  error occurred in creating the policy. It should be
            removed and recreated.

          Possible values:

          o ACTIVE

          o UPDATE_REQUESTED

          o UPDATING

          o DELETE_REQUESTED

          o DELETING

          o DELETED

          o ERROR

       --location (string)
          CONTENT TODO

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ScalingPolicies -> (list)
          A collection of objects containing the scaling policies matching the
          request.

          (structure)
              Rule that controls how a fleet is scaled. Scaling  policies  are
              uniquely identified by the combination of name and fleet ID.

              Status -> (string)
                 Current status of the scaling policy. The scaling policy  can
                 be  in  force only when in an ACTIVE status. Scaling policies
                 can be suspended for individual fleets (see  StopFleetActions
                 ;  if  suspended  for  a  fleet,  the  policy status does not
                 change.  View  a   fleet's   stopped   actions   by   calling
                 DescribeFleetCapacity .

                 o ERROR -- An error  occurred  in  creating  the  policy.  It
                   should be removed and recreated.

              ScalingAdjustment -> (integer)
                 Amount of adjustment to make, based on the scaling adjustment
                 type.

              ScalingAdjustmentType -> (string)
                 The type of adjustment to make to a  fleet's  instance  count
                 (see  FleetCapacity ):

                 o ChangeInCapacity  --  add (or subtract) the scaling adjust-
                   ment value from the current instance count. Positive values
                   scale up while negative values scale down.

                 o ExactCapacity  --  set  the  instance  count to the scaling
                   adjustment value.

                 o PercentChangeInCapacity -- increase or reduce  the  current
                   instance  count  by  the scaling adjustment, read as a per-
                   centage. Positive values scale  up  while  negative  values
                   scale down.

              ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                 Comparison  operator  to  use when measuring a metric against
                 the threshold value.

              Threshold -> (double)
                 Metric value used to trigger a scaling event.

              EvaluationPeriods -> (integer)

                 the threshold before a scaling event is triggered.

              MetricName -> (string)
                 Name  of  the  Amazon GameLift-defined metric that is used to
                 trigger a scaling adjustment. For  detailed  descriptions  of
                 fleet metrics, see Monitor Amazon GameLift with Amazon Cloud-
                 Watch .

                 o ActivatingGameSessions -- Game sessions in the  process  of
                   being created.

                 o ActiveGameSessions -- Game sessions that are currently run-
                   ning.

                 o ActiveInstances -- Fleet instances that are currently  run-
                   ning at least one game session.

                 o AvailableGameSessions  --  Additional  game  sessions  that
                   fleet could host simultaneously, given current capacity.

                 o AvailablePlayerSessions -- Empty player slots in  currently
                   active  game sessions. This includes game sessions that are
                   not currently accepting players. Reserved player slots  are
                   not included.

                 o CurrentPlayerSessions  --  Player slots in active game ses-
                   sions that are being used by a player or are reserved for a
                   player.

                 o IdleInstances  -- Active instances that are currently host-
                   ing zero game sessions.

                 o PercentAvailableGameSessions -- Unused  percentage  of  the
                   total  number  of  game  sessions  that  a fleet could host
                   simultaneously, given current capacity. Use this metric for
                   a target-based scaling policy.

                 o PercentIdleInstances  --  Percentage of the total number of
                   active instances that are hosting zero game sessions.

                 o QueueDepth -- Pending game session placement  requests,  in
                   any queue, where the current fleet is the top-priority des-
                   tination.

                 o WaitTime -- Current wait  time  for  pending  game  session
                   placement  requests,  in any queue, where the current fleet
                   is the top-priority destination.

              PolicyType -> (string)
                 The type of scaling policy to create. For a target-based pol-
                 icy,  set  the parameter MetricName to 'PercentAvailableGame-
                 Sessions'  and  specify  a  TargetConfiguration   .   For   a
                 rule-based  policy set the following parameters: MetricName ,
                 ComparisonOperator , Threshold , EvaluationPeriods ,  Scalin-
                 gAdjustmentType , and ScalingAdjustment .

              TargetConfiguration -> (structure)
                 An  object  that contains settings for a target-based scaling
                 policy.

                 TargetValue -> (double)
                     Desired value to use with a target-based scaling  policy.
                     The  value must be relevant for whatever metric the scal-
                     ing policy is using. For example, in a policy  using  the
                     metric  PercentAvailableGameSessions,  the  target  value
                     should be the preferred size of the fleet's  buffer  (the
                     percent of capacity that should be idle and ready for new
                     game sessions).

              UpdateStatus -> (string)
                 The current status of  the  fleet's  scaling  policies  in  a
                 requested fleet location. The status PENDING_UPDATE indicates
                 that an update was requested for the fleet but  has  not  yet
                 been completed for the location.

              Location -> (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates  where to resume retrieving results on the
          next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these  results
          represent the end of the list.
