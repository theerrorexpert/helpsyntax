NAME
       describe-game-session-queues -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  properties  for  one  or more game session queues. When
       requesting multiple queues, use the pagination parameters  to  retrieve
       results  as  a  set of sequential pages. If successful, a  GameSession-
       Queue object is returned for each requested queue.  When  specifying  a
       list  of  queues,  objects  are returned only for queues that currently
       exist in the Region.

       describe-game-session-queues is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: GameSessionQueues

SYNOPSIS
            describe-game-session-queues
          [--names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --names (list)
          A  list  of  queue  names  to  retrieve information for. You can use
          either the queue ID or  ARN  value.  To  request  settings  for  all
          queues, leave this parameter empty.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GameSessionQueues -> (list)
          A collection of objects that describe  the  requested  game  session
          queues.

          (structure)
              Configuration  for  a game session placement mechanism that pro-
              cesses requests for new game sessions. A queue can  be  used  on
              its own or as part of a matchmaking solution.

              Name -> (string)
                 A descriptive label that  is  associated  with  game  session
                 queue. Queue names must be unique within each Region.

              GameSessionQueueArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN  )  that  is  assigned to a
                 GameLift game session queue resource and uniquely  identifies
                 it.   ARNs   are   unique   across  all  Regions.  Format  is
                 arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::gamesessionqueue/<queue name> . In
                 a  GameLift  game  session queue ARN, the resource ID matches
                 the Name value.

              TimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The maximum time, in seconds, that a new game session  place-
                 ment  request  remains  in  the queue. When a request exceeds
                 this time, the game session placement changes to a  TIMED_OUT
                 status.

              PlayerLatencyPolicies -> (list)
                 A  set  of  policies  that  act  as  a  sliding cap on player
                 latency. FleetIQ works to deliver low latency for most  play-
                 ers in a game session. These policies ensure that no individ-
                 ual player can be placed into a game with  unreasonably  high
                 latency.  Use  multiple  policies  to gradually relax latency
                 requirements a step at a time. Multiple policies are  applied
                 based  on  their  maximum  allowed latency, starting with the
                 lowest value.

                 (structure)
                     Sets a latency cap for individual players when placing  a
                     game session. With a latency policy in force, a game ses-
                     sion cannot be placed in a fleet location where a  player
                     reports latency higher than the cap. Latency policies are
                     used only with  placement  request  that  provide  player
                     latency  information.  Player  latency  policies  can  be
                     stacked to  gradually  relax  latency  requirements  over
                     time.

                     Latency policies are part of a  GameSessionQueue .

                     MaximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds -> (integer)
                        The  maximum  latency  value  that  is allowed for any
                        player, in milliseconds.  All  policies  must  have  a
                        value set for this property.

                     PolicyDurationSeconds -> (integer)
                        The  length  of  time,  in seconds, that the policy is
                        enforced while placing a  new  game  session.  A  null
                        value  for  this  property  means  that  the policy is
                        enforced until the queue times out.

              Destinations -> (list)
                 A list of fleets and/or fleet aliases that  can  be  used  to
                 fulfill  game session placement requests in the queue. Desti-
                 nations are identified by either a fleet ARN or a fleet alias
                 ARN, and are listed in order of placement preference.

                 (structure)
                     A  fleet  or  alias  designated  in a game session queue.
                     Queues fulfill requests for new game sessions by  placing
                     a new game session on any of the queue's destinations.

                     Destinations are part of a  GameSessionQueue .

                     DestinationArn -> (string)
                        The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) that is assigned to
                        fleet or fleet alias. ARNs, which include a  fleet  ID
                        or  alias ID and a Region name, provide a unique iden-
                        tifier across all Regions.

              FilterConfiguration -> (structure)
                 A list of locations where a queue is  allowed  to  place  new
                 game  sessions.  Locations  are  specified in the form of AWS
                 Region codes, such as us-west-2 . If this  parameter  is  not
                 set, game sessions can be placed in any queue location.

                 AllowedLocations -> (list)
                     A  list  of locations to allow game session placement in,
                     in the form of AWS Region codes such as us-west-2 .

                     (string)

              PriorityConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Custom settings to use  when  prioritizing  destinations  and
                 locations  for  game  session  placements. This configuration
                 replaces the FleetIQ default prioritization process. Priority
                 types  that  are  not  explicitly named will be automatically
                 applied at the end of the prioritization process.

                 PriorityOrder -> (list)
                     The recommended sequence to use when  prioritizing  where
                     to  place new game sessions. Each type can only be listed
                     once.

                     o LATENCY --  FleetIQ  prioritizes  locations  where  the
                       average  player  latency (provided in each game session
                       request) is lowest.

                     o COST -- FleetIQ prioritizes destinations with the  low-
                       est  current  hosting costs. Cost is evaluated based on
                       the location, instance type, and fleet  type  (Spot  or
                       On-Demand) for each destination in the queue.

                     o DESTINATION  --  FleetIQ prioritizes based on the order
                       that destinations are listed in  the  queue  configura-
                       tion.

                     o LOCATION  --  FleetIQ prioritizes based on the provided
                       order of locations, as defined in LocationOrder .

                     (string)

                 LocationOrder -> (list)
                     The prioritization order to use for fleet locations, when
                     the  PriorityOrder property includes LOCATION . Locations
                     are identified by AWS Region codes such  as  us-west-2  .
                     Each location can only be listed once.

                     (string)

              CustomEventData -> (string)
                 Information  that  is added to all events that are related to
                 this game session queue.

              NotificationTarget -> (string)
                 An SNS topic ARN that is  set  up  to  receive  game  session
                 placement  notifications.  See  Setting  up notifications for
                 game session placement .

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates where to resume  retrieving  results  on  the
          next  call to this operation. If no token is returned, these results
          represent the end of the list.
