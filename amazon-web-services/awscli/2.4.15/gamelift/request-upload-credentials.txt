REQUEST-UPLOAD-CREDENTIALS()                      REQUEST-UPLOAD-CREDENTIALS()



NAME
       request-upload-credentials -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  fresh set of credentials for use when uploading a new set
       of game build files to Amazon GameLift's Amazon S3.  This  is  done  as
       part of the build creation process; see  CreateBuild .

       To  request  new  credentials, specify the build ID as returned with an
       initial CreateBuild request. If successful, a new  set  of  credentials
       are  returned,  along  with the S3 storage location associated with the
       build ID.

SYNOPSIS
            request-upload-credentials
          --build-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --build-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for the build to get credentials for. You can
          use either the build ID or ARN value.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To refresh access credentials for uploading a build

       The following create-build example obtains new,  valid  access  creden-
       tials  for  uploading  a  GameLift build file to an Amazon S3 location.
       Credentials have a limited life span. You get the  build  ID  from  the
       response to the original CreateBuild request.

          aws gamelift request-upload-credentials \
              --build-id build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111

       Output:

          {
              "StorageLocation": {
                  "Bucket": "gamelift-builds-us-west-2",
                  "Key": "123456789012/build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"

              }
          }

OUTPUT
       UploadCredentials -> (structure)
          AWS credentials required when uploading a game build to the  storage
          location.  These  credentials  have a limited lifespan and are valid
          only for the build they were issued for.

          AccessKeyId -> (string)
              Temporary key allowing access to the Amazon GameLift S3 account.

          SecretAccessKey -> (string)
              Temporary  secret  key allowing access to the Amazon GameLift S3
              account.

          SessionToken -> (string)
              Token used to associate a  specific  build  ID  with  the  files
              uploaded using these credentials.

       StorageLocation -> (structure)
          Amazon  S3  path and key, identifying where the game build files are
          stored.

          Bucket -> (string)
              An Amazon S3 bucket identifier. This  is  the  name  of  the  S3
              bucket.

              NOTE:
                 GameLift  currently does not support uploading from Amazon S3
                 buckets with names that contain a dot (.).

          Key -> (string)
              The name of the zip file that contains the build files or script
              files.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) for an IAM role that allows Ama-
              zon GameLift to access the S3 bucket.

          ObjectVersion -> (string)
              The version of the file, if object versioning is turned  on  for
              the  bucket. Amazon GameLift uses this information when retriev-
              ing files from an S3 bucket that you own. Use this parameter  to
              specify  a  specific version of the file. If not set, the latest
              version of the file is retrieved.
