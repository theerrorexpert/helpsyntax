LIST-ALIASES()                                                  LIST-ALIASES()



NAME
       list-aliases -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  all  aliases for this AWS account. You can filter the result
       set by alias name and/or routing  strategy  type.  Use  the  pagination
       parameters to retrieve results in sequential pages.

       NOTE:
              Returned aliases are not listed in any particular order.

       list-aliases is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the  results  of  the  following  query
       expressions: Aliases

SYNOPSIS
            list-aliases
          [--routing-strategy-type <value>]
          [--name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --routing-strategy-type (string)
          The  routing  type  to  filter  results  on.  Use  this parameter to
          retrieve only aliases with a certain routing type. To  retrieve  all
          aliases, leave this parameter empty.

          Possible routing types include the following:

          o SIMPLE  -- The alias resolves to one specific fleet. Use this type
            when routing to active fleets.

          o TERMINAL -- The alias does not resolve to a fleet but instead  can
            be  used to display a message to the user. A terminal alias throws
            a TerminalRoutingStrategyException with the  RoutingStrategy  mes-
            sage embedded.

          Possible values:

          o SIMPLE

          o TERMINAL

       --name (string)
          A descriptive label that is associated with an alias. Alias names do
          not need to be unique.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Aliases -> (list)
          A collection of alias resources that match the request parameters.

          (structure)
              Properties that describe an alias resource.

                     task

              AliasId -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier  for  the  alias.  Alias IDs are unique
                 within a Region.

              Name -> (string)
                 A descriptive label that is associated with an  alias.  Alias
                 names do not need to be unique.

              AliasArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN  )  that  is  assigned to a
                 GameLift alias resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs  are
                 unique      across      all      Regions.      Format      is
                 arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::alias/alias-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912
                 .  In a GameLift alias ARN, the resource ID matches the alias
                 ID value.

              Description -> (string)
                 A human-readable description of an alias.

              RoutingStrategy -> (structure)
                 The routing configuration, including routing type  and  fleet
                 target, for the alias.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The type of routing strategy for the alias.

                     Possible routing types include the following:

                     o SIMPLE  - The alias resolves to one specific fleet. Use
                       this type when routing to active fleets.

                     o TERMINAL - The alias does not resolve to  a  fleet  but
                       instead can be used to display a message to the user. A
                       terminal alias throws  a  TerminalRoutingStrategyExcep-
                       tion with the  RoutingStrategy message embedded.

                 FleetId -> (string)
                     A  unique  identifier for the fleet that the alias points
                     to. This value is the fleet ID, not the fleet ARN.

                 Message -> (string)
                     The message text to  be  used  with  a  terminal  routing
                     strategy.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  time  stamp  indicating when this data object was created.
                 Format is a number expressed in  Unix  time  as  milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that this data object was last modified. Format is a
                 number expressed in Unix time as  milliseconds  (for  example
                 "1469498468.057" ).

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates  where to resume retrieving results on the
          next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these  results
          represent the end of the list.
