UPDATE-GAME-SERVER-GROUP()                          UPDATE-GAME-SERVER-GROUP()



NAME
       update-game-server-group -

DESCRIPTION
          This  operation  is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game
          server groups.

       Updates GameLift FleetIQ-specific properties for a game  server  group.
       Many  Auto  Scaling  group  properties  are updated on the Auto Scaling
       group directly, including the launch template, Auto  Scaling  policies,
       and maximum/minimum/desired instance counts.

       To  update  the game server group, specify the game server group ID and
       provide the updated values. Before applying the updates, the new values
       are  validated  to ensure that GameLift FleetIQ can continue to perform
       instance balancing activity. If successful, a   GameServerGroup  object
       is returned.

SYNOPSIS
            update-game-server-group
          --game-server-group-name <value>
          [--role-arn <value>]
          [--instance-definitions <value>]
          [--game-server-protection-policy <value>]
          [--balancing-strategy <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --game-server-group-name (string)
          A unique identifier for the game server group. Use either the  Game-
          ServerGroup name or ARN value.

       --role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN ) for an IAM role that allows Amazon
          GameLift to access your EC2 Auto Scaling groups.

       --instance-definitions (list)
          An updated list of EC2 instance types to use  in  the  Auto  Scaling
          group.  The instance definitions must specify at least two different
          instance types that are supported by GameLift FleetIQ. This  updated
          list  replaces  the  entire current list of instance definitions for
          the game server group. For more information on instance  types,  see
          EC2 Instance Types in the Amazon EC2 User Guide . You can optionally
          specify capacity weighting for each  instance  type.  If  no  weight
          value  is  specified  for an instance type, it is set to the default
          value "1".  For  more  information  about  capacity  weighting,  see
          Instance  Weighting  for  Amazon  EC2 Auto Scaling in the Amazon EC2
          Auto Scaling User Guide.

          (structure)
                 This data type is used with the  GameLift  FleetIQ  and  game
                 server groups.

              An  allowed  instance  type  for  a   GameServerGroup . All game
              server groups must have at least two instance types defined  for
              it.   GameLift   FleetIQ  periodically  evaluates  each  defined
              instance type for viability. It then updates  the  Auto  Scaling
              group with the list of viable instance types.

              InstanceType -> (string)
                 An EC2 instance type designation.

              WeightedCapacity -> (string)
                 Instance weighting that indicates how much this instance type
                 contributes to the total capacity of  a  game  server  group.
                 Instance  weights  are  used by GameLift FleetIQ to calculate
                 the instance type's cost per unit hour  and  better  identify
                 the  most cost-effective options. For detailed information on
                 weighting instance capacity, see Instance  Weighting  in  the
                 Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide . Default value is "1".

            ...
          ]

       --game-server-protection-policy (string)
          A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group are
          protected from early termination. Unprotected  instances  that  have
          active  game servers running might be terminated during a scale-down
          event, causing players  to  be  dropped  from  the  game.  Protected
          instances  cannot  be terminated while there are active game servers
          running except in the event of a forced game server  group  deletion
          (see  ).  An  exception to this is with Spot Instances, which can be
          terminated by AWS regardless of protection status. This property  is
          set to NO_PROTECTION by default.

          Possible values:

          o NO_PROTECTION

          o FULL_PROTECTION

       --balancing-strategy (string)
          Indicates  how  GameLift  FleetIQ balances the use of Spot Instances
          and On-Demand Instances in the game  server  group.  Method  options
          include the following:

          o SPOT_ONLY - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server group.
            If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game  hosting,
            the  game  server  group  provides  no hosting capacity until Spot
            Instances can again be used. Until  then,  no  new  instances  are
            started,  and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated
            (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced.

          o SPOT_PREFERRED - (default value) Spot Instances are used  whenever
            available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavail-
            able, the game server group continues to provide hosting  capacity
            by  falling  back  to On-Demand Instances. Existing nonviable Spot
            Instances are terminated (after current  gameplay  ends)  and  are
            replaced with new On-Demand Instances.

          o ON_DEMAND_ONLY  -  Only  On-Demand  Instances are used in the game
            server group. No Spot Instances are  used,  even  when  available,
            while this balancing strategy is in force.

          Possible values:

          o SPOT_ONLY

          o SPOT_PREFERRED

          o ON_DEMAND_ONLY

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              (structure)
                     This data type is used with the GameLift FleetIQ and game
                     server groups.

                 An  allowed  instance  type for a  GameServerGroup . All game
                 server groups must have at least two instance  types  defined
                 for  it. GameLift FleetIQ periodically evaluates each defined
                 instance type for viability. It then updates the Auto Scaling
                 group with the list of viable instance types.

                 InstanceType -> (string)
                     An EC2 instance type designation.

                 WeightedCapacity -> (string)
                     Instance  weighting that indicates how much this instance
                     type contributes to the total capacity of a  game  server
                     group.  Instance  weights are used by GameLift FleetIQ to
                     calculate the instance type's cost per unit hour and bet-
                     ter   identify   the  most  cost-effective  options.  For
                     detailed information on weighting instance capacity,  see
                     Instance  Weighting  in  the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User
                     Guide . Default value is "1".

          BalancingStrategy -> (string)
              Indicates  how  GameLift  FleetIQ  balances  the  use  of   Spot
              Instances  and  On-Demand  Instances  in  the game server group.
              Method options include the following:

              o SPOT_ONLY - Only Spot Instances are used in  the  game  server
                group.  If  Spot  Instances  are unavailable or not viable for
                game hosting, the game server group provides no hosting capac-
                ity until Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new
                instances  are  started,  and  the  existing  nonviable   Spot
                Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are
                not replaced.

              o SPOT_PREFERRED - (default value) Spot Instances are used when-
                ever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are
                unavailable, the game server group continues to provide  host-
                ing  capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing
                nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after  current  game-
                play ends) and are replaced with new On-Demand Instances.

              o ON_DEMAND_ONLY - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game
                server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available,
                while this balancing strategy is in force.

          GameServerProtectionPolicy -> (string)
              A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group
              are protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that
              have  active  game  servers running might be terminated during a
              scale-down event, causing players to be dropped from  the  game.
              Protected  instances cannot be terminated while there are active
              game servers running except in the event of a forced game server
              group  deletion  (see  ).  An  exception  to  this  is with Spot
              Instances, which can be terminated by AWS regardless of  protec-
              tion status.

          AutoScalingGroupArn -> (string)
              A  generated  unique  ID  for the EC2 Auto Scaling group that is
              associated with this game server group.

          Status -> (string)
              The current status of the game server group.  Possible  statuses
              include:

              o NEW  -  GameLift  FleetIQ  has validated the CreateGameServer-
                Group() request.

              o ACTIVATING - GameLift FleetIQ is  setting  up  a  game  server
                group,  which  includes creating an Auto Scaling group in your
                AWS account.

              o ACTIVE - The game server group has been successfully  created.

              o DELETE_SCHEDULED  -  A request to delete the game server group
                has been received.

              o DELETING - GameLift FleetIQ has received a  valid  DeleteGame-
                ServerGroup()  request  and is processing it. GameLift FleetIQ
                must first complete and release hosts before  it  deletes  the
                Auto Scaling group and the game server group.

              o DELETED - The game server group has been successfully deleted.

              o ERROR - The asynchronous processes of activating or deleting a

          StatusReason -> (string)
              Additional  information about the current game server group sta-
              tus. This information might provide additional insight on groups
              that are in ERROR status.

          SuspendedActions -> (list)
              A  list of activities that are currently suspended for this game
              server group. If this property  is  empty,  all  activities  are
              occurring.

              (string)

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A  time stamp indicating when this data object was created. For-
              mat is a number expressed in  Unix  time  as  milliseconds  (for
              example "1469498468.057" ).

          LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
              A  timestamp that indicates when this game server group was last
              updated.
