UPDATE-FLEET-PORT-SETTINGS()                      UPDATE-FLEET-PORT-SETTINGS()



NAME
       update-fleet-port-settings -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  permissions that allow inbound traffic to connect to game ses-
       sions that are being hosted on instances in the fleet.

       To update settings, specify the fleet ID to be updated and specify  the
       changes to be made. List the permissions you want to add in InboundPer-
       missionAuthorizations , and permissions you want to remove in  Inbound-
       PermissionRevocations  .  Permissions to be removed must match existing
       fleet permissions.

       If successful, the fleet ID for the  updated  fleet  is  returned.  For
       fleets  with  remote  locations,  port setting updates can take time to
       propagate across all locations. You can check the status of updates  in
       each  location  by  calling  DescribeFleetPortSettings  with a location
       name.

SYNOPSIS
            update-fleet-port-settings
          --fleet-id <value>
          [--inbound-permission-authorizations <value>]
          [--inbound-permission-revocations <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet to update port settings  for.  You
          can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --inbound-permission-authorizations (list)
          A collection of port settings to be added to the fleet resource.

          (structure)
              A  range  of  IP  addresses and port settings that allow inbound
              traffic to connect to server  processes  on  an  instance  in  a
              fleet.  New game sessions are assigned an IP address/port number
              combination, which must fall into the  fleet's  allowed  ranges.
              Fleets  with custom game builds must have permissions explicitly
              set. For Realtime Servers fleets, GameLift  automatically  opens
              two port ranges, one for TCP messaging and one for UDP.

              FromPort -> (integer)
                 A starting value for a range of allowed port numbers.

              ToPort -> (integer)
                 An  ending  value  for  a range of allowed port numbers. Port
                 numbers are end-inclusive. This value  must  be  higher  than
                 FromPort .

              IpRange -> (string)
                 A range of allowed IP addresses. This value must be expressed
                 in CIDR notation. Example: "000.000.000.000/[subnet  mask]  "
                 or optionally the shortened version "0.0.0.0/[subnet mask] ".

              Protocol -> (string)
                 The network communication protocol used by the fleet.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FromPort=integer,ToPort=integer,IpRange=string,Protocol=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [

              "Protocol": "TCP"|"UDP"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --inbound-permission-revocations (list)
          A collection of port settings to be removed from the fleet resource.

          (structure)
              A  range  of  IP  addresses and port settings that allow inbound
              traffic to connect to server  processes  on  an  instance  in  a
              fleet.  New game sessions are assigned an IP address/port number

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FleetId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet that was updated.
