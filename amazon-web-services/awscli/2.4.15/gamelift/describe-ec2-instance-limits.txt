NAME
       describe-ec2-instance-limits -

DESCRIPTION
       The  GameLift  service limits and current utilization for an AWS Region
       or location. Instance limits  control  the  number  of  instances,  per
       instance  type, per location, that your AWS account can use. Learn more
       at Amazon EC2 Instance Types . The information  returned  includes  the
       maximum  number  of  instances allowed and your account's current usage
       across all fleets. This information can affect your  ability  to  scale
       your GameLift fleets. You can request a limit increase for your account
       by using the Service limits page in the GameLift console.

       Instance limits differ based on whether the instances are deployed in a
       fleet's home Region or in a remote location. For remote locations, lim-
       its also differ based on the combination  of  home  Region  and  remote
       location. All requests must specify an AWS Region (either explicitly or
       as your default settings). To get the limit for a remote location,  you
       must also specify the location. For example, the following requests all
       return different results:

       o Request specifies the Region ap-northeast-1  with  no  location.  The
         result  is  limits  and  usage  data  on  all instance types that are
         deployed in us-east-2 , by all of the fleets that reside in ap-north-
         east-1 .

       o Request  specifies  the Region us-east-1 with location ca-central-1 .
         The result is limits and usage data on all instance  types  that  are
         deployed  in  ca-central-1  ,  by  all  of  the fleets that reside in
         us-east-2 . These limits do not affect fleets in  any  other  Regions
         that deploy instances to ca-central-1 .

       o Request  specifies  the Region eu-west-1 with location ca-central-1 .
         The result is limits and usage data on all instance  types  that  are
         deployed  in  ca-central-1  ,  by  all  of  the fleets that reside in
         eu-west-1 .

       This operation can be used in the following ways:

       o To get limit and usage data for all instance types that are  deployed
         in  an  AWS  Region by fleets that reside in the same Region: Specify
         the Region only.  Optionally,  specify  a  single  instance  type  to
         retrieve information for.

       o To  get limit and usage data for all instance types that are deployed
         to a remote location by fleets that reside in different  AWS  Region:
         Provide  both  the  AWS  Region  and the remote location. Optionally,
         specify a single instance type to retrieve information for.

       If successful, an EC2InstanceLimits object is returned with limits  and
       usage data for each requested instance type.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-ec2-instance-limits
          [--ec2-instance-type <value>]
          [--location <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]

OPTIONS
       --ec2-instance-type (string)
          Name of an EC2 instance type that is supported in GameLift. A  fleet
          instance type determines the computing resources of each instance in
          the fleet, including CPU, memory, storage, and networking  capacity.
          Do not specify a value for this parameter to retrieve limits for all
          instance types.

       --location (string)
          The name of a remote location to request instance limits for, in the
          form of an AWS Region code such as us-west-2 .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve service limits for an EC2 instance type

       The following describe-ec2-instance-limits example displays the maximum
       allowed instances and current instances in use for  the  specified  EC2
       instance  type  in  the  current Region. The result indicates that only
       five of the allowed twenty instances are being used.

          aws gamelift describe-ec2-instance-limits \
              --ec2-instance-type m5.large

       Output:

          {
              "EC2InstanceLimits": [
                  {
                      "EC2InstanceType": ""m5.large",
                      "CurrentInstances": 5,
                      "InstanceLimit": 20
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       EC2InstanceLimits -> (list)
          The maximum number of instances for the specified instance type.

          (structure)
              The GameLift service limits for an EC2 instance type and current
              utilization. GameLift allows AWS accounts a  maximum  number  of
              instances,  per  instance  type, per AWS Region or location, for
              use with GameLift. You can request an limit  increase  for  your
              account  by  using  the Service limits page in the GameLift con-
              sole.
