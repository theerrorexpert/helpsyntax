STOP-MATCHMAKING()                                          STOP-MATCHMAKING()



NAME
       stop-matchmaking -

DESCRIPTION
       Cancels a matchmaking ticket or match backfill ticket that is currently
       being processed. To stop the matchmaking operation, specify the  ticket
       ID. If successful, work on the ticket is stopped, and the ticket status
       is changed to CANCELLED .

       This call is also used to turn off automatic backfill for an individual
       game  session. This is for game sessions that are created with a match-
       making configuration that has automatic backfill enabled. The ticket ID
       is  included  in  the MatchmakerData of an updated game session object,
       which is provided to the game server.

       NOTE:
              If the operation is successful, the service sends back an  empty
              JSON struct with the HTTP 200 response (not an empty HTTP body).

SYNOPSIS
            stop-matchmaking
          --ticket-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --ticket-id (string)
          A unique identifier for a matchmaking ticket.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
