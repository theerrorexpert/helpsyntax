NAME
       describe-build -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  properties  for  a  custom  game  build.  To request a build
       resource, specify a build ID. If successful, an object  containing  the
       build properties is returned.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-build
          --build-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --build-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the build to retrieve  properties  for.  You
          can use either the build ID or ARN value.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information on a custom game build

       The  following  describe-build  example retrieves properties for a game
       server build resource.

          aws gamelift describe-build \
              --build-id build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111

       Output:

          {
              "Build": {
                  "BuildArn": "arn:aws:gamelift:us-west-2::build/build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                  "BuildId": "build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                  "CreationTime": 1496708916.18,
                  "Name": "My_Game_Server_Build_One",
                  "OperatingSystem": "AMAZON_LINUX",
                  "SizeOnDisk": 1304924,
                  "Status": "READY",
                  "Version": "12345.678"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       Build -> (structure)
          Set of properties describing the requested build.

          BuildId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the build.

          BuildArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a GameLift
              build resource and  uniquely  identifies  it.  ARNs  are  unique
              across          all          Regions.          Format         is
              arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::build/build-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912
              .  In  a GameLift build ARN, the resource ID matches the BuildId
              value.

          Name -> (string)
              A descriptive label that is associated with a build. Build names
              do  not  need  to be unique. It can be set using  CreateBuild or
              UpdateBuild .

          Version -> (string)
              Version information that is associated with a build  or  script.
              Version  strings do not need to be unique. This value can be set
              using  CreateBuild or  UpdateBuild .

          Status -> (string)
              Current status of the build.

              Possible build statuses include the following:

              o INITIALIZED -- A new build has been defined, but no files have
                been uploaded. You cannot create fleets for builds that are in
                this status. When a build is successfully created,  the  build
                status is set to this value.

              o READY  --  The  game build has been successfully uploaded. You
                can now create new fleets for this build.

              o FAILED -- The game build upload failed. You cannot create  new
                fleets for this build.

          SizeOnDisk -> (long)
              File  size  of the uploaded game build, expressed in bytes. When
              the build status is INITIALIZED , this value is 0.

          OperatingSystem -> (string)
              Operating system that the game server binaries are built to  run
              on.  This  value determines the type of fleet resources that you
              can use for this build.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A time stamp indicating when this data object was created.  For-
              mat  is  a  number  expressed  in Unix time as milliseconds (for
              example "1469498468.057" ).
