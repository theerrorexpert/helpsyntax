SEARCH-GAME-SESSIONS()                                  SEARCH-GAME-SESSIONS()



NAME
       search-game-sessions -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  all active game sessions that match a set of search criteria
       and sorts them into a specified order.

       When searching for game sessions, you specify exactly where you want to
       search  and  provide  a search filter expression, a sort expression, or
       both. A search request can search only one fleet, but it can search all
       of a fleet's locations.

       This operation can be used in the following ways:

       o To  search  all game sessions that are currently running on all loca-
         tions in a fleet, provide a fleet or alias ID. This approach  returns
         game  sessions  in  the  fleet's home Region and all remote locations
         that fit the search criteria.

       o To search all game sessions that are currently running on a  specific
         fleet  location, provide a fleet or alias ID and a location name. For
         location, you can specify a fleet's home Region or any  remote  loca-
         tion.

       Use  the  pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequen-
       tial pages.

       If successful, a GameSession object is returned for each  game  session
       that matches the request. Search finds game sessions that are in ACTIVE
       status only. To retrieve information on game  sessions  in  other  sta-
       tuses, use  DescribeGameSessions .

       You can search or sort by the following game session attributes:

       o gameSessionId  --  A  unique identifier for the game session. You can
         use either a GameSessionId or GameSessionArn value.

       o gameSessionName -- Name assigned to a game session. This value is set
         when  requesting a new game session with  CreateGameSession or updat-
         ing with  UpdateGameSession . Game session names do not  need  to  be
         unique to a game session.

       o gameSessionProperties  --  Custom  data  defined  in a game session's
         GameProperty parameter. GameProperty values are stored  as  key:value
         pairs;  the  filter  expression must indicate the key and a string to
         search the data values for. For example, to search for game  sessions
         with  custom  data  containing  the  key:value pair "gameMode:brawl",
         specify the following: gameSessionProperties.gameMode = "brawl" . All
         custom data values are searched as strings.

       o maximumSessions  --  Maximum  number of player sessions allowed for a
         game session. This value is set when requesting a  new  game  session
         with  CreateGameSession or updating with  UpdateGameSession .

       o creationTimeMillis  --  Value indicating when a game session was cre-
         ated. It is expressed in Unix time as milliseconds.

       o playerSessionCount -- Number of players currently connected to a game
         session.  This  value  changes rapidly as players join the session or
         drop out.

       o hasAvailablePlayerSessions -- Boolean value indicating whether a game
         session  has reached its maximum number of players. It is highly rec-
         ommended that all search requests include this  filter  attribute  to
         optimize search performance and return only sessions that players can
         join.

       NOTE:
              Returned values for playerSessionCount and  hasAvailablePlayerS-
              essions  change quickly as players join sessions and others drop
              out. Results should be considered a snapshot in time. Be sure to
              refresh  search  results often, and handle sessions that fill up
              before a player can join.

       search-game-sessions is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: GameSessions

SYNOPSIS
            search-game-sessions
          [--fleet-id <value>]
          [--alias-id <value>]
          [--location <value>]
          [--filter-expression <value>]
          [--sort-expression <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for  the fleet to search for active game ses-
          sions. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN  value.  Each  request
          must reference either a fleet ID or alias ID, but not both.

       --alias-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for  the  alias  associated with the fleet to
          search for active game sessions. You can use either the alias ID  or
          ARN  value.  Each  request must reference either a fleet ID or alias
          ID, but not both.

       --location (string)
          A fleet location to search for game  sessions.  You  can  specify  a
          fleet's  home  Region  or a remote location. Use the AWS Region code
          format, such as us-west-2 .

       --filter-expression (string)
          String containing the search criteria for the session search. If  no
          filter  expression  is included, the request returns results for all
          game sessions in the fleet that are in ACTIVE status.

          A filter expression can contain one  or  multiple  conditions.  Each
          condition consists of the following:

          o Operand  --  Name  of  a  game session attribute. Valid values are
            gameSessionName , gameSessionId , gameSessionProperties , maximum-
            Sessions , creationTimeMillis , playerSessionCount , hasAvailable-
            PlayerSessions .

          o Comparator -- Valid comparators are: = , <> , < , > , <= , >= .

          o Value -- Value to be searched for. Values may be numbers,  boolean
            values  (true/false)  or  strings depending on the operand. String
            values are case sensitive and must be enclosed in  single  quotes.
            Special  characters must be escaped. Boolean and string values can
            only be used with the comparators = and <> . For example, the fol-
            lowing  filter expression searches on gameSessionName : "FilterEx-
            pression": "gameSessionName = 'Matt\\'s Awesome Game 1'" .

          To chain multiple conditions in a single expression, use the logical
          keywords  AND , OR , and NOT and parentheses as needed. For example:
          x AND y AND NOT z , NOT (x OR y) .

          Session search evaluates conditions from left  to  right  using  the
          following precedence rules:

          o = , <> , < , > , <= , >=

          o Parentheses

          o NOT

          o AND

          o OR

          For  example, this filter expression retrieves game sessions hosting
          at least ten players that have an  open  player  slot:  "maximumSes-
          sions>=10 AND hasAvailablePlayerSessions=true" .

       --sort-expression (string)
          Instructions  on  how to sort the search results. If no sort expres-
          sion is included, the request returns results  in  random  order.  A
          sort expression consists of the following elements:

          o Operand  --  Name  of  a  game session attribute. Valid values are
            gameSessionName , gameSessionId , gameSessionProperties , maximum-
            Sessions , creationTimeMillis , playerSessionCount , hasAvailable-
            PlayerSessions .

          o Order -- Valid sort orders are ASC (ascending) and DESC  (descend-
            ing).

          For example, this sort expression returns the oldest active sessions
          first: "SortExpression": "creationTimeMillis ASC" . Results  with  a
          null value for the sort operand are returned at the end of the list.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GameSessions -> (list)
          A  collection of objects containing game session properties for each
          session that matches the request.

          (structure)
              Properties describing a game session.

              A game session in ACTIVE status can host players.  When  a  game
              session ends, its status is set to TERMINATED .

              Once  the  session ends, the game session object is retained for
              30 days. This means you can reuse idempotency token values after
              this time. Game session logs are retained for 14 days.

              GameSessionId -> (string)
                 A  unique identifier for the game session. A game session ARN
                 has the following format: arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::gameses-
                 sion/<fleet ID>/<custom ID string or idempotency token> .

              Name -> (string)
                 A  descriptive  label that is associated with a game session.
                 Session names do not need to be unique.

              FleetId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the fleet that the  game  session  is
                 running on.

              FleetArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) associated with the GameLift
                 fleet that this game session is running on.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A time stamp indicating when this data  object  was  created.
                 Format  is  a  number  expressed in Unix time as milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              TerminationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A time stamp indicating when this data object was terminated.
                 Format  is  a  number  expressed in Unix time as milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              CurrentPlayerSessionCount -> (integer)
                 Number of players currently in the game session.

              MaximumPlayerSessionCount -> (integer)
                 The maximum number of players that can be connected  simulta-
                 neously to the game session.

              Status -> (string)
                 Current  status of the game session. A game session must have
                 an ACTIVE status to have player sessions.

              StatusReason -> (string)
                 Provides additional information about  game  session  status.
                 INTERRUPTED  indicates  that the game session was hosted on a
                 spot instance that was reclaimed,  causing  the  active  game
                 session to be terminated.

              GameProperties -> (list)
                 A  set  of custom properties for a game session, formatted as
                 key:value pairs. These properties are passed to a game server
                 process  in the  GameSession object with a request to start a
                 new game session. You can search  for  active  game  sessions
                 based on this custom data with  SearchGameSessions .

                 (structure)
                     Set  of  key-value pairs that contain information about a
                     game session. When included in a  game  session  request,
                     these properties communicate details to be used when set-
                     ting up the new game session. For example, a  game  prop-
                     erty might specify a game mode, level, or map. Game prop-
                     erties are passed to the game server process when  initi-
                     ating  a  new game session. For more information, see the
                     GameLift Developer Guide .

                     Key -> (string)
                        The game property identifier.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The game property value.

              IpAddress -> (string)
                 The IP address of the game session. To connect to a  GameLift
                 game  server,  an app needs both the IP address and port num-
                 ber.

              DnsName -> (string)
                 The DNS identifier assigned to the instance that  is  running
                 the game session. Values have the following format:

                 o TLS-enabled  fleets:  <unique  identifier>.<region  identi-
                   fier>.amazongamelift.com .

                 o Non-TLS-enabled   fleets:   ec2-<unique    identifier>.com-
                   pute.amazonaws.com . (See Amazon EC2 Instance IP Addressing
                   .)

                 When connecting to a  game  session  that  is  running  on  a
                 TLS-enabled  fleet,  you  must  use  the DNS name, not the IP
                 address.

              Port -> (integer)
                 The port number  for  the  game  session.  To  connect  to  a
                 GameLift  game  server,  an app needs both the IP address and
                 port number.

              PlayerSessionCreationPolicy -> (string)
                 Indicates whether or not the game session  is  accepting  new
                 players.

              CreatorId -> (string)
                 A  unique identifier for a player. This ID is used to enforce
                 a resource protection policy (if one exists), that limits the
                 number of game sessions a player can create.

              GameSessionData -> (string)
                 A  set of custom game session properties, formatted as a sin-
                 gle string value. This  data  is  passed  to  a  game  server
                 process  in the  GameSession object with a request to start a
                 new game session.

              MatchmakerData -> (string)
                 Information about the matchmaking process that  was  used  to
                 create the game session. It is in JSON syntax, formatted as a
                 string. In addition the matchmaking  configuration  used,  it
                 contains data on all players assigned to the match, including
                 player attributes and team assignments. For more  details  on
                 matchmaker  data,  see Match Data . Matchmaker data is useful
                 when requesting match backfills, and is updated whenever  new
                 players  are  added during a successful backfill (see  Start-
                 MatchBackfill ).

              Location -> (string)
                 The fleet location where the game session  is  running.  This
                 value might specify the fleet's home Region or a remote loca-
                 tion. Location is expressed as an AWS  Region  code  such  as
                 us-west-2 .

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  that  indicates  where to resume retrieving results on the
          next call to this operation. If no token is returned, these  results
          represent the end of the list.
