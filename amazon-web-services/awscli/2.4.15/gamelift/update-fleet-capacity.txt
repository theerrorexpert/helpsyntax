UPDATE-FLEET-CAPACITY()                                UPDATE-FLEET-CAPACITY()



NAME
       update-fleet-capacity -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  capacity  settings for a fleet. For fleets with multiple loca-
       tions, use this operation to manage capacity settings in each  location
       individually. Fleet capacity determines the number of game sessions and
       players that can be hosted based on the fleet configuration.  Use  this
       operation to set the following fleet capacity properties:

       o Minimum/maximum  size:  Set  hard  limits on fleet capacity. GameLift
         cannot set the fleet's capacity to a value  outside  of  this  range,
         whether  the  capacity is changed manually or through automatic scal-
         ing.

       o Desired capacity: Manually set the number  of  EC2  instances  to  be
         maintained  in  a  fleet  location. Before changing a fleet's desired
         capacity, you may want to call  DescribeEC2InstanceLimits to get  the
         maximum  capacity  of  the  fleet's EC2 instance type. Alternatively,
         consider using automatic scaling to adjust capacity based  on  player
         demand.

       This operation can be used in the following ways:

       o To  update capacity for a fleet's home Region, or if the fleet has no
         remote locations, omit the Location parameter. The fleet must  be  in
         ACTIVE status.

       o To  update  capacity for a fleet's remote location, include the Loca-
         tion parameter set to the location to be updated. The  location  must
         be in ACTIVE status.

       If successful, capacity settings are updated immediately. In response a
       change in desired capacity,  GameLift  initiates  steps  to  start  new
       instances  or terminate existing instances in the requested fleet loca-
       tion. This continues until the location's active instance count matches
       the  new desired instance count. You can track a fleet's current capac-
       ity by calling  DescribeFleetCapacity or  DescribeFleetLocationCapacity
       .  If  the requested desired instance count is higher than the instance
       type's limit, the LimitExceeded exception occurs.

SYNOPSIS
            update-fleet-capacity
          --fleet-id <value>
          [--desired-instances <value>]
          [--min-size <value>]
          [--max-size <value>]
          [--location <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet to update capacity  settings  for.
          You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --desired-instances (integer)
          The  number  of  EC2 instances you want to maintain in the specified
          fleet location. This value must fall between the minimum and maximum
          size limits.

       --min-size (integer)
          The  minimum  number  of instances that are allowed in the specified
          fleet location. If this parameter is not set, the default is 0.

       --max-size (integer)
          The maximum number of instances that are allowed  in  the  specified
          fleet location. If this parameter is not set, the default is 1.

       --location (string)
          The name of a remote location to update fleet capacity settings for,
          in the form of an AWS Region code such as us-west-2 .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FleetId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet that was updated.

       FleetArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a GameLift fleet
          resource  and  uniquely  identifies  it.  ARNs are unique across all
          Regions.                          Format                          is
          arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912
          .

       Location -> (string)
          The remote location being updated, expressed as an AWS Region  code,
          such as us-west-2 .
