DESCRIBE-FLEET-PORT-SETTINGS()                  DESCRIBE-FLEET-PORT-SETTINGS()



NAME
       describe-fleet-port-settings -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a fleet's inbound connection permissions. Connection permis-
       sions specify the range of IP addresses and port settings that incoming
       traffic  can use to access server processes in the fleet. Game sessions
       that are running on instances in the fleet must  use  connections  that
       fall in this range.

       This operation can be used in the following ways:

       o To  retrieve the inbound connection permissions for a fleet, identify
         the fleet's unique identifier.

       o To check the status of recent updates to  a  fleet  remote  location,
         specify  the  fleet  ID and a location. Port setting updates can take
         time to propagate across all locations.

       If successful, a set of   IpPermission  objects  is  returned  for  the
       requested  fleet  ID. When a location is specified, a pending status is
       included. If the requested fleet has been deleted, the  result  set  is
       empty.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-fleet-port-settings
          --fleet-id <value>
          [--location <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet to retrieve port settings for. You
          can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --location (string)
          A remote location to check for status of port setting  updates.  Use
          the AWS Region code format, such as us-west-2 .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To view inbound connection permissions for a fleet

       The following describe-fleet-port-settings example retrieves connection
       settings for a specified fleet.

          aws gamelift describe-fleet-port-settings \
              --fleet-id arn:aws:gamelift:us-west-2::fleet/fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111

       Output:

          {
              "InboundPermissions": [
                  {
                      "FromPort": 33400,
                      "ToPort": 33500,
                      "IpRange": "0.0.0.0/0",
                      "Protocol": "UDP"
                  },
                  {
                      "FromPort": 1900,
                      "ToPort": 2000,
                      "IpRange": "0.0.0.0/0",
                      "Protocol": "TCP"
                  }
              ]
          }

       GameLift Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       FleetId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet that was requested.

       FleetArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a GameLift fleet
          resource and uniquely identifies it.  ARNs  are  unique  across  all
          Regions.                          Format                          is
          arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912
          .

       InboundPermissions -> (list)
          The port settings for the requested fleet ID.

          (structure)
              A  range  of  IP  addresses and port settings that allow inbound
              traffic to connect to server  processes  on  an  instance  in  a
              fleet.  New game sessions are assigned an IP address/port number
              combination, which must fall into the  fleet's  allowed  ranges.
              Fleets  with custom game builds must have permissions explicitly
              set. For Realtime Servers fleets, GameLift  automatically  opens
              two port ranges, one for TCP messaging and one for UDP.

              FromPort -> (integer)
                 A starting value for a range of allowed port numbers.

              ToPort -> (integer)
                 An  ending  value  for  a range of allowed port numbers. Port
                 numbers are end-inclusive. This value  must  be  higher  than
                 FromPort .

              IpRange -> (string)
                 A range of allowed IP addresses. This value must be expressed
                 in CIDR notation. Example: "000.000.000.000/[subnet  mask]  "
                 or optionally the shortened version "0.0.0.0/[subnet mask] ".

              Protocol -> (string)
                 The network communication protocol used by the fleet.

       UpdateStatus -> (string)
          The current status of updates to the fleet's port  settings  in  the
          requested  fleet location. A status of PENDING_UPDATE indicates that
          an update was requested for the fleet but has not yet been completed
          for the location.

       Location -> (string)
          The  requested fleet location, expressed as an AWS Region code, such
          as us-west-2 .
