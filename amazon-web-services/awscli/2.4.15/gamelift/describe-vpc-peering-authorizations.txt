SYNOPSIS
            describe-vpc-peering-authorizations
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       VpcPeeringAuthorizations -> (list)
          A  collection  of objects that describe all valid VPC peering opera-
          tions for the current AWS account.

          (structure)
              Represents an authorization for a VPC peering connection between
              the  VPC  for  an  Amazon  GameLift  fleet and another VPC on an
              account you have access to. This authorization must exist and be
              valid  for  the peering connection to be established. Authoriza-
              tions are valid for 24 hours after they are issued.

              GameLiftAwsAccountId -> (string)
                 A  unique identifier for the AWS account that you use to man-
                 age your GameLift fleet. You can find your Account ID in  the
                 AWS Management Console under account settings.

              PeerVpcAwsAccountId -> (string)

              PeerVpcId -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier for a VPC with resources to be accessed
                 by your GameLift fleet. The VPC must be in the same Region as
                 your fleet. To look up a VPC ID, use the VPC Dashboard in the
                 AWS Management Console. Learn more about VPC peering  in  VPC
                 Peering with GameLift Fleets .

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 Time  stamp  indicating  when  this authorization was issued.
                 Format is a number expressed in  Unix  time  as  milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              ExpirationTime -> (timestamp)
                 Time  stamp  indicating  when  this authorization expires (24
                 hours after issuance). Format is a number expressed  in  Unix
                 time as milliseconds (for example "1469498468.057" ).
