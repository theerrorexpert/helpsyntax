GET-INSTANCE-ACCESS()                                    GET-INSTANCE-ACCESS()



NAME
       get-instance-access -

DESCRIPTION
       Requests remote access to a fleet instance. Remote access is useful for
       debugging, gathering benchmarking data, or observing activity  in  real
       time.

       To  remotely  access  an  instance, you need credentials that match the
       operating system of the instance.  For  a  Windows  instance,  GameLift
       returns  a  user  name  and  password as strings for use with a Windows
       Remote Desktop client. For a Linux instance, GameLift  returns  a  user
       name  and RSA private key, also as strings, for use with an SSH client.
       The private key must be saved in the  proper  format  to  a  .pem  file
       before  using.  If you're making this request using the AWS CLI, saving
       the secret can be handled as part of the GetInstanceAccess request,  as
       shown in one of the examples for this operation.

       To  request  access to a specific instance, specify the IDs of both the
       instance and the fleet it  belongs  to.  You  can  retrieve  a  fleet's
       instance   IDs  by  calling   DescribeInstances  .  If  successful,  an
       InstanceAccess object is  returned  that  contains  the  instance's  IP
       address and a set of credentials.

SYNOPSIS
            get-instance-access
          --fleet-id <value>
          --instance-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet that  contains  the  instance  you
          want  access  to.  You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value. The
          fleet can be in any of the following statuses: ACTIVATING , ACTIVE ,
          or ERROR . Fleets with an ERROR status may be accessible for a short
          time before they are deleted.

       --instance-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the instance you want to get access to.  You
          can access an instance in any status.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       InstanceAccess -> (structure)
          The  connection  information  for  a  fleet  instance,  including IP
          address and access credentials.

          FleetId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the fleet containing the instance  being
              accessed.

          InstanceId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the instance being accessed.

          IpAddress -> (string)
              IP address that is assigned to the instance.

          OperatingSystem -> (string)
              Operating system that is running on the instance.

          Credentials -> (structure)
              Credentials required to access the instance.

              UserName -> (string)
                 User login string.

              Secret -> (string)
                 Secret  string.  For Windows instances, the secret is a pass-
                 word  for  use  with  Windows  Remote  Desktop.   For   Linux
                 instances, it is a private key (which must be saved as a .pem
                 file) for use with SSH.
