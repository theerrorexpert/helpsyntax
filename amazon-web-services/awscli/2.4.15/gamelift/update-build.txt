NAME
       update-build -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates metadata in a build resource, including the build name and ver-
       sion. To update the metadata, specify the build ID to update  and  pro-
       vide  the  new  values.  If  successful,  a build object containing the
       updated metadata is returned.

SYNOPSIS
            update-build
          --build-id <value>
          [--name <value>]
          [--build-version <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --build-id (string)
          A  unique identifier for the build to update. You can use either the
          build ID or ARN value.

       --name (string)
          A descriptive label that is associated with a build. Build names  do
          not need to be unique.

       --build-version (string)
          Version  information that is associated with a build or script. Ver-
          sion strings do not need to be unique.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update a custom game build

       The following update-build example changes the name and version  infor-
       mation that is associated with a specified build resource. The returned
       build object verifies that the changes were made successfully.

          aws gamelift update-build \
              --build-id build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111 \
              --name MegaFrogRaceServer.NA.east \
              --build-version 12345.east

       Output:

          {
              "Build": {
                  "BuildArn": "arn:aws:gamelift:us-west-2::build/build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                  "BuildId": "build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                  "CreationTime": 1496708916.18,
                  "Name": "MegaFrogRaceServer.NA.east",
                  "OperatingSystem": "AMAZON_LINUX_2",
                  "SizeOnDisk": 1304924,
                  "Status": "READY",
                  "Version": "12345.east"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       Build -> (structure)
          The updated build resource.

          BuildId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the build.

          BuildArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a GameLift
              build resource and  uniquely  identifies  it.  ARNs  are  unique
              across          all          Regions.          Format         is
              arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::build/build-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912
              .  In  a GameLift build ARN, the resource ID matches the BuildId
              value.

          Name -> (string)
              A descriptive label that is associated with a build. Build names
              do  not  need  to be unique. It can be set using  CreateBuild or
              UpdateBuild .

          Version -> (string)
              Version information that is associated with a build  or  script.
              Version  strings do not need to be unique. This value can be set
              using  CreateBuild or  UpdateBuild .

          Status -> (string)
              Current status of the build.

              Possible build statuses include the following:

              o INITIALIZED -- A new build has been defined, but no files have
                been uploaded. You cannot create fleets for builds that are in
                this status. When a build is successfully created,  the  build
                status is set to this value.

              o READY  --  The  game build has been successfully uploaded. You
                can now create new fleets for this build.

              o FAILED -- The game build upload failed. You cannot create  new
                fleets for this build.

          SizeOnDisk -> (long)
              File  size  of the uploaded game build, expressed in bytes. When
              the build status is INITIALIZED , this value is 0.

          OperatingSystem -> (string)
              Operating system that the game server binaries are built to  run
              on.  This  value determines the type of fleet resources that you
              can use for this build.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A time stamp indicating when this data object was created.  For-
              mat  is  a  number  expressed  in Unix time as milliseconds (for
              example "1469498468.057" ).
