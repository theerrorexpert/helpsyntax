       describe-matchmaking-configurations  is a paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: Configurations

SYNOPSIS
            describe-matchmaking-configurations
          [--names <value>]
          [--rule-set-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --names (list)
          A  unique  identifier  for  the  matchmaking   configuration(s)   to
          retrieve. You can use either the configuration name or ARN value. To
          request all existing configurations, leave this parameter empty.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --rule-set-name (string)
          A unique identifier for the matchmaking rule set. You can use either
          the  rule  set name or ARN value. Use this parameter to retrieve all
          matchmaking configurations that use this rule set.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Configurations -> (list)
          A collection of requested matchmaking configurations.

          (structure)
              Guidelines  for  use with FlexMatch to match players into games.
              All matchmaking requests must specify a  matchmaking  configura-
              tion.

              Name -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier for the matchmaking configuration. This
                 name is used to identify the configuration associated with  a
                 matchmaking request or ticket.

              ConfigurationArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN  )  that  is  assigned to a
                 GameLift  matchmaking  configuration  resource  and  uniquely
                 identifies  it. ARNs are unique across all Regions. Format is
                 arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::matchmakingconfiguration/<match-
                 making configuration name> . In a GameLift configuration ARN,
                 the resource ID matches the Name value.

              Description -> (string)
                 A descriptive label that is associated with matchmaking  con-
                 figuration.

              GameSessionQueueArns -> (list)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN  )  that  is  assigned to a
                 GameLift game session queue resource and uniquely  identifies
                 it.   ARNs   are   unique   across  all  Regions.  Format  is
                 arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::gamesessionqueue/<queue  name>   .
                 Queues can be located in any Region. Queues are used to start
                 new GameLift-hosted game sessions for matches that  are  cre-
                 ated  with  this  matchmaking configuration. This property is
                 not set when FlexMatchMode is set to STANDALONE .

                 (string)

              RequestTimeoutSeconds -> (integer)
                 The maximum duration, in seconds, that a  matchmaking  ticket
                 can  remain  in process before timing out. Requests that fail
                 due to timing out can be resubmitted as needed.

              AcceptanceTimeoutSeconds -> (integer)
                 The length of time (in seconds) to wait for players to accept
                 a  proposed  match,  if acceptance is required. If any player
                 rejects the match or fails to accept before the timeout,  the
                 ticket continues to look for an acceptable match.

              AcceptanceRequired -> (boolean)
                 A  flag  that indicates whether a match that was created with
                 this configuration must be accepted by the  matched  players.
                 To  require  acceptance,  set  to  TRUE.  When this option is
                 enabled, matchmaking tickets use the  status  REQUIRES_ACCEP-
                 TANCE to indicate when a completed potential match is waiting
                 for player acceptance.

              RuleSetName -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the matchmaking rule set to use  with
                 this  configuration. A matchmaking configuration can only use
                 rule sets that are defined in the same Region.

              RuleSetArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) associated with the  GameLift
                 matchmaking rule set resource that this configuration uses.

              NotificationTarget -> (string)
                 An  SNS topic ARN that is set up to receive matchmaking noti-
                 fications.

              AdditionalPlayerCount -> (integer)
                 The number of player slots in a match to keep open for future
                 players.  For example, if the configuration's rule set speci-
                 fies a match for a single 12-person team, and the  additional
                 player  count  is  set to 2, only 10 players are selected for
                 the match. This parameter is not used when  FlexMatchMode  is
                 set to STANDALONE .

              CustomEventData -> (string)
                 Information  to attach to all events related to the matchmak-
                 ing configuration.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A time stamp indicating when this data  object  was  created.
                 Format  is  a  number  expressed in Unix time as milliseconds
                 (for example "1469498468.057" ).

              GameProperties -> (list)
                 A set of custom properties for a game session,  formatted  as
                 key:value pairs. These properties are passed to a game server
                 process in the  GameSession object with a request to start  a
                 new  game  session (see Start a Game Session ). This informa-
                 tion is added to the new  GameSession object that is  created
                 for a successful match. This parameter is not used when Flex-
                 MatchMode is set to STANDALONE .

                 (structure)
                     Set of key-value pairs that contain information  about  a
                     game  session.  When  included in a game session request,
                     these properties communicate details to be used when set-
                     ting  up  the new game session. For example, a game prop-
                     erty might specify a game mode, level, or map. Game prop-
                     erties  are passed to the game server process when initi-
                     ating a new game session. For more information,  see  the
                     GameLift Developer Guide .

                     Key -> (string)
                        The game property identifier.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The game property value.

              GameSessionData -> (string)
                 A  set of custom game session properties, formatted as a sin-
                 gle string value. This  data  is  passed  to  a  game  server
                 process  in the  GameSession object with a request to start a
                 new game session (see Start a Game Session ).  This  informa-
                 tion  is added to the new  GameSession object that is created
                 for a successful match. This parameter is not used when Flex-
                 MatchMode is set to STANDALONE .

              BackfillMode -> (string)
                 The  method  used to backfill game sessions created with this
                 matchmaking configuration. MANUAL  indicates  that  the  game
                 makes  backfill  requests  or does not use the match backfill
                 feature. AUTOMATIC indicates that  GameLift  creates   Start-
                 MatchBackfill  requests  whenever  a  game session has one or
                 more open slots. Learn more about manual and automatic  back-
                 fill  in  Backfill  existing games with FlexMatch . Automatic
                 backfill is not available when FlexMatchMode is set to STAND-
                 ALONE .

              FlexMatchMode -> (string)
                 Indicates  whether  this  matchmaking  configuration is being
                 used with GameLift hosting or  as  a  standalone  matchmaking
                 solution.

                 o STANDALONE  -  FlexMatch  forms  matches  and returns match
                   information, including players and team assignments,  in  a
                   MatchmakingSucceeded event.

                 o WITH_QUEUE - FlexMatch forms matches and uses the specified
                   GameLift queue to start a game session for the match.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates where to resume  retrieving  results  on  the
          next  call to this operation. If no token is returned, these results
          represent the end of the list.
