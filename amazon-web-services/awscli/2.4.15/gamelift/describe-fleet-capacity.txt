DESCRIBE-FLEET-CAPACITY()                            DESCRIBE-FLEET-CAPACITY()



NAME
       describe-fleet-capacity -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  resource  capacity settings for one or more fleets. The
       data returned includes  the  current  fleet  capacity  (number  of  EC2
       instances),  and  settings  that  can control how capacity scaling. For
       fleets with remote locations, this operation  retrieves  data  for  the
       fleet's  home  Region  only.  See  DescribeFleetLocationCapacity to get
       capacity settings for a fleet's remote locations.

       This operation can be used in the following ways:

       o To get capacity data for one or more specific fleets, provide a  list
         of fleet IDs or fleet ARNs.

       o To  get  capacity data for all fleets, do not provide a fleet identi-
         fier.

       When requesting multiple  fleets,  use  the  pagination  parameters  to
       retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.

       If  successful,  a  FleetCapacity object is returned for each requested
       fleet ID. Each FleetCapacity object includes a Location property, which
       is  set  to  the  fleet's home Region. When a list of fleet IDs is pro-
       vided, attribute objects are returned only for  fleets  that  currently
       exist.

       NOTE:
              Some  API  operations may limit the number of fleet IDs that are
              allowed in one request. If a request  exceeds  this  limit,  the
              request  fails  and  the  error  message  includes  the  maximum
              allowed.

       describe-fleet-capacity is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: FleetCapacity

SYNOPSIS
            describe-fleet-capacity
          [--fleet-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-ids (list)
          A  unique  identifier for the fleet(s) to retrieve capacity informa-
          tion for. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.  Leave  this
          parameter empty to retrieve capacity information for all fleets.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FleetCapacity -> (list)
          A collection of objects that contains capacity information for  each
          requested  fleet  ID.  Capacity objects are returned only for fleets
          that currently exist.

          (structure)
              Current resource capacity settings in a specified fleet or loca-
              tion.  The  location value might refer to a fleet's remote loca-
              tion or its home Region.

              FleetId -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier for the fleet associated with the loca-
                 tion.

              FleetArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN  )  that  is  assigned  to  a
                 GameLift  fleet resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are
                 unique      across      all      Regions.      Format      is
                 arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912
                 .

              InstanceType -> (string)
                 The EC2 instance type that is used for  all  instances  in  a
                 fleet.  The  instance type determines the computing resources
                 in use, including CPU, memory, storage, and networking capac-
                 ity. See Amazon EC2 Instance Types for detailed descriptions.

                 The current instance count  and  capacity  settings  for  the
                 fleet location.

                 DESIRED -> (integer)
                     Ideal  number  of  active instances. GameLift will always
                     try to maintain the desired number of instances. Capacity
                     is scaled up or down by changing the desired instances.

                 MINIMUM -> (integer)
                     The minimum instance count value allowed.

                 MAXIMUM -> (integer)
                     The maximum instance count value allowed.

                 PENDING -> (integer)
                     Number of instances that are starting but not yet active.

                 ACTIVE -> (integer)
                     Actual number of instances that are ready  to  host  game
                     sessions.

                 IDLE -> (integer)
                     Number of active instances that are not currently hosting
                     a game session.

                 TERMINATING -> (integer)
                     Number of instances that are no longer active but haven't
                     yet been terminated.

              Location -> (string)
                 The  fleet  location  for  the  instance  count  information,
                 expressed as an AWS Region code, such as us-west-2 .

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates where to resume  retrieving  results  on  the
          next  call to this operation. If no token is returned, these results
          represent the end of the list.
