NAME
       describe-game-session-details -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  additional  game session properties, including the game ses-
       sion protection policy in force, a set of one or more game sessions  in
       a  specific  fleet  location.  You can optionally filter the results by
       current game session status. Alternatively, use  SearchGameSessions  to
       request a set of active game sessions that are filtered by certain cri-
       teria. To retrieve all game session properties,  use   DescribeGameSes-
       sions .

       This operation can be used in the following ways:

       o To  retrieve details for all game sessions that are currently running
         on all locations in a fleet, provide a fleet or  alias  ID,  with  an
         optional  status  filter.  This  approach  returns  details  from the
         fleet's home Region and all remote locations.

       o To retrieve details for all game sessions that are currently  running
         on a specific fleet location, provide a fleet or alias ID and a loca-
         tion name, with optional status  filter.  The  location  can  be  the
         fleet's home Region or any remote location.

       o To  retrieve  details  for  a specific game session, provide the game
         session ID. This approach looks for the game session ID in all fleets
         that reside in the AWS Region defined in the request.

       Use  the  pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequen-
       tial pages.

       If successful, a GameSessionDetail object is  returned  for  each  game
       session that matches the request.

       describe-game-session-details  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: GameSessionDetails

SYNOPSIS
            describe-game-session-details
          [--fleet-id <value>]
          [--game-session-id <value>]
          [--alias-id <value>]
          [--location <value>]
          [--status-filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fleet-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the fleet  to  retrieve  all  game  sessions
          active on the fleet. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.

       --game-session-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the game session to retrieve.

       --alias-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for  the  alias  associated with the fleet to
          retrieve all game sessions for. You can use either the alias  ID  or
          ARN value.

       --location (string)
          A fleet location to get game sessions for. You can specify a fleet's
          home Region or a remote location. Use the AWS  Region  code  format,
          such as us-west-2 .

       --status-filter (string)
          Game session status to filter results on. Possible game session sta-
          tuses include ACTIVE , TERMINATED , ACTIVATING and TERMINATING  (the
          last two are transitory).

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GameSessionDetails -> (list)
          A collection of properties for each game session  that  matches  the

                     A unique identifier for the game session. A game  session
                     ARN        has        the        following        format:
                     arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::gamesession/<fleet ID>/<custom
                     ID string or idempotency token> .

                 Name -> (string)
                     A  descriptive  label that is associated with a game ses-
                     sion. Session names do not need to be unique.

                 FleetId -> (string)
                     A unique identifier for the fleet that the  game  session
                     is running on.

                 FleetArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN  )  associated with the

                     liseconds (for example "1469498468.057" ).

                 TerminationTime -> (timestamp)
                     A time stamp indicating when this data object was  termi-
                     nated.  Format is a number expressed in Unix time as mil-
                     liseconds (for example "1469498468.057" ).

                 CurrentPlayerSessionCount -> (integer)
                     Number of players currently in the game session.

                 MaximumPlayerSessionCount -> (integer)
                     The maximum number  of  players  that  can  be  connected
                     simultaneously to the game session.

                 Status -> (string)
                     Current  status  of the game session. A game session must
                     have an ACTIVE status to have player sessions.

                 StatusReason -> (string)
                     Provides additional information about game  session  sta-
                     tus.  INTERRUPTED  indicates  that  the  game session was
                     hosted on a spot instance that was reclaimed, causing the
                     active game session to be terminated.

                 GameProperties -> (list)
                     A  set of custom properties for a game session, formatted
                     as key:value pairs. These properties are passed to a game
                     server  process in the  GameSession object with a request
                     to start a new game session. You can  search  for  active
                     game sessions based on this custom data with  SearchGame-
                     Sessions .

                     (structure)
                        Set of key-value pairs that contain information  about
                        a  game  session.  When  included  in  a  game session
                        request, these properties communicate  details  to  be
                        used  when  setting up the new game session. For exam-
                        ple, a game property might specify a game mode, level,
                        or  map. Game properties are passed to the game server
                        process when initiating a new game session.  For  more
                        information, see the GameLift Developer Guide .

                        Key -> (string)
                            The game property identifier.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The game property value.

                 IpAddress -> (string)
                     The  IP  address  of  the  game  session. To connect to a
                     GameLift game server, an app needs both  the  IP  address
                     and port number.

                 DnsName -> (string)
                     The  DNS identifier assigned to the instance that is run-
                     ning the game session. Values have the following format:

                     o TLS-enabled fleets: <unique identifier>.<region identi-
                       fier>.amazongamelift.com .

                     o Non-TLS-enabled  fleets:  ec2-<unique  identifier>.com-
                       pute.amazonaws.com  .  (See  Amazon  EC2  Instance   IP
                       Addressing .)

                     When  connecting  to  a game session that is running on a
                     TLS-enabled fleet, you must use the DNS name, not the  IP
                     address.

                 Port -> (integer)
                     The  port  number  for  the game session. To connect to a
                     GameLift game server, an app needs both  the  IP  address
                     and port number.

                 PlayerSessionCreationPolicy -> (string)
                     Indicates  whether  or  not the game session is accepting
                     new players.

                 CreatorId -> (string)
                     A unique identifier for a player.  This  ID  is  used  to
                     enforce  a  resource  protection  policy (if one exists),
                     that limits the number of game sessions a player can cre-
                     ate.

                 GameSessionData -> (string)
                     A  set  of custom game session properties, formatted as a
                     single string value. This data is passed to a game server
                     process  in  the   GameSession  object  with a request to
                     start a new game session.

                 MatchmakerData -> (string)
                     Information about the matchmaking process that  was  used
                     to create the game session. It is in JSON syntax, format-
                     ted as a string. In addition the  matchmaking  configura-
                     tion  used,  it  contains data on all players assigned to
                     the match, including player attributes and  team  assign-
                     ments.  For  more  details  on matchmaker data, see Match
                     Data . Matchmaker data is useful  when  requesting  match
                     backfills,  and is updated whenever new players are added
                     during a successful backfill (see  StartMatchBackfill  ).

                 Location -> (string)
                     The  fleet  location  where  the game session is running.
                     This value might specify the fleet's  home  Region  or  a
                     remote  location.  Location is expressed as an AWS Region
                     code such as us-west-2 .

              ProtectionPolicy -> (string)
                 Current status of protection for the game session.

                 o NoProtection -- The game session can be terminated during a
                   scale-down event.

                 o FullProtection  -- If the game session is in an ACTIVE sta-
                   tus, it cannot be terminated during a scale-down event.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates where to resume  retrieving  results  on  the
          next  call to this operation. If no token is returned, these results
          represent the end of the list.
