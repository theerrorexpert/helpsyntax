NAME
       get-game-session-log-url -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the location of stored game session logs for a specified game
       session. When a game  session  is  terminated,  GameLift  automatically
       stores the logs in Amazon S3 and retains them for 14 days. Use this URL
       to download the logs.

       NOTE:
              See the AWS Service Limits page for maximum log file sizes.  Log
              files that exceed this limit are not saved.

SYNOPSIS
            get-game-session-log-url
          --game-session-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --game-session-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the game session to get logs for.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PreSignedUrl -> (string)
          Location of the requested game session logs, available for download.
          This URL is valid for 15 minutes, after which  S3  will  reject  any
          download  request using this URL. You can request a new URL any time
          within the 14-day period that the logs are retained.
