DESCRIPTION

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-project
          [--name <value>]
          [--contents <value>]
          [--snapshot-id <value>]
          [--project-region <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          Name of the project.

       --contents (blob)
          ZIP  or  YAML  file which contains configuration settings to be used
          when creating the project. This may be  the  contents  of  the  file
          downloaded from the URL provided in an export project operation.

       --snapshot-id (string)
          Unique identifier for an exported snapshot of project configuration.
          This snapshot identifier is included in the share URL when a project
          is exported.

       --project-region (string)
          Default region where project resources should be created.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
