NAME
       list-package-version-assets -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of AssetSummary objects for assets in a package version.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-package-version-assets is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: assets

SYNOPSIS
            list-package-version-assets
          --domain <value>
          [--domain-owner <value>]
          --repository <value>
          --format <value>
          [--namespace <value>]
          --package <value>
          --package-version <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The  name of the domain that contains the repository associated with
          the package version assets.

       --domain-owner (string)
          The 12-digit account number of the AWS account that owns the domain.
          It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --repository (string)
          The  name  of the repository that contains the package that contains
          the returned package version assets.

       --format (string)
          The format of the package that contains the returned package version
          assets. The valid package types are:

          o npm : A Node Package Manager (npm) package.

          o pypi : A Python Package Index (PyPI) package.

          o maven  :  A  Maven  package  that contains compiled code in a dis-
            tributable format, such as a JAR file.

          Possible values:

          o npm

          o pypi

          o maven

          o nuget

       --namespace (string)
          The namespace of the package. The package component  that  specifies
          its namespace depends on its type. For example:

          o The namespace of a Maven package is its groupId .

          o The namespace of an npm package is its scope .

          o A  Python  package  does not contain a corresponding component, so
            Python packages do not have a namespace.

       --package (string)
          The name of the package that contains the returned  package  version
          assets.

       --package-version (string)
          A string that contains the package version (for example, 3.5.2 ).

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To view a package version's assets

       The following list-package-version-assets example retrieves the  assets
       for version 4.0.0 of an npm package named test-package.

          aws codeartifact list-package-version-assets \
              --domain test-domain \
              --repo test-repo \
              --format npm \
              --package test-package \
              --package-version 4.0.0

       Output:

          {
              "format": "npm",
              "package": "test-package",

                          "SHA-256": "d2aa8c6afc3c8591765785a37d1c5acae482a8eb3ab9729ed28922692454f2e2",
                          "SHA-512": "3e585d15c8a594e20d7de57b362ea81754c011acb2641a19f1b72c8531ea39825896bab344ae616a0a5a824cb9a381df0b3cddd534645cf305aba70a93dac698"

          }
