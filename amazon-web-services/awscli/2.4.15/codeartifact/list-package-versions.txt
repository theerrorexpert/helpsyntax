LIST-PACKAGE-VERSIONS()                                LIST-PACKAGE-VERSIONS()



NAME
       list-package-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of PackageVersionSummary objects for package versions in
       a repository that match the request parameters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-package-versions is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: versions

SYNOPSIS

          --domain <value>
          [--domain-owner <value>]
          --repository <value>
          --format <value>
          [--namespace <value>]
          --package <value>
          [--status <value>]
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The  name  of  the domain that contains the repository that contains
          the returned package versions.

       --domain-owner (string)
          The 12-digit account number of the AWS account that owns the domain.
          It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --repository (string)
          The name of the repository that contains the package.

       --format (string)
          The format of the returned packages. The valid package types are:

          o npm : A Node Package Manager (npm) package.

          o pypi : A Python Package Index (PyPI) package.

          o maven  :  A  Maven  package  that contains compiled code in a dis-
            tributable format, such as a JAR file.

          Possible values:

          o npm

          o pypi

          o maven

          o nuget

       --namespace (string)
          The namespace of the package. The package component  that  specifies
          its namespace depends on its type. For example:

          o The namespace of a Maven package is its groupId .

          o The namespace of an npm package is its scope .

          o A  Python  package  does not contain a corresponding component, so
            Python packages do not have a namespace.

       --package (string)
          The name of the package for which you want to return a list of pack-
          age versions.

       --status (string)
          A  string  that  specifies  the  status  of  the package versions to
          include in the returned list. It can be one of the following:

          o Published

          o Unfinished

          o Unlisted

          o Archived

          o Disposed

          Possible values:

          o Published

          o Unfinished

          o Unlisted

          o Archived

          o Disposed

          o Deleted

       --sort-by (string)
          How to sort the returned list of package versions.

          Possible values:

          o PUBLISHED_TIME

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list package versions for a package

       The  following  list-package-versions example returns a list of package
       versions for a package named kind-of.

          aws codeartifact list-package-versions \
              --package kind-of \
              --domain test-domain \
              --repository test-repo \
              --format npm

       Output:

          {
              "defaultDisplayVersion": "1.0.1",
              "format": "npm",
              "package": "kind-of",
              "versions": [
                  {
                      "version": "1.0.1",
                      "revision": "REVISION-SAMPLE-1-C7F4S5E9B772FC",
                      "status": "Published"
                  },
                  {
                      "version": "1.0.0",
                      "revision": "REVISION-SAMPLE-2-C752BEEF6D2CFC",
                      "status": "Published"
                  },
                  {
                      "version": "0.1.2",
                      "revision": "REVISION-SAMPLE-3-654S65A5C5E1FC",
                      "status": "Published"
                  },
                  {
                      "version": "0.1.1",
                      "revision": "REVISION-SAMPLE-1-C7F4S5E9B772FC"",
                      "status": "Published"
                  },
                  {
                      "version": "0.1.0",
                      "revision": "REVISION-SAMPLE-4-AF669139B772FC",
                      "status": "Published"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       defaultDisplayVersion -> (string)
          The  default package version to display. This depends on the package
          format:

          o For Maven and PyPI packages,  it's  the  most  recently  published
            package version.

          o For  npm  packages, it's the version referenced by the latest tag.
            If the latest tag is not set, it's  the  most  recently  published
            package version.

       format -> (string)
          A format of the package. Valid package format values are:

          o npm

          o pypi

          o maven

       namespace -> (string)
          The  namespace  of the package. The package component that specifies
          its namespace depends on its type. For example:

          o The namespace of a Maven package is its groupId .

          o The namespace of an npm package is its scope .

          o A Python package does not contain a  corresponding  component,  so
            Python packages do not have a namespace.

       package -> (string)
          The name of the package.

       versions -> (list)
          The returned list of PackageVersionSummary objects.

          (structure)
              Details  about a package version, including its status, version,
              and revision. The ListPackageVersions operation returns  a  list
              of PackageVersionSummary objects.

              version -> (string)
                 Information about a package version.

              revision -> (string)
                 The revision associated with a package version.

              status -> (string)
                 A  string that contains the status of the package version. It
                 can be one of the following:

                 o Published

                 o Unfinished

                 o Unlisted

                 o Archived

                 o Disposed

       nextToken -> (string)
          If there are additional results, this is the token for the next  set
          of results.
