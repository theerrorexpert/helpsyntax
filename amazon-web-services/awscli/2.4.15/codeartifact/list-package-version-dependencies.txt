NAME
       list-package-version-dependencies -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the direct dependencies for a package version. The dependencies
       are returned as PackageDependency objects.  CodeArtifact  extracts  the
       dependencies for a package version from the metadata file for the pack-
       age format (for example, the package.json file for npm packages and the
       pom.xml  file for Maven). Any package version dependencies that are not
       listed in the configuration file are not returned.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-package-version-dependencies
          --domain <value>
          [--domain-owner <value>]
          --repository <value>
          --format <value>
          [--namespace <value>]
          --package <value>
          --package-version <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain that contains the  repository  that  contains
          the requested package version dependencies.

       --domain-owner (string)
          The 12-digit account number of the AWS account that owns the domain.
          It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --repository (string)
          The name of the repository that contains the requested package  ver-
          sion.

       --format (string)
          The format of the package with the requested dependencies. The valid
          package types are:

          o npm : A Node Package Manager (npm) package.

          o pypi : A Python Package Index (PyPI) package.

          o maven : A Maven package that contains  compiled  code  in  a  dis-
            tributable format, such as a JAR file.

          Possible values:

          o npm

          o pypi

          o maven

          o nuget

       --namespace (string)
          The  namespace  of the package. The package component that specifies
          its namespace depends on its type. For example:

          o The namespace of a Maven package is its groupId .

          o The namespace of an npm package is its scope .

          o A Python package does not contain a  corresponding  component,  so
            Python packages do not have a namespace.

       --package (string)
          The name of the package versions' package.

       --package-version (string)
          A string that contains the package version (for example, 3.5.2 ).

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next set of results. Use the value returned in the
          previous response in the next request to retrieve the  next  set  of
          results.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To view a package version's dependencies

       The  following  list-package-version-dependencies example retrieves the
       dependencies for version 4.0.0 of an npm package named test-package.

          aws codeartifact list-package-version-dependencies \
              --domain test-domain \
              --repo test-repo \
              --format npm \
              --package test-package \
              --package-version 4.0.0

       Output:

          {
              "format": "npm",
              "package": "test-package",
              "version": "4.0.0",
              "versionRevision": "Ciqe5/9yicvkJT13b5/LdLpCyE6fqA7poa9qp+FilPs=",
              "dependencies": [
                  {
                      "namespace": "testns",
                      "package": "testdep1",
                      "dependencyType": "regular",
                      "versionRequirement": "1.8.5"
                  },
                  {
                      "namespace": "testns",
                      "package": "testdep2",
                      "dependencyType": "regular",
                      "versionRequirement": "1.8.5"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       format -> (string)
          A  format  that  specifies the type of the package that contains the
          returned dependencies. The valid values are:

          o npm

          o pypi

          o maven

       namespace -> (string)
          The namespace of the package. The package component  that  specifies
          its namespace depends on its type. For example:

          o The namespace of a Maven package is its groupId .

          o The namespace of an npm package is its scope .

          o A  Python  package  does not contain a corresponding component, so
            Python packages do not have a namespace.

       package -> (string)
          The name of the package that contains the returned package  versions
          dependencies.

       version -> (string)
          The version of the package that is specified in the request.

       versionRevision -> (string)
          The current revision associated with the package version.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results. Use the value returned in the
          previous response in the next request to retrieve the  next  set  of
          results.

       dependencies -> (list)
          The returned list of PackageDependency objects.

          (structure)
              Details about a package dependency.

              namespace -> (string)
                 The  namespace  of  the  package.  The package component that
                 specifies its namespace depends on its type. For example:

                 o The namespace of a Maven package is its groupId .

                 o The namespace of an npm package is its scope .

                 o A Python package does not contain  a  corresponding  compo-
                   nent, so Python packages do not have a namespace.

              package -> (string)
                 The name of the package that this package depends on.

              dependencyType -> (string)
                 The  type of a package dependency. The possible values depend
                 on the package type. Example types are compile  ,  runtime  ,
                 and  test  for  Maven packages, and dev , prod , and optional
                 for npm packages.

              versionRequirement -> (string)
                 The required version, or version range, of the  package  that
                 this  package  depends  on. The version format is specific to
                 the package type. For example,  the  following  are  possible
                 valid required versions: 1.2.3 , ^2.3.4 , or 4.x .
