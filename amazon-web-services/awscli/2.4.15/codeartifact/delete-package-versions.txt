DELETE-PACKAGE-VERSIONS()                            DELETE-PACKAGE-VERSIONS()



NAME
       delete-package-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  one  or  more versions of a package. A deleted package version
       cannot be restored in your repository. If you want to remove a  package
       version  from  your repository and be able to restore it later, set its
       status to Archived . Archived packages  cannot  be  downloaded  from  a
       repository  and  don't  show  up  with  list package APIs (for example,
       ListackageVersions   ),   but    you    can    restore    them    using
       UpdatePackageVersionsStatus .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-package-versions
          --domain <value>
          [--domain-owner <value>]
          --repository <value>
          --format <value>
          [--namespace <value>]
          --package <value>
          --versions <value>
          [--expected-status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain that contains the package to delete.

       --domain-owner (string)
          The 12-digit account number of the AWS account that owns the domain.
          It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --repository (string)
          The name of the repository that contains  the  package  versions  to
          delete.

       --format (string)
          The format of the package versions to delete. The valid values are:

          o npm

          o pypi

          o maven

          Possible values:

          o npm

          o pypi

          o maven

          o nuget

       --namespace (string)
          The  namespace  of the package. The package component that specifies
          its namespace depends on its type. For example:

          o The namespace of a Maven package is its groupId .

          o The namespace of an npm package is its scope .

          o A Python package does not contain a  corresponding  component,  so
            Python packages do not have a namespace.

       --package (string)
          The name of the package with the versions to delete.

       --versions (list)
          An  array  of  strings  that  specify the versions of the package to
          delete.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --expected-status (string)
          The expected status of the package version to delete.  Valid  values
          are:

          o Published

          o Unfinished

          o Unlisted

          o Archived

          o Disposed

          Possible values:

          o Published

          o Unfinished

          o Unlisted

          o Archived

          o Disposed

          o Deleted

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete package versions

       The  following delete-package-versions example deletes version 4.0.0 of
       a package named test-package.

          aws codeartifact delete-package-versions \
              --domain test-domain \
              --repo test-repo \
              --format npm \
              --package test-package \
              --versions 4.0.0

       Output:

          {
              "successfulVersions": {
                  "4.0.0": {
                      "revision": "Ciqe5/9yicvkJT13b5/LdLpCyE6fqA7poa9qp+FilPs=",
                      "status": "Deleted"
                  }
              },
              "failedVersions": {}
          }
