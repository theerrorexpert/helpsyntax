NAME
       describe-repository -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a RepositoryDescription object that contains detailed informa-
       tion about the requested repository.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-repository
          --domain <value>
          [--domain-owner <value>]
          --repository <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain that contains the repository to describe.

       --domain-owner (string)
          The 12-digit account number of the AWS account that owns the domain.
          It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --repository (string)
          A string that specifies the name of the requested repository.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about a repository

       The  following describe-repository example returns a RepositoryDescrip-
       tion object for a repository named test-repo.

          aws codeartifact describe-repository \
              --domain test-domain \
              --repository test-repo

       Output:

          {
              "repository": {
                  "name": "test-repo",
                  "administratorAccount": "111122223333",

                  "arn": "arn:aws:codeartifact:us-west-2:111122223333:repository/test-domain/test-repo",
                  "description": "This is a test repository.",
                  "upstreams": [],
                  "externalConnections": []
              }
