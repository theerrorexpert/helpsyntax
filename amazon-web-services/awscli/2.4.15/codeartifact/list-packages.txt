LIST-PACKAGES()                                                LIST-PACKAGES()



NAME
       list-packages -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of PackageSummary objects for packages in a repository
       that match the request parameters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-packages is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: packages

SYNOPSIS
            list-packages
          --domain <value>
          [--domain-owner <value>]
          --repository <value>
          [--format <value>]
          [--namespace <value>]
          [--package-prefix <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The  name  of  the domain that contains the repository that contains
          the requested list of packages.

       --domain-owner (string)
          The 12-digit account number of the AWS account that owns the domain.
          It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --repository (string)
          The name of the repository from which packages are to be listed.

       --format (string)
          The format of the packages. The valid package types are:

          o npm : A Node Package Manager (npm) package.

          o pypi : A Python Package Index (PyPI) package.

          o maven  :  A  Maven  package  that contains compiled code in a dis-
            tributable format, such as a JAR file.

          Possible values:

          o npm

          o pypi

          o maven

          o nuget

       --namespace (string)
          The namespace of the package. The package component  that  specifies
          its namespace depends on its type. For example:

          o The namespace of a Maven package is its groupId .

          o The namespace of an npm package is its scope .

          o A  Python  package  does not contain a corresponding component, so
            Python packages do not have a namespace.

       --package-prefix (string)
          A prefix used to filter returned packages. Only packages with  names
          that start with packagePrefix are returned.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list packages in a repository

       The following list-packages example list packages in a repository named
       test-repo in a domain named test-domain.

          aws codeartifact list-packages \
              --domain test-domain \
              --repository test-repo

       Output:

          {
              "packages": [
                  {
                      "format": "npm",
                      "package": "lodash"
                  }
                  {
                      "format": "python",
                      "package": "test-package"
                  }
              ]
          }

       User Guide.

OUTPUT
       packages -> (list)
          The list of returned PackageSummary objects.

          (structure)
              Details about a package, including its  format,  namespace,  and
              name.  The  ListPackages operation returns a list of PackageSum-
              mary objects.

              format -> (string)
                 The format of the package. Valid values are:

                 o npm

                 o pypi

                 o maven

              namespace -> (string)
                 The namespace of the  package.  The  package  component  that
                 specifies its namespace depends on its type. For example:

                 o The namespace of a Maven package is its groupId .

                 o The namespace of an npm package is its scope .

                 o A  Python  package  does not contain a corresponding compo-
                   nent, so Python packages do not have a namespace.

              package -> (string)
                 The name of the package.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If there are additional results, this is the token for the next  set
          of results.
