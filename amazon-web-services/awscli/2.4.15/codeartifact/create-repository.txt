          [--upstreams <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain that contains the created repository.

       --domain-owner (string)
          The 12-digit account number of the AWS account that owns the domain.
          It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --repository (string)
          The name of the repository to create.

       --description (string)
          A description of the created repository.

       --upstreams (list)
          A list of upstream repositories to associate  with  the  repository.
          The  order of the upstream repositories in the list determines their
          priority order when AWS CodeArtifact looks for a  requested  package
          version.  For  more information, see Working with upstream reposito-
          ries .

          (structure)
              Information about an upstream repository. A  list  of  Upstream-
              Repository objects is an input parameter to CreateRepository and
              UpdateRepository .

              repositoryName -> (string)
                 The name of an upstream repository.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          repositoryName=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "repositoryName": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --tags (list)
          One or more tag key-value pairs for the repository.

          (structure)
              A tag is a key-value pair that can be  used  to  manage,  search
              for, or filter resources in AWS CodeArtifact.

              key -> (string)
                 The tag key.

              value -> (string)
                 The tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a repository

       The  following  create-repository  example  creates  a repository named
       test-repo inside a domain named test-domain.

          aws codeartifact create-repository \
              --domain test-domain \
              --domain-owner 111122223333 \
              --repository test-repo \
              --description "This is a test repository."

       Output:

          {
              "repository": {
                  "name": "test-repo",
                  "administratorAccount": "111122223333",
                  "domainName": "test-domain",
                  "domainOwner": "111122223333",
                  "arn": "arn:aws:codeartifact:us-west-2:111122223333:repository/test-domain/test-repo",
                  "description": "This is a test repository.",
                  "upstreams": [],
                  "externalConnections": []
              }
