CREATE-DOMAIN()                                                CREATE-DOMAIN()



NAME
       create-domain -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a domain. CodeArtifact domains make it easier to manage multi-
       ple repositories across an organization. You can use a domain to  apply
       permissions  across  many repositories owned by different AWS accounts.
       An asset is stored only once in a domain,  even  if  it's  in  multiple
       repositories.

       Although  you  can have multiple domains, we recommend a single produc-
       tion domain that contains all published artifacts so that your develop-
       ment  teams  can find and share packages. You can use a second pre-pro-
       duction domain to test changes to the production domain  configuration.

SYNOPSIS
            create-domain
          --domain <value>
          [--encryption-key <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The  name of the domain to create. All domain names in an AWS Region
          that are in the same AWS account must be unique. The domain name  is
          used  as  the prefix in DNS hostnames. Do not use sensitive informa-
          tion in a domain name because it is publicly discoverable.

       --encryption-key (string)
          The encryption key for the domain. This is used to  encrypt  content
          stored  in a domain. An encryption key can be a key ID, a key Amazon
          Resource Name (ARN), a key alias, or a key alias ARN. To specify  an
          encryptionKey , your IAM role must have kms:DescribeKey and kms:Cre-
          ateGrant permissions on the encryption key that is  used.  For  more
          information,  see  DescribeKey in the AWS Key Management Service API
          Reference and AWS KMS API Permissions Reference in the AWS Key  Man-
          agement Service Developer Guide .

          WARNING:
              CodeArtifact  supports  only symmetric CMKs. Do not associate an
              asymmetric CMK with your domain. For more information, see Using
              symmetric  and asymmetric keys in the AWS Key Management Service
              Developer Guide .

       --tags (list)
          One or more tag key-value pairs for the domain.

          (structure)
              A tag is a key-value pair that can be  used  to  manage,  search
              for, or filter resources in AWS CodeArtifact.

              key -> (string)
                 The tag key.

              value -> (string)
                 The tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a domain

       The following create-domain example creates a domain named test-domain.

          aws codeartifact create-domain \
              --domain test-domain

       Output:

          {
              "domain": {
                  "name": "test-domain",
                  "owner": "111122223333",
                  "arn": "arn:aws:codeartifact:us-west-2:111122223333:domain/test-domain",
                  "status": "Active",
                  "createdTime": "2020-10-20T13:16:48.559000-04:00",
                  "encryptionKey": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                  "repositoryCount": 0,
                  "assetSizeBytes": 0
              }
          }
