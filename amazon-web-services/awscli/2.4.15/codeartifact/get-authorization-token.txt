GET-AUTHORIZATION-TOKEN()                            GET-AUTHORIZATION-TOKEN()



NAME
       get-authorization-token -

DESCRIPTION
       Generates a temporary authorization token for accessing repositories in
       the domain. This API  requires  the  codeartifact:GetAuthorizationToken
       and  sts:GetServiceBearerToken  permissions. For more information about
       authorization tokens, see AWS CodeArtifact authentication and tokens  .

       NOTE:
          CodeArtifact authorization tokens are valid for a period of 12 hours
          when created with the login command. You can call login periodically
          to  refresh  the  token. When you create an authorization token with
          the GetAuthorizationToken API, you can set  a  custom  authorization
          period, up to a maximum of 12 hours, with the durationSeconds param-
          eter.

          The authorization period begins after login or GetAuthorizationToken
          is  called. If login or GetAuthorizationToken is called while assum-
          ing a role, the token lifetime is independent of the maximum session
          duration  of  the role. For example, if you call sts assume-role and
          specify a session duration of 15 minutes, then generate a  CodeArti-
          fact  authorization  token,  the  token  will  be valid for the full
          authorization period even though this is longer than  the  15-minute
          session duration.

          See  Using  IAM  Roles  for  more information on controlling session
          duration.

SYNOPSIS
            get-authorization-token
          --domain <value>
          [--domain-owner <value>]
          [--duration-seconds <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain that is in scope for the generated authoriza-
          tion token.

       --domain-owner (string)
          The 12-digit account number of the AWS account that owns the domain.
          It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --duration-seconds (long)
          The time, in seconds, that  the  generated  authorization  token  is
          valid.  Valid  values  are 0 and any number between 900 (15 minutes)
          and 43200 (12 hours). A value of 0 will set the  expiration  of  the
          authorization token to the same expiration of the user's role's tem-
          porary credentials.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get an authorization token

       The following get-authorization-token example retrieves a  CodeArtifact
       authorization token.

          aws codeartifact get-authorization-token \
              --domain test-domain \
              --query authorizationToken \
              --output text

       Output:

          This command will return the authorization token. You can store the output in an environment variable when calling the command.

       For  more  information,  see Configure pip without the login command in
       the AWS CodeArtifact User Guide.

OUTPUT
       authorizationToken -> (string)
          The returned authentication token.

       expiration -> (timestamp)
          A timestamp that specifies the date and time the authorization token
          expires.
