NAME
       delete-domain-permissions-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the resource policy set on a domain.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-domain-permissions-policy
          --domain <value>
          [--domain-owner <value>]
          [--policy-revision <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The  name  of  the  domain associated with the resource policy to be
          deleted.

       --domain-owner (string)
          The 12-digit account number of the AWS account that owns the domain.
          It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --policy-revision (string)
          The  current  revision  of  the  resource policy to be deleted. This
          revision is used for optimistic locking, which prevents others  from
          overwriting your changes to the domain's resource policy.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete the permissions policy document from a domain

       The following delete-domain-permissions-policy example deletes the per-
       mission policy from a domain named test-domain.

          aws codeartifact delete-domain-permissions-policy \
              --domain test-domain

       Output:

          {
