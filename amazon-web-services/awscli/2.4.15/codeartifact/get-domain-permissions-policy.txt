GET-DOMAIN-PERMISSIONS-POLICY()                GET-DOMAIN-PERMISSIONS-POLICY()



NAME
       get-domain-permissions-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the resource policy attached to the specified domain.

       NOTE:
          The policy is a resource-based policy, not an identity-based policy.
          For more information, see Identity-based policies and resource-based
          policies in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-domain-permissions-policy
          --domain <value>
          [--domain-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain to which the resource policy is attached.

       --domain-owner (string)
          The 12-digit account number of the AWS account that owns the domain.
          It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the permissions policy document for a domain

       The following get-domain-permissions-policy example gets the permission
       policy attached to a domain named test-domain.

          aws codeartifact get-domain-permissions-policy \
              --domain test-domain

       Output:

          {
              "Version": "2012-10-17",
              "Statement": [

                          "codeartifact:ListRepositoriesInDomain",
                          "codeartifact:GetAuthorizationToken",
                          "codeartifact:CreateRepository"
                      ],
                      "Effect": "Allow",
