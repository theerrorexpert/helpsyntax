LIST-DOMAINS()                                                  LIST-DOMAINS()



NAME
       list-domains -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of DomainSummary objects for all domains owned by the
       AWS account that makes this call. Each  returned  DomainSummary  object
       contains information about a domain.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-domains is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: domains

SYNOPSIS
            list-domains
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list domains

       The  following  list-domains  example  returns a summary of all domains
       owned by the AWS account that makes the call.

          aws codeartifact list-domains

       Output:

          {
              "domains": [
                  {
                      "name": "my-domain",
                      "owner": "111122223333",
                      "status": "Active",
                      "encryptionKey": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"
                  },
                  {
                      "name": "test-domain",
                      "owner": "111122223333",
                      "status": "Active",
                      "encryptionKey": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222"
                  }
              ]
          }

          (structure)
              Information  about a domain, including its name, Amazon Resource
              Name (ARN), and status. The ListDomains operation returns a list
              of DomainSummary objects.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the domain.

              owner -> (string)
                 The  12-digit account number of the AWS account that owns the
                 domain. It does not include dashes or spaces.

              arn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the domain.

              status -> (string)
                 A string that contains the status of the  domain.  The  valid
                 values are:

                 o Active

                 o Deleted

              createdTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  timestamp  that  contains the date and time the domain was
                 created.

              encryptionKey -> (string)
                 The key used to encrypt the domain.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results. Use the value returned in the
          previous  response  in  the next request to retrieve the next set of
          results.
