DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Web  Services  Outposts is a fully managed service that extends
       Amazon  Web  Services  infrastructure,  APIs,  and  tools  to  customer
       premises.  By providing local access to Amazon Web Services managed in-
       frastructure, Amazon Web Services Outposts enables customers  to  build
       and  run applications on premises using the same programming interfaces
       as in Amazon Web Services Regions, while using local compute and  stor-
       age resources for lower latency and local data processing needs.
