CREATE-WORKFLOW()                                            CREATE-WORKFLOW()



NAME
       create-workflow -

DESCRIPTION
       Allows  you  to create a workflow with specified steps and step details
       the workflow invokes after file transfer completes.  After  creating  a
       workflow,  you  can  associate  the  workflow created with any transfer
       servers by specifying the workflow-details field  in  CreateServer  and
       UpdateServer operations.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-workflow
          [--description <value>]
          --steps <value>
          [--on-exception-steps <value>]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          A textual description for the workflow.

       --steps (list)
          Specifies  the details for the steps that are in the specified work-
          flow.

          The TYPE specifies which of the following actions is being taken for
          this step.

          o Copy : copy the file to another location

          o Custom : custom step with a lambda target

          o Delete : delete the file

          EFS filesystem ID and path.

       --on-exception-steps (list)
          Specifies the steps (actions) to take if errors are encountered dur-
          ing execution of the workflow.

          NOTE:
              For custom steps, the lambda function needs to send  FAILURE  to
              the call back API to kick off the exception steps. Additionally,
              if the lambda does not send SUCCESS before  it  times  out,  the
              exception steps are executed.

       --tags (list)
          Key-value pairs that can be used to group and search for  workflows.
          Tags are metadata attached to workflows for any purpose.

          (structure)
              Creates a key-value pair for a specific resource. Tags are meta-
              data that you can use to search for and  group  a  resource  for
              various  purposes.  You  can  apply  tags to servers, users, and
              roles. A tag key can take more than one value. For  example,  to
              group  servers  for  accounting purposes, you might create a tag
              called Group and assign the values Research  and  Accounting  to
              that group.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name assigned to the tag that you create.

              Value -> (string)
                 Contains one or more values that you assigned to the key name
                 you create.

            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       WorkflowId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the workflow.
