LIST-ACCESSES()                                                LIST-ACCESSES()



NAME
       list-accesses -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the details for all the accesses you have on your server.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-accesses
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          --server-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          Specifies the maximum number of access SIDs to return.

       --next-token (string)
          When  you  can  get additional results from the ListAccesses call, a
          NextToken parameter is returned in the output. You can then pass  in
          a  subsequent command to the NextToken parameter to continue listing
          additional accesses.

       --server-id (string)
          A system-assigned unique identifier for  a  server  that  has  users
          assigned to it.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          When  you  can  get additional results from the ListAccesses call, a
          NextToken parameter is returned in the output. You can then pass  in
          a  subsequent command to the NextToken parameter to continue listing
          additional accesses.

       ServerId -> (string)
          A system-assigned unique identifier for  a  server  that  has  users
          assigned to it.

       Accesses -> (list)
          Returns  the  accesses  and  their properties for the ServerId value
          that you specify.

          (structure)
              Lists the  properties  for  one  or  more  specified  associated
              accesses.

              HomeDirectory -> (string)
                 The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to
                 the server using the client.

                 A HomeDirectory example is /bucket_name/home/mydirectory .

              HomeDirectoryType -> (string)
                 The type of landing directory (folder) you want  your  users'
                 home  directory  to  be when they log into the server. If you
                 set it to PATH , the user will see  the  absolute  Amazon  S3
                 bucket  or  EFS  paths  as is in their file transfer protocol
                 clients. If you set it LOGICAL , you need to provide mappings
                 in  the HomeDirectoryMappings for how you want to make Amazon
                 S3 or EFS paths visible to your users.

              Role -> (string)
                 Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that
                 controls  your  users' access to your Amazon S3 bucket or EFS
                 file system. The policies attached to this role determine the
                 level  of  access  that  you  want to provide your users when
                 transferring files into and out of your Amazon S3  bucket  or
                 EFS  file  system.  The  IAM role should also contain a trust
                 relationship that allows the server to access your  resources
                 when servicing your users' transfer requests.

              ExternalId -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier  that  is required to identify specific
                 groups within your directory. The users of the group that you
                 associate  have  access  to  your  Amazon  S3  or  Amazon EFS
                 resources over the enabled protocols using  Amazon  Web  Ser-
                 vices  Transfer  Family.  If you know the group name, you can
                 view the SID values by running the  following  command  using
                 Windows PowerShell.
                     Get-ADGroup  -Filter  {samAccountName  -like "*YourGroup-
                     Name* *"} -Properties * | Select SamAccountName,ObjectSid

                 In  that command, replace YourGroupName with the name of your
                 Active Directory group.

                 The regex used to validate this  parameter  is  a  string  of
                 characters consisting of uppercase and lowercase alphanumeric
                 characters with no spaces. You can also  include  underscores
                 or any of the following characters: =,.@:/-
