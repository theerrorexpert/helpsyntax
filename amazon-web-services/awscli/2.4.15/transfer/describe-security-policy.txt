NAME
       describe-security-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  security  policy that is attached to your file transfer
       protocol-enabled server. The response contains  a  description  of  the
       security policy's properties. For more information about security poli-
       cies, see Working with security policies .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-security-policy
          --security-policy-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --security-policy-name (string)
          Specifies the name of the security policy that is  attached  to  the
          server.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          SecurityPolicyName -> (string)
              Specifies the name of the security policy that  is  attached  to

          SshCiphers -> (list)
              Specifies the enabled Secure Shell (SSH) cipher encryption algo-
              rithms in the security policy that is attached to the server.

          TlsCiphers -> (list)
              Specifies  the  enabled  Transport  Layer  Security (TLS) cipher
