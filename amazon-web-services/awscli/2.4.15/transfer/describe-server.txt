DESCRIBE-SERVER()                                            DESCRIBE-SERVER()



NAME
       describe-server -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  a  file transfer protocol-enabled server that you specify by
       passing the ServerId parameter.

       The response contains a description of a server's properties. When  you
       set  EndpointType to VPC, the response will contain the EndpointDetails
       .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-server
          --server-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --server-id (string)
          A system-assigned unique identifier for a server.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Server -> (structure)
          An array containing the properties of a server with the ServerID you
          specified.

          Arn -> (string)
              Specifies the unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the server.

          Certificate -> (string)
              Specifies  the ARN of the Amazon Web ServicesCertificate Manager
              (ACM) certificate. Required when Protocols is set to FTPS .

          ProtocolDetails -> (structure)
              The protocol settings that are configured for your server.

              Use the PassiveIp parameter to indicate passive  mode.  Enter  a
              single dotted-quad IPv4 address, such as the external IP address
              of a firewall, router, or load balancer.

              PassiveIp -> (string)
                 Indicates passive mode, for FTP and FTPS protocols.  Enter  a
                 single  dotted-quad  IPv4  address,  such  as the external IP
                 address of a firewall, router, or load balancer. For example:

                     ``
                     aws   transfer   update-server   --protocol-details  Pas-
                     siveIp=*0.0.0.0* ``

                 Replace `` 0.0.0.0 `` in the example above with the actual IP
                 address you want to use.

                 NOTE:
                     If you change the PassiveIp value, you must stop and then
                     restart your Transfer  server  for  the  change  to  take
                     effect.  For  details on using Passive IP (PASV) in a NAT
                     environment, see Configuring your FTPS  server  behind  a
                     firewall  or NAT with Amazon Web Services Transfer Family
                     .

              TlsSessionResumptionMode -> (string)
                 A property used with Transfer servers that use the FTPS  pro-
                 tocol.  TLS Session Resumption provides a mechanism to resume
                 or share a negotiated secret key between the control and data
                 connection  for  an  FTPS  session.  TlsSessionResumptionMode
                 determines whether or not the server resumes recent,  negoti-
                 ated  sessions  through a unique session ID. This property is
                 available during CreateServer and UpdateServer  calls.  If  a
                 TlsSessionResumptionMode  value  is not specified during Cre-
                 ateServer, it is set to ENFORCED by default.

                 o DISABLED : the server does not process TLS session  resump-
                   tion client requests and creates a new TLS session for each
                   request.

                 o ENABLED : the server processes and accepts clients that are
                   performing  TLS  session  resumption.  The  server  doesn't
                   reject client data connections that do not perform the  TLS
                   session resumption client processing.

                 o ENFORCED  :  the  server processes and accepts clients that
                   are performing TLS session resumption. The  server  rejects
                   client data connections that do not perform the TLS session
                   resumption client processing. Before you set the  value  to
                   ENFORCED , test your clients.

                 NOTE:
                     Not  all FTPS clients perform TLS session resumption. So,
                     if you choose to enforce TLS session resumption, you pre-
                     vent any connections from FTPS clients that don't perform
                     the protocol negotiation. To determine whether or not you
                     can  use  the  ENFORCED  value,  you  need  to  test your
                     clients.

          Domain -> (string)
              Specifies the domain of the storage system that is used for file
              transfers.

          EndpointDetails -> (structure)
              The  virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint settings that are con-
              figured for your server. When you host your endpoint within your
              VPC,  you  can  make it accessible only to resources within your
              VPC, or you can attach Elastic IP addresses and make it accessi-
              ble  to  clients  over the internet. Your VPC's default security
              groups are automatically assigned to your endpoint.

              AddressAllocationIds -> (list)
                 A list of address allocation IDs that are required to  attach
                 an Elastic IP address to your server's endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to
                     VPC and it is only valid in the UpdateServer API.

                 (string)

              SubnetIds -> (list)
                 A list of subnet IDs that are required to  host  your  server
                 endpoint in your VPC.

                 NOTE:
                     This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to
                     VPC .

                 (string)

              VpcEndpointId -> (string)
                 The ID of the VPC endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to
                     VPC_ENDPOINT .

                     For            more            information,           see
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/create-server-in-vpc.html#deprecate-vpc-endpoint.

              VpcId -> (string)
                 The  VPC  ID  of the VPC in which a server's endpoint will be
                 hosted.

                 NOTE:
                     This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to
                     VPC .

              SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                 A list of security groups IDs that are available to attach to
                 your server's endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to
                     VPC .

                     You   can  edit  the  SecurityGroupIds  property  in  the
                     UpdateServer API only if you are changing  the  Endpoint-
                     Type from PUBLIC or VPC_ENDPOINT to VPC . To change secu-
                     rity groups associated with your  server's  VPC  endpoint
                     after creation, use the Amazon EC2 ModifyVpcEndpoint API.

                 (string)

          EndpointType -> (string)
              Defines the type of endpoint that your server is  connected  to.
              If your server is connected to a VPC endpoint, your server isn't
              accessible over the public internet.

          HostKeyFingerprint -> (string)
              Specifies the Base64-encoded SHA256 fingerprint of the  server's
              host key. This value is equivalent to the output of the ssh-key-
              gen -l -f my-new-server-key command.

          IdentityProviderDetails -> (structure)
              Specifies information to call a customer-supplied authentication
              API.  This  field is not populated when the IdentityProviderType
              of a server is AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE or SERVICE_MANAGED .

              Url -> (string)
                 Provides the location of the service endpoint used to authen-
                 ticate users.

              InvocationRole -> (string)
                 Provides  the type of InvocationRole used to authenticate the
                 user account.

              DirectoryId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the Amazon Web Services  Directory  Service
                 directory that you want to stop sharing.

              Function -> (string)
                 The  ARN  for  a  lambda  function  to  use  for the Identity
                 provider.

          IdentityProviderType -> (string)
              Specifies the mode of authentication for a server.  The  default
              value  is SERVICE_MANAGED , which allows you to store and access
              user credentials within the Amazon Web Services Transfer  Family
              service.

              Use  AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE to provide access to Active Directory
              groups in  Amazon  Web  Services  Managed  Active  Directory  or
              Microsoft Active Directory in your on-premises environment or in
              Amazon Web  Services  using  AD  Connectors.  This  option  also
              requires  you  to  provide  a  Directory  ID  using  the Identi-
              tyProviderDetails parameter.

              Use the API_GATEWAY value to integrate with an identity provider
              of  your  choosing. The API_GATEWAY setting requires you to pro-
              vide an API Gateway endpoint  URL  to  call  for  authentication
              using the IdentityProviderDetails parameter.

              Use  the  AWS_LAMBDA  value to directly use a Lambda function as
              your identity provider. If you choose this value, you must spec-
              ify  the  ARN  for the lambda function in the Function parameter
              for the IdentityProviderDetails data type.

          LoggingRole -> (string)
              Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web  Ser-
              vices  Identity  and  Access Management (IAM) role that allows a
              server to turn on Amazon CloudWatch logging  for  Amazon  S3  or
              Amazon EFS events. When set, user activity can be viewed in your
              CloudWatch logs.

          Protocols -> (list)
              Specifies the file transfer protocol  or  protocols  over  which
              your  file transfer protocol client can connect to your server's
              endpoint. The available protocols are:

              o SFTP (Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol): File  trans-
                fer over SSH

              o FTPS  (File  Transfer Protocol Secure): File transfer with TLS
                encryption

              o FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Unencrypted file transfer

              (string)

          SecurityPolicyName -> (string)
              Specifies the name of the security policy that  is  attached  to
              the server.

          ServerId -> (string)
              Specifies  the  unique  system-assigned  identifier for a server
              that you instantiate.

          State -> (string)
              Specifies the condition of a server  for  the  server  that  was
              described.  A  value  of  ONLINE  indicates  that the server can
              accept jobs and transfer files. A State value of  OFFLINE  means
              that the server cannot perform file transfer operations.

              The  states of STARTING and STOPPING indicate that the server is
              in an intermediate state, either not fully able to  respond,  or
              not fully offline. The values of START_FAILED or STOP_FAILED can
              indicate an error condition.

          Tags -> (list)
              Specifies the key-value pairs that you can use to search for and
              group  servers  that  were  assigned  to  the  server  that  was
              described.

              (structure)
                 Creates a key-value pair for a specific  resource.  Tags  are
                 metadata  that you can use to search for and group a resource
                 for various purposes. You can apply tags to  servers,  users,
                 and  roles. A tag key can take more than one value. For exam-
                 ple, to group servers for accounting purposes, you might cre-
                 ate  a  tag  called  Group and assign the values Research and
                 Accounting to that group.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The name assigned to the tag that you create.

                 Value -> (string)
                     Contains one or more values that you assigned to the  key
                     name you create.

          UserCount -> (integer)
              Specifies  the number of users that are assigned to a server you
              specified with the ServerId .

          WorkflowDetails -> (structure)
              Specifies the workflow ID for the workflow  to  assign  and  the
              execution role used for executing the workflow.

              OnUpload -> (list)
                 A trigger that starts a workflow: the workflow begins to exe-
                 cute after a file is uploaded.

                 (structure)
                     Specifies the workflow ID for the workflow to assign  and
                     the execution role used for executing the workflow.

                     WorkflowId -> (string)
                        A unique identifier for the workflow.

                     ExecutionRole -> (string)
                        Includes  the  necessary  permissions for S3, EFS, and
                        Lambda operations that Transfer can  assume,  so  that
                        all   workflow  steps  can  operate  on  the  required
                        resources
