START-SERVER()                                                  START-SERVER()



NAME
       start-server -

DESCRIPTION
       Changes  the  state  of  a  file  transfer protocol-enabled server from
       OFFLINE to ONLINE . It has no impact on a server that is already ONLINE
       . An ONLINE server can accept and process file transfer jobs.

       The  state  of STARTING indicates that the server is in an intermediate
       state, either not fully able to respond, or not fully online. The  val-
       ues of START_FAILED can indicate an error condition.

       No response is returned from this call.

SYNOPSIS
            start-server
          --server-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --server-id (string)
          A system-assigned unique identifier for a server that you start.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
