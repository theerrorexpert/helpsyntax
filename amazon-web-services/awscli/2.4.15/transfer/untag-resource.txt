NAME
       untag-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Detaches  a key-value pair from a resource, as identified by its Amazon
       Resource Name (ARN). Resources are users,  servers,  roles,  and  other
       entities.

       No response is returned from this call.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            untag-resource
          --arn <value>
          --tag-keys <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The  value of the resource that will have the tag removed. An Amazon
          Resource Name (ARN) is an identifier for a specific Amazon Web  Ser-
          vices resource, such as a server, user, or role.

       --tag-keys (list)
          TagKeys  are  key-value  pairs  assigned to ARNs that can be used to
          group and search  for  resources  by  type.  This  metadata  can  be
          attached to resources for any purpose.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
