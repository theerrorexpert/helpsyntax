       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-access
          --server-id <value>
          --external-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --server-id (string)
          A system-assigned unique identifier for a server that has this  user
          assigned.

       --external-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier  that  is required to identify specific groups
          within your directory. The users of the  group  that  you  associate
          have  access  to  your  Amazon  S3  or Amazon EFS resources over the
          enabled protocols using Amazon Web Services Transfer Family. If  you
          know the group name, you can view the SID values by running the fol-
          lowing command using Windows PowerShell.
              Get-ADGroup -Filter {samAccountName -like  "*YourGroupName*  *"}
              -Properties * | Select SamAccountName,ObjectSid

          In  that command, replace YourGroupName with the name of your Active
          Directory group.

          The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of  characters
          consisting  of  uppercase and lowercase alphanumeric characters with
          no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the  following
          characters: =,.@:/-

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
