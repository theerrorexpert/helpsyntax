SYNOPSIS
            tag-resource
          --arn <value>
          --tags <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          An  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) for a specific Amazon Web Services
          resource, such as a server, user, or role.

       --tags (list)
          Key-value pairs assigned to ARNs that  you  can  use  to  group  and
          search  for  resources by type. You can attach this metadata to user
          accounts for any purpose.

          (structure)
              Creates a key-value pair for a specific resource. Tags are meta-
              data  that  you  can  use to search for and group a resource for
              various purposes. You can apply  tags  to  servers,  users,  and
              roles.  A  tag key can take more than one value. For example, to
              group servers for accounting purposes, you might  create  a  tag
              called  Group  and  assign the values Research and Accounting to
              that group.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name assigned to the tag that you create.

              Value -> (string)
                 Contains one or more values that you assigned to the key name
                 you create.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
