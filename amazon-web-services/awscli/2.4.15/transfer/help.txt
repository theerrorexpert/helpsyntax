DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Web  Services  Transfer  Family is a fully managed service that
       enables the transfer of files over the File  Transfer  Protocol  (FTP),
       File  Transfer  Protocol  over  SSL  (FTPS), or Secure Shell (SSH) File
       Transfer Protocol (SFTP) directly into and out of Amazon Simple Storage
       Service  (Amazon  S3). Amazon Web Services helps you seamlessly migrate
       your file transfer workflows to Amazon Web Services Transfer Family  by
       integrating  with  existing  authentication  systems, and providing DNS
       routing with Amazon Route 53 so nothing changes for your customers  and
       partners,  or  their applications. With your data in Amazon S3, you can
       use it with Amazon Web Services  services  for  processing,  analytics,
       machine  learning,  and archiving. Getting started with Amazon Web Ser-
       vices Transfer Family is easy since there is no infrastructure  to  buy
       and set up.
