TEST-IDENTITY-PROVIDER()                              TEST-IDENTITY-PROVIDER()



NAME
       test-identity-provider -

DESCRIPTION
       If  the IdentityProviderType of a file transfer protocol-enabled server
       is AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE or API_Gateway , tests whether  your  identity
       provider is set up successfully. We highly recommend that you call this
       operation to test your authentication method as soon as you create your
       server.  By  doing  so,  you  can troubleshoot issues with the identity
       provider integration to ensure that your users can successfully use the
       service.

       The ServerId and UserName parameters are required. The ServerProtocol ,
       SourceIp , and UserPassword are all optional.

       NOTE:
          You cannot use TestIdentityProvider if the  IdentityProviderType  of
          your server is SERVICE_MANAGED .

       o If  you provide any incorrect values for any parameters, the Response
         field is empty.

       o If you provide a server ID for a  server  that  uses  service-managed
         users,  you  get  an error:   An error occurred (InvalidRequestExcep-
         tion) when calling the TestIdentityProvider operation:  s-*server-ID*
         not configured for external auth

       o If  you enter a Server ID for the --server-id parameter that does not
         identify an actual Transfer server, you receive the following  error:
         An error occurred (ResourceNotFoundException) when calling the TestI-
         dentityProvider operation: Unknown server

SYNOPSIS
            test-identity-provider
          --server-id <value>
          [--server-protocol <value>]
          [--source-ip <value>]
          --user-name <value>
          [--user-password <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --server-id (string)
          A system-assigned identifier for a specific  server.  That  server's
          user  authentication method is tested with a user name and password.

       --server-protocol (string)
          The type of file transfer protocol to be tested.

          The available protocols are:

          o Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)

          o File Transfer Protocol Secure (FTPS)

          o File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

          Possible values:

          o SFTP

          o FTP

          o FTPS

       --source-ip (string)
          The source IP address of the user account to be tested.

       --user-name (string)
          The name of the user account to be tested.

       --user-password (string)
          The password of the user account to be tested.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Response -> (string)
          The response that is returned from your API Gateway.

       StatusCode -> (integer)
          The HTTP status code that is the response from your API Gateway.

       Message -> (string)
          A message that indicates whether the test was successful or not.

       Url -> (string)
          The endpoint of the service used to authenticate a user.
