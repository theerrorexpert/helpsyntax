LIST-TAGS-FOR-RESOURCE()                              LIST-TAGS-FOR-RESOURCE()



NAME
       list-tags-for-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  of  the tags associated with the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
       that you specify. The resource can be a user, server, or role.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-tags-for-resource
          --arn <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          Requests the tags associated with a particular Amazon Resource  Name
          (ARN).  An  ARN  is an identifier for a specific Amazon Web Services
          resource, such as a server, user, or role.

       --max-results (integer)
          Specifies the number of tags to return as a response  to  the  List-
          TagsForResource request.

       --next-token (string)
          When  you  request  additional  results from the ListTagsForResource
          operation, a NextToken parameter is returned in the input.  You  can
          then pass in a subsequent command to the NextToken parameter to con-
          tinue listing additional tags.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The ARN you specified to list the tags of.

       NextToken -> (string)
          When you can get additional  results  from  the  ListTagsForResource
          call,  a NextToken parameter is returned in the output. You can then
          pass in a subsequent command to the NextToken parameter to  continue
          listing additional tags.

       Tags -> (list)
          Key-value  pairs  that  are  assigned to a resource, usually for the
          purpose of grouping and searching for items. Tags are metadata  that
          you define.

          (structure)
              Creates a key-value pair for a specific resource. Tags are meta-
              data that you can use to search for and  group  a  resource  for
              various  purposes.  You  can  apply  tags to servers, users, and
              roles. A tag key can take more than one value. For  example,  to
              group  servers  for  accounting purposes, you might create a tag
              called Group and assign the values Research  and  Accounting  to
              that group.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name assigned to the tag that you create.

              Value -> (string)
                 Contains one or more values that you assigned to the key name
                 you create.
