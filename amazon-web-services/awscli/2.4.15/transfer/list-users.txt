LIST-USERS()                                                      LIST-USERS()



NAME
       list-users -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  users  for a file transfer protocol-enabled server that you
       specify by passing the ServerId parameter.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-users
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          --server-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          Specifies the number of users to return as a response  to  the  Lis-
          tUsers request.

       --next-token (string)
          When you can get additional results from the ListUsers call, a Next-
          Token parameter is returned in the output. You can then  pass  in  a
          subsequent  command  to  the NextToken parameter to continue listing
          additional users.

       --server-id (string)
          A system-assigned unique identifier for  a  server  that  has  users
          assigned to it.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          When you can get additional results from the ListUsers call, a Next-
          Token parameter is returned in the output. You can then  pass  in  a
          subsequent  command  to  the NextToken parameter to continue listing
          additional users.

       ServerId -> (string)
          A system-assigned unique identifier for a server that the users  are
          assigned to.

       Users -> (list)
          Returns  the  user  accounts  and  their properties for the ServerId
          value that you specify.

          (structure)
              Returns properties of the user that you specify.

              Arn -> (string)
                 Provides the unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for  the  user
                 that you want to learn about.

              HomeDirectory -> (string)
                 The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to
                 the server using the client.

                 A HomeDirectory example is /bucket_name/home/mydirectory .

              HomeDirectoryType -> (string)
                 The type of landing directory (folder) you want  your  users'
                 home  directory  to  be when they log into the server. If you
                 set it to PATH , the user will see  the  absolute  Amazon  S3
                 bucket  or  EFS  paths  as is in their file transfer protocol
                 clients. If you set it LOGICAL , you need to provide mappings
                 in  the HomeDirectoryMappings for how you want to make Amazon
                 S3 or EFS paths visible to your users.

              Role -> (string)
                 Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that
                 controls  your  users' access to your Amazon S3 bucket or EFS
                 file system. The policies attached to this role determine the
                 level  of  access  that  you  want to provide your users when
                 transferring files into and out of your Amazon S3  bucket  or
                 EFS  file  system.  The  IAM role should also contain a trust
                 relationship that allows the server to access your  resources
                 when servicing your users' transfer requests.

                 NOTE:
                     The  IAM  role  that  controls your users' access to your
                     Amazon S3 bucket for servers with Domain=S3 , or your EFS
                     file system for servers with Domain=EFS .

                     The policies attached to this role determine the level of
                     access you want to provide your users  when  transferring
                     files  into  and  out of your S3 buckets or EFS file sys-
                     tems.

              SshPublicKeyCount -> (integer)
                 Specifies the number of SSH public keys stored for  the  user
                 you specified.

              UserName -> (string)
                 Specifies  the name of the user whose ARN was specified. User
                 names are used for authentication purposes.
