NAME
       describe-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       You  can use DescribeExecution to check the details of the execution of
       the specified workflow.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-execution
          --execution-id <value>
          --workflow-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --execution-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the execution of a workflow.

       --workflow-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the workflow.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       WorkflowId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the workflow.

       Execution -> (structure)
          The structure that contains the details of the workflow'  execution.

          ExecutionId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the execution of a workflow.

          InitialFileLocation -> (structure)
              A  structure  that describes the Amazon S3 or EFS file location.
              This is the file location when the execution begins: if the file
              is being copied, this is the initial (as opposed to destination)
              file location.

              S3FileLocation -> (structure)
                 Specifies the S3 details for the file  being  used,  such  as
                 bucket, Etag, and so forth.

                 Bucket -> (string)
                     Specifies  the  S3  bucket  that  contains the file being
                     used.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The name assigned to the file when it was created in  S3.

                 Etag -> (string)
                     The entity tag is a hash of the object. The ETag reflects
                     changes only to the contents of an object, not its  meta-
                     data.

              EfsFileLocation -> (structure)
                 Specifies  the  Amazon EFS ID and the path for the file being
                 used.

                     A unique string that identifies a user account associated
                     with a server.

                 ServerId -> (string)
                     The  system-assigned  unique  identifier  for  a Transfer
                     server instance.

                 SessionId -> (string)
                     The system-assigned unique identifier for a session  that

                 allows a server to turn on Amazon CloudWatch logging for Ama-
                 zon S3 or Amazon EFS events. When set, user activity  can  be
                 viewed in your CloudWatch logs.

              LogGroupName -> (string)
                 The  name  of the CloudWatch logging group for the Amazon Web
                 Services Transfer server to which this workflow belongs.

              The full POSIX identity, including user ID (Uid ), group ID (Gid
              ),  and any secondary groups IDs (SecondaryGids ), that controls

              ferring files into and out of your Amazon EFS file systems.
