LIST-SERVERS()                                                  LIST-SERVERS()



NAME
       list-servers -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  file  transfer protocol-enabled servers that are associated
       with your Amazon Web Services account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-servers is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the  results  of  the  following  query
       expressions: Servers

SYNOPSIS
            list-servers
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          When you can get additional results from the ListServers  operation,
          a NextToken parameter is returned in the output. In a following com-
          mand, you can pass in the NextToken parameter  to  continue  listing
          additional servers.

       Servers -> (list)
          An array of servers that were listed.

          (structure)
              Returns  properties  of  a file transfer protocol-enabled server
              that was specified.

              Arn -> (string)
                 Specifies the unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a  server
                 to be listed.

              Domain -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  domain of the storage system that is used for
                 file transfers.

              IdentityProviderType -> (string)
                 Specifies the  mode  of  authentication  for  a  server.  The
                 default  value is SERVICE_MANAGED , which allows you to store
                 and access user credentials within the  Amazon  Web  Services
                 Transfer Family service.

                 Use  AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE to provide access to Active Direc-
                 tory groups in Amazon Web Services Managed  Active  Directory
                 or Microsoft Active Directory in your on-premises environment
                 or in Amazon Web Services using AD  Connectors.  This  option
                 also requires you to provide a Directory ID using the Identi-
                 tyProviderDetails parameter.

                 Use the API_GATEWAY  value  to  integrate  with  an  identity
                 provider  of  your choosing. The API_GATEWAY setting requires
                 you to provide an  API  Gateway  endpoint  URL  to  call  for
                 authentication using the IdentityProviderDetails parameter.

                 Use the AWS_LAMBDA value to directly use a Lambda function as
                 your identity provider. If you choose this  value,  you  must
                 specify  the  ARN  for  the  lambda  function in the Function
                 parameter for the IdentityProviderDetails data type.

              EndpointType -> (string)
                 Specifies the type of VPC endpoint that your server  is  con-
                 nected  to.  If  your  server is connected to a VPC endpoint,
                 your server isn't accessible over the public internet.

              LoggingRole -> (string)
                 Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  Amazon  Web
                 Services  Identity  and  Access  Management  (IAM)  role that
                 allows a server to turn on Amazon CloudWatch logging for Ama-
                 zon  S3  or Amazon EFS events. When set, user activity can be
                 viewed in your CloudWatch logs.

              ServerId -> (string)
                 Specifies the  unique  system  assigned  identifier  for  the
                 servers that were listed.

              State -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  condition of a server for the server that was
                 described. A value of ONLINE indicates that  the  server  can
                 accept  jobs  and  transfer  files.  A State value of OFFLINE
                 means that the server cannot  perform  file  transfer  opera-
                 tions.

                 The  states of STARTING and STOPPING indicate that the server
                 is in  an  intermediate  state,  either  not  fully  able  to
                 respond,  or not fully offline. The values of START_FAILED or
                 STOP_FAILED can indicate an error condition.

              UserCount -> (integer)
                 Specifies the number of users that are assigned to  a  server
                 you specified with the ServerId .
