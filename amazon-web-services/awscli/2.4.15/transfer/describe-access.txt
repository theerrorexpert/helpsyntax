DESCRIBE-ACCESS()                                            DESCRIBE-ACCESS()



NAME
       describe-access -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  access  that  is assigned to the specific file transfer
       protocol-enabled server, as identified by its ServerId property and its
       ExternalID .

       The  response  from this call returns the properties of the access that
       is associated with the ServerId value that was specified.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-access
          --server-id <value>
          --external-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --server-id (string)
          A system-assigned unique identifier  for  a  server  that  has  this
          access assigned.

       --external-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier  that  is required to identify specific groups
          within your directory. The users of the  group  that  you  associate
          have  access  to  your  Amazon  S3  or Amazon EFS resources over the
          enabled protocols using Amazon Web Services Transfer Family. If  you
          know the group name, you can view the SID values by running the fol-
          lowing command using Windows PowerShell.
              Get-ADGroup -Filter {samAccountName -like  "*YourGroupName*  *"}
              -Properties * | Select SamAccountName,ObjectSid

          In  that command, replace YourGroupName with the name of your Active
          Directory group.

          The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of  characters
          consisting  of  uppercase and lowercase alphanumeric characters with
          no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the  following
          characters: =,.@:/-

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ServerId -> (string)
          A  system-assigned  unique  identifier  for  a  server that has this
          access assigned.

       Access -> (structure)
          The external ID of the server that the access is attached to.

          HomeDirectory -> (string)
              The landing directory (folder) for a user when they  log  in  to
              the server using the client.

              A HomeDirectory example is /bucket_name/home/mydirectory .

          HomeDirectoryMappings -> (list)
              Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon
              EFS paths and keys should be visible to your user  and  how  you
              want to make them visible. You must specify the Entry and Target
              pair, where Entry shows how the path is made visible and  Target
              is  the actual Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify
              a target, it is displayed as is. You also must ensure that  your
              Amazon  Web  Services  Identity and Access Management (IAM) role
              provides access to paths in Target . This value can only be  set
              when HomeDirectoryType is set to LOGICAL .

              In  most  cases,  you  can use this value instead of the session
              policy to lock down the associated access to the designated home
              directory  ("chroot "). To do this, you can set Entry to '/' and
              set Target to the HomeDirectory parameter value.

              (structure)
                 Represents an object that contains entries  and  targets  for
                 HomeDirectoryMappings .

                 The  following is an Entry and Target pair example for chroot
                 .
                     [ { "Entry:": "/", "Target":  "/bucket_name/home/mydirec-
                     tory" } ]

                 NOTE:
                     If the target of a logical directory entry does not exist
                     in Amazon S3 or EFS, the entry is  ignored.  As  a  work-
                     around,  you can use the Amazon S3 API or EFS API to cre-
                     ate 0 byte objects as place holders for  your  directory.
                     If using the CLI, use the s3api or efsapi call instead of
                     s3 or efs so you can use the  put-object  operation.  For
                     example,  you  use  the  following:  aws s3api put-object
                     --bucket bucketname --key  path/to/folder/  .  Make  sure
                     that  the  end  of  the key name ends in a / for it to be
                     considered a folder.

                 Entry -> (string)
                     Represents an entry for HomeDirectoryMappings .

                 Target -> (string)
                     Represents the map target that is used in a  HomeDirecto-
                     rymapEntry .

          HomeDirectoryType -> (string)
              The type of landing directory (folder) you want your users' home
              directory to be when they log into the server. If you set it  to
              PATH  ,  the  user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or EFS
              paths as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you  set
              it  LOGICAL  ,  you need to provide mappings in the HomeDirecto-
              ryMappings for how you want to make Amazon S3 or EFS paths visi-
              ble to your users.

          Policy -> (string)
              A  session policy for your user so that you can use the same IAM
              role across multiple users. This policy scopes down user  access
              to  portions  of  their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can
              use inside this policy include ${Transfer:UserName}  ,  ${Trans-
              fer:HomeDirectory} , and ${Transfer:HomeBucket} .

          PosixProfile -> (structure)
              The full POSIX identity, including user ID (Uid ), group ID (Gid
              ), and any secondary groups IDs (SecondaryGids ), that  controls
              your  users'  access  to your Amazon EFS file systems. The POSIX
              permissions that are set on files and directories in  your  file
              system  determine the level of access your users get when trans-
              ferring files into and out of your Amazon EFS file systems.

              Uid -> (long)
                 The POSIX user ID used for all EFS operations by this user.

              Gid -> (long)
                 The POSIX group ID used for all EFS operations by this  user.

              SecondaryGids -> (list)
                 The  secondary POSIX group IDs used for all EFS operations by
                 this user.

                 (long)

          Role -> (string)
              Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  IAM  role  that
              controls your users' access to your Amazon S3 bucket or EFS file
              system. The policies attached to this role determine  the  level
              of  access that you want to provide your users when transferring
              files into and out of your Amazon S3 bucket or EFS file  system.
              The  IAM  role  should  also  contain  a trust relationship that
              allows the server to access your resources when  servicing  your
              users' transfer requests.

          ExternalId -> (string)
              A unique identifier that is required to identify specific groups
              within your directory. The users of the group that you associate
              have  access  to your Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS resources over the
              enabled protocols using Amazon Web Services Transfer Family.  If
              you  know the group name, you can view the SID values by running
              the following command using Windows PowerShell.
                 Get-ADGroup -Filter  {samAccountName  -like  "*YourGroupName*
                 *"} -Properties * | Select SamAccountName,ObjectSid

              In  that  command,  replace  YourGroupName with the name of your
              Active Directory group.

              The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of charac-
              ters  consisting of uppercase and lowercase alphanumeric charac-
              ters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any  of
              the following characters: =,.@:/-
