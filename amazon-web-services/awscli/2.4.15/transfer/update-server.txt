OPTIONS
       --certificate (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web ServicesCertificate
          Manager  (ACM) certificate. Required when Protocols is set to FTPS .

          To request a new public certificate, see Request a  public  certifi-
          cate in the Amazon Web ServicesCertificate Manager User Guide .

          To  import  an existing certificate into ACM, see Importing certifi-
          cates into ACM in the Amazon Web  ServicesCertificate  Manager  User
          Guide .

          To  request  a  private  certificate  to use FTPS through private IP
          addresses, see Request a private certificate in the Amazon Web  Ser-
          vicesCertificate Manager User Guide .

          Certificates  with  the  following  cryptographic algorithms and key
          sizes are supported:

          o 2048-bit RSA (RSA_2048)

          o 4096-bit RSA (RSA_4096)

          o Elliptic Prime Curve 256 bit (EC_prime256v1)

          o Elliptic Prime Curve 384 bit (EC_secp384r1)

          o Elliptic Prime Curve 521 bit (EC_secp521r1)

          NOTE:
              The certificate must be a valid SSL/TLS X.509 version 3 certifi-
              cate with FQDN or IP address specified and information about the
              issuer.

       --protocol-details (structure)
          The protocol settings that are configured for your server.

          Use the PassiveIp parameter to indicate passive mode  (for  FTP  and
          FTPS  protocols).  Enter  a single dotted-quad IPv4 address, such as
          the external IP address of a firewall, router, or load balancer.

          Use the TlsSessionResumptionMode parameter to determine  whether  or
          not your Transfer server resumes recent, negotiated sessions through
          a unique session ID.

          PassiveIp -> (string)
              Indicates passive mode, for FTP and FTPS protocols. Enter a sin-
              gle dotted-quad IPv4 address, such as the external IP address of
              a firewall, router, or load balancer. For example:

                 ``
                 aws   transfer    update-server    --protocol-details    Pas-
                 siveIp=*0.0.0.0* ``

              Replace  ``  0.0.0.0  `` in the example above with the actual IP
              address you want to use.

              NOTE:
                 If you change the PassiveIp value, you  must  stop  and  then
                 restart  your  Transfer server for the change to take effect.
                 For details on using Passive IP (PASV) in a NAT  environment,
                 see  Configuring  your  FTPS  server behind a firewall or NAT
                 with Amazon Web Services Transfer Family .

          TlsSessionResumptionMode -> (string)
              A property used with Transfer servers that use the  FTPS  proto-
              col.  TLS  Session  Resumption provides a mechanism to resume or
              share a negotiated secret key between the control and data  con-
              nection for an FTPS session. TlsSessionResumptionMode determines
              whether or not the server resumes  recent,  negotiated  sessions
              through  a  unique session ID. This property is available during
              CreateServer and UpdateServer calls. If a  TlsSessionResumption-
              Mode  value  is  not specified during CreateServer, it is set to
              ENFORCED by default.

              o DISABLED : the server does not process TLS session  resumption
                client  requests  and  creates  a  new  TLS  session  for each
                request.

              o ENABLED : the server processes and accepts  clients  that  are
                performing  TLS  session resumption. The server doesn't reject
                client data connections that do not perform  the  TLS  session
                resumption client processing.

              o ENFORCED  :  the server processes and accepts clients that are
                performing TLS session resumption. The server  rejects  client
                data  connections  that do not perform the TLS session resump-
                tion client processing. Before you set the value to ENFORCED ,
                test your clients.

              NOTE:
                 Not  all  FTPS clients perform TLS session resumption. So, if
                 you choose to enforce TLS session resumption, you prevent any
                 connections from FTPS clients that don't perform the protocol
                 negotiation. To determine whether or  not  you  can  use  the
                 ENFORCED value, you need to test your clients.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          PassiveIp=string,TlsSessionResumptionMode=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "PassiveIp": "string",
            "TlsSessionResumptionMode": "DISABLED"|"ENABLED"|"ENFORCED"
          }

       --endpoint-details (structure)
          The  virtual  private cloud (VPC) endpoint settings that are config-
          ured for your server. When you host your endpoint within  your  VPC,
          you can make it accessible only to resources within your VPC, or you
          can attach Elastic IP addresses and make it  accessible  to  clients
          over  the internet. Your VPC's default security groups are automati-
          cally assigned to your endpoint.

          AddressAllocationIds -> (list)
              A list of address allocation IDs that are required to attach  an
              Elastic IP address to your server's endpoint.

              NOTE:
                 This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to VPC
                 and it is only valid in the UpdateServer API.

              (string)

          SubnetIds -> (list)
              A list of subnet IDs that are required to host your server  end-
              point in your VPC.

              NOTE:
                 This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to VPC
                 .

              (string)

          VpcEndpointId -> (string)
              The ID of the VPC endpoint.

              NOTE:
                 This property can only be set when  EndpointType  is  set  to
                 VPC_ENDPOINT .

                 For             more             information,             see
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/create-server-in-vpc.html#deprecate-vpc-endpoint.

          VpcId -> (string)
              The  VPC  ID  of  the  VPC  in which a server's endpoint will be
              hosted.

              NOTE:
                 This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to VPC
                 .

          SecurityGroupIds -> (list)
              A  list  of  security groups IDs that are available to attach to
              your server's endpoint.

              NOTE:
                 This property can only be set when EndpointType is set to VPC
                 .

                 You   can   edit   the   SecurityGroupIds   property  in  the
                 UpdateServer API only if you are  changing  the  EndpointType
                 from  PUBLIC  or  VPC_ENDPOINT  to  VPC  . To change security
                 groups associated with your server's VPC endpoint after  cre-
                 ation, use the Amazon EC2 ModifyVpcEndpoint API.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AddressAllocationIds=string,string,SubnetIds=string,string,VpcEndpointId=string,VpcId=string,SecurityGroupIds=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AddressAllocationIds": ["string", ...],
            "SubnetIds": ["string", ...],
            "VpcEndpointId": "string",
            "VpcId": "string",
            "SecurityGroupIds": ["string", ...]
          }

       --endpoint-type (string)
          The  type  of  endpoint  that  you  want your server to use. You can
          choose to make your server's endpoint publicly  accessible  (PUBLIC)
          or  host  it  inside  your VPC. With an endpoint that is hosted in a
          VPC, you can restrict access  to  your  server  and  resources  only
          within  your  VPC  or choose to make it internet facing by attaching
          Elastic IP addresses directly to it.

          NOTE:
              After May 19, 2021, you won't be able to create a  server  using
              EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT  in your Amazon Web Servicesaccount if
              your account hasn't already done so before May 19, 2021. If  you
              have  already  created servers with EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT in
              your Amazon Web Servicesaccount on or before May 19,  2021,  you
              will not be affected. After this date, use EndpointType =``VPC``
              .

              For              more              information,              see
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/create-server-in-vpc.html#deprecate-vpc-endpoint.

              It is recommended that you use VPC as the  EndpointType  .  With
              this endpoint type, you have the option to directly associate up
              to three Elastic IPv4 addresses  (BYO  IP  included)  with  your
              server's  endpoint and use VPC security groups to restrict traf-
              fic by the client's public IP address. This is not possible with
              EndpointType set to VPC_ENDPOINT .

          Possible values:

          o PUBLIC

          o VPC

          o VPC_ENDPOINT

       --host-key (string)
          The  RSA  private  key  as  generated  by ssh-keygen -N "" -m PEM -f
          my-new-server-key .

          WARNING:
              If you aren't planning to migrate existing users from an  exist-
              ing  server to a new server, don't update the host key. Acciden-
              tally changing a server's host key can be disruptive.

          For more information, see Change the host key for your  SFTP-enabled
          server in the Amazon Web ServicesTransfer Family User Guide .

       --identity-provider-details (structure)
          An  array  containing all of the information required to call a cus-
          tomer's authentication API method.

          Url -> (string)
              Provides the location of the service endpoint used to  authenti-
              cate users.

          InvocationRole -> (string)
              Provides  the  type  of  InvocationRole used to authenticate the
              user account.

          DirectoryId -> (string)
              The identifier of the  Amazon  Web  Services  Directory  Service
              directory that you want to stop sharing.

          Function -> (string)
              The  ARN for a lambda function to use for the Identity provider.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Url=string,InvocationRole=string,DirectoryId=string,Function=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Url": "string",
            "InvocationRole": "string",
            "DirectoryId": "string",
            "Function": "string"
          }

       --logging-role (string)
          Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web  Services
          Identity  and  Access  Management (IAM) role that allows a server to
          turn on Amazon CloudWatch  logging  for  Amazon  S3  or  Amazon  EFS
          events.  When  set,  user  activity can be viewed in your CloudWatch
          logs.

       --protocols (list)
          Specifies the file transfer protocol or protocols  over  which  your
          file transfer protocol client can connect to your server's endpoint.
          The available protocols are:

          o Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol  (SFTP):  File  transfer
            over SSH

          o File  Transfer  Protocol  Secure  (FTPS):  File  transfer with TLS
            encryption

          o File Transfer Protocol (FTP): Unencrypted file transfer

          NOTE:
              If you select FTPS , you must choose  a  certificate  stored  in
              Amazon  Web ServicesCertificate Manager (ACM) which will be used
              to identify your server when clients connect to it over FTPS.

              If Protocol includes either FTP or FTPS , then the  EndpointType
              must  be  VPC  and  the  IdentityProviderType must be AWS_DIREC-
              TORY_SERVICE or API_GATEWAY .

              If Protocol includes FTP , then AddressAllocationIds  cannot  be
              associated.

              If Protocol is set only to SFTP , the EndpointType can be set to
              PUBLIC and the IdentityProviderType can be set  to  SERVICE_MAN-
              AGED .

          (string)

            SFTP
            FTP
            FTPS

       --security-policy-name (string)
          Specifies  the  name  of the security policy that is attached to the
          server.

       --server-id (string)
          A system-assigned unique identifier for a server instance  that  the
          user account is assigned to.

       --workflow-details (structure)
          Specifies  the workflow ID for the workflow to assign and the execu-
          tion role used for executing the workflow.

          OnUpload -> (list)
              A trigger that starts a workflow: the workflow begins to execute
              after a file is uploaded.

              (structure)
                 Specifies  the workflow ID for the workflow to assign and the
                 execution role used for executing the workflow.

                 WorkflowId -> (string)
                     A unique identifier for the workflow.

                 ExecutionRole -> (string)
                     Includes the  necessary  permissions  for  S3,  EFS,  and
                     Lambda  operations  that Transfer can assume, so that all
                     workflow steps can operate on the required resources

       Shorthand Syntax:

          OnUpload=[{WorkflowId=string,ExecutionRole=string},{WorkflowId=string,ExecutionRole=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "OnUpload": [
              {

              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ServerId -> (string)
          A system-assigned unique identifier  for  a  server  that  the  user
          account is assigned to.
