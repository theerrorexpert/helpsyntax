STOP-SERVER()                                                    STOP-SERVER()



NAME
       stop-server -

DESCRIPTION
       Changes  the  state  of  a  file  transfer protocol-enabled server from
       ONLINE to OFFLINE . An OFFLINE server cannot accept  and  process  file
       transfer jobs. Information tied to your server, such as server and user
       properties, are not affected by stopping your server.

       NOTE:
          Stopping the server will not reduce or  impact  your  file  transfer
          protocol  endpoint billing; you must delete the server to stop being
          billed.

       The state of STOPPING indicates that the server is in  an  intermediate
       state, either not fully able to respond, or not fully offline. The val-
       ues of STOP_FAILED can indicate an error condition.

       No response is returned from this call.

SYNOPSIS
            stop-server
          --server-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --server-id (string)
          A system-assigned unique identifier for a server that you stopped.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
