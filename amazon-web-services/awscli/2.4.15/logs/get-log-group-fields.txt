GET-LOG-GROUP-FIELDS()                                  GET-LOG-GROUP-FIELDS()



NAME
       get-log-group-fields -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of  the fields that are included in log events in the
       specified log group, along with the percentage of log events that  con-
       tain  each field. The search is limited to a time period that you spec-
       ify.

       In the results, fields that start with @ are fields generated by Cloud-
       Watch Logs. For example, @timestamp is the timestamp of each log event.
       For more information about the fields that are generated by  CloudWatch
       logs, see Supported Logs and Discovered Fields .

       The  response  results are sorted by the frequency percentage, starting
       with the highest percentage.

SYNOPSIS
            get-log-group-fields
          --log-group-name <value>
          [--time <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --log-group-name (string)
          The name of the log group to search.

       --time (long)
          The time to set as the center of the query. If you  specify  time  ,
          the  15 minutes before this time are queries. If you omit time the 8
          minutes before and 8 minutes after this time are searched.

          The time value is specified as epoch time,  the  number  of  seconds
          since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       logGroupFields -> (list)
          The  array  of  fields  found in the query. Each object in the array
          contains the name of the field, along with the percentage of time it
          appeared in the log events that were queried.

          (structure)
              The  fields contained in log events found by a GetLogGroupFields
              operation, along with the percentage of queried  log  events  in
              which each field appears.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of a log field.

              percent -> (integer)
                 The  percentage  of  log  events  queried  that contained the
                 field.
