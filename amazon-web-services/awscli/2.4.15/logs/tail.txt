NAME
       tail -

DESCRIPTION
       Tails  the  logs  for  a CloudWatch Logs group. By default, the command
       returns logs from all associated CloudWatch  Logs  streams  during  the
       past  ten  minutes. Note that there is no guarantee for exact timestamp
       ordering of logs.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            tail
          group_name <value>
          [--since <value>]
          [--follow]
          [--format <value>]
          [--filter-pattern <value>]
          [--log-stream-names <value> [<value>...]]
          [--log-stream-name-prefix <value>]

OPTIONS
       group_name (string) The name of the CloudWatch Logs group.

       --since (string) From what time to begin displaying logs.  By  default,
       logs will be displayed starting from ten minutes in the past. The value
       provided can be an ISO 8601 timestamp or a relative time. For  relative
       times, provide a number and a single unit. Supported units include:

          o s - seconds

          o m - minutes

          o h - hours

          o d - days

          o w - weeks

          For  example,  a value of 5m would indicate to display logs starting
          five minutes in the past. Note that multiple units are not supported
          (i.e. 5h30m)

       --follow  (boolean)  Whether  to  continuously  poll  for  new logs. By
       default, the command will exit once there are no more logs to  display.
       To exit from this mode, use Control-C.

       --format (string) The format to display the logs. The following formats
       are supported:

          o detailed - This the default format. It prints  out  the  timestamp
            with millisecond precision and timezones, the log stream name, and
            the log message.

          o short - A shortened format. It prints out the  a  shortened  time-
            stamp and the log message.

          o json - Pretty print any messages that are entirely JSON.

       --filter-pattern  (string)  The  filter  pattern to use. See Filter and
       Pattern Syntax for details. If not provided, all the events are matched

       --log-stream-names (string) The list of stream names to filter logs by.
       This parameter cannot be  specified  when  --log-stream-name-prefix  is
       also specified.

       --log-stream-name-prefix  (string)  The  prefix to filter logs by. Only
       events from log streams with names beginning with this prefix  will  be
       returned.  This  parameter cannot be specified when log-stream-names is
       also specified.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
