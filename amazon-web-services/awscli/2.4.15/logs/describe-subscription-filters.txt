DESCRIBE-SUBSCRIPTION-FILTERS()                DESCRIBE-SUBSCRIPTION-FILTERS()



NAME
       describe-subscription-filters -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  subscription  filters  for the specified log group. You can
       list all the subscription filters or filter the results by prefix.  The
       results are ASCII-sorted by filter name.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-subscription-filters  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: subscriptionFilters

SYNOPSIS
            describe-subscription-filters
          --log-group-name <value>
          [--filter-name-prefix <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --log-group-name (string)
          The name of the log group.

       --filter-name-prefix (string)
          The prefix to match. If you don't specify a value, no prefix  filter
          is applied.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       subscriptionFilters -> (list)
          The subscription filters.

          (structure)
              Represents a subscription filter.

              filterName -> (string)
                 The name of the subscription filter.

              logGroupName -> (string)
                 The name of the log group.

              filterPattern -> (string)
                 A symbolic description of how CloudWatch Logs  should  inter-
                 pret the data in each log event. For example, a log event can
                 contain timestamps, IP addresses, strings, and so on. You use
                 the  filter  pattern  to  specify what to look for in the log
                 event message.

              destinationArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the destination.

              roleArn -> (string)

              distribution -> (string)
                 The method used to distribute log data  to  the  destination,
                 which can be either random or grouped by log stream.

              creationTime -> (long)
                 The  creation  time  of the subscription filter, expressed as
                 the number of milliseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of items to  return.  The  token  expires
          after 24 hours.
