START-QUERY()                                                    START-QUERY()



NAME
       start-query -

DESCRIPTION
       Schedules  a  query  of a log group using CloudWatch Logs Insights. You
       specify the log group and time range to query and the query  string  to
       use.

       For more information, see CloudWatch Logs Insights Query Syntax .

       Queries  time  out  after  15 minutes of execution. If your queries are
       timing out, reduce the time range  being  searched  or  partition  your
       query into a number of queries.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-query
          [--log-group-name <value>]
          [--log-group-names <value>]
          --start-time <value>
          --end-time <value>
          --query-string <value>
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --log-group-name (string)
          The log group on which to perform the query.

          A  StartQuery  operation must include a logGroupNames or a logGroup-
          Name parameter, but not both.

       --log-group-names (list)
          The list of log groups to be queried. You can include up to  20  log
          groups.

          A  StartQuery  operation must include a logGroupNames or a logGroup-
          Name parameter, but not both.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --start-time (long)
          The beginning of the time range to query. The range is inclusive, so
          the  specified  start  time  is  included in the query. Specified as
          epoch time, the number of seconds since January  1,  1970,  00:00:00
          UTC.

       --end-time (long)
          The  end  of the time range to query. The range is inclusive, so the
          specified end time is included in  the  query.  Specified  as  epoch
          time, the number of seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC.

       --query-string (string)
          The  query  string to use. For more information, see CloudWatch Logs
          Insights Query Syntax .

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of log events to return  in  the  query.  If  the
          query  string uses the fields command, only the specified fields and
          their values are returned. The default is 1000.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       queryId -> (string)
          The unique ID of the query.
