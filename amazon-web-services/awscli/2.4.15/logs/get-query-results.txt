GET-QUERY-RESULTS()                                        GET-QUERY-RESULTS()



NAME
       get-query-results -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the results from the specified query.

       Only  the fields requested in the query are returned, along with a @ptr
       field, which is the identifier for the log  record.  You  can  use  the
       value of @ptr in a GetLogRecord operation to get the full log record.
          GetQueryResults  does  not  start a query execution. To run a query,
          use StartQuery .

       If the value of the Status field in the output is Running , this opera-
       tion  returns  only partial results. If you see a value of Scheduled or
       Running for the status, you can retry the operation later  to  see  the
       final results.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-query-results
          --query-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --query-id (string)
          The ID number of the query.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       results -> (list)
          The  log  events  that  matched  the  query criteria during the most
          recent time it ran.

          The results value is an array of  arrays.  Each  log  event  is  one
          object in the top-level array. Each of these log event objects is an
          array of field /value pairs.

          (list)
              (structure)
                 Contains one field from one log event returned  by  a  Cloud-
                 Watch  Logs  Insights  query,  along  with  the value of that
                 field.

                 For more information about the fields that are  generated  by
                 CloudWatch logs, see Supported Logs and Discovered Fields .

                 field -> (string)
                     The log event field.

                 value -> (string)
                     The value of this field.

       statistics -> (structure)
          Includes  the  number of log events scanned by the query, the number
          of log events that matched the query criteria, and the total  number
          of  bytes  in the log events that were scanned. These values reflect
          the full raw results of the query.

          recordsMatched -> (double)
              The number of log events that matched the query string.

          recordsScanned -> (double)
              The total number of log events scanned during the query.

          bytesScanned -> (double)
              The total number of bytes in the log events scanned  during  the
              query.

       status -> (string)
          The  status of the most recent running of the query. Possible values
          are Cancelled , Complete , Failed , Running , Scheduled , Timeout  ,
          and Unknown .

          Queries time out after 15 minutes of execution. To avoid having your
          queries time out, reduce the time range being searched or  partition
          your query into a number of queries.
