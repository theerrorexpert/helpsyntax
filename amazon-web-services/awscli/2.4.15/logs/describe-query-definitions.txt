DESCRIBE-QUERY-DEFINITIONS()                      DESCRIBE-QUERY-DEFINITIONS()



NAME
       describe-query-definitions -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  returns a paginated list of your saved CloudWatch Logs
       Insights query definitions.

       You can  use  the  queryDefinitionNamePrefix  parameter  to  limit  the
       results to only the query definitions that have names that start with a
       certain string.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-query-definitions
          [--query-definition-name-prefix <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --query-definition-name-prefix (string)
          Use this parameter to filter your results to only the query  defini-
          tions that have names that start with the prefix you specify.

       --max-results (integer)
          Limits  the  number  of  returned query definitions to the specified
          number.

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next set of items to  return.  The  token  expires
          after 24 hours.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       queryDefinitions -> (list)
          The list of query definitions that match your request.

          (structure)
              This  structure  contains  details about a saved CloudWatch Logs
              Insights query definition.

              queryDefinitionId -> (string)
                 The unique ID of the query definition.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the query definition.

              queryString -> (string)
                 The query string to use for this definition. For more  infor-
                 mation, see CloudWatch Logs Insights Query Syntax .

              lastModified -> (long)
                 The  date  that  the query definition was most recently modi-
                 fied.

              logGroupNames -> (list)
                 If this query definition contains a list of log  groups  that
                 it is limited to, that list appears here.

                 (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  token  for  the  next set of items to return. The token expires
          after 24 hours.
