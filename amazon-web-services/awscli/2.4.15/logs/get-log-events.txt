GET-LOG-EVENTS()                                              GET-LOG-EVENTS()



NAME
       get-log-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists log events from the specified log stream. You can list all of the
       log events or filter using a time range.

       By default, this operation returns as many log events as can fit  in  a
       response  size of 1MB (up to 10,000 log events). You can get additional
       log events by specifying one of the tokens in a subsequent  call.  This
       operation  can  return  empty  results  while there are more log events
       available through the token.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-log-events
          --log-group-name <value>
          --log-stream-name <value>
          [--start-time <value>]
          [--end-time <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--start-from-head | --no-start-from-head]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --log-group-name (string)
          The name of the log group.

       --log-stream-name (string)
          The name of the log stream.

       --start-time (long)
          The start of the time range, expressed as the number of milliseconds
          after  Jan  1,  1970  00:00:00 UTC. Events with a timestamp equal to
          this time or later than this time are included. Events with a  time-
          stamp earlier than this time are not included.

       --end-time (long)
          The  end  of the time range, expressed as the number of milliseconds
          after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC. Events with a timestamp equal to  or
          later than this time are not included.

       --next-token (string)
          The  token  for  the next set of items to return. (You received this
          token from a previous call.)

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of log events returned. If you  don't  specify  a
          value,  the  maximum  is as many log events as can fit in a response
          size of 1 MB, up to 10,000 log events.

       --start-from-head | --no-start-from-head (boolean)
          If the value is true, the earliest log events are returned first. If
          the  value  is  false, the latest log events are returned first. The
          default value is false.

          If you are using a previous nextForwardToken value as the  nextToken
          in this operation, you must specify true for startFromHead .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  command  retrieves  log  events from a log stream named
       20150601 in the log group my-logs:

          aws logs get-log-events --log-group-name my-logs --log-stream-name 20150601

       Output:

OUTPUT
       events -> (list)
          The events.

          (structure)
              Represents a log event.

              timestamp -> (long)
                 The time the event occurred, expressed as the number of  mil-
                 liseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.

              message -> (string)
                 The data contained in the log event.

              ingestionTime -> (long)
                 The  time  the event was ingested, expressed as the number of
                 milliseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.

       nextForwardToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of items in the  forward  direction.  The
          token  expires  after  24  hours. If you have reached the end of the
          stream, it returns the same token you passed in.

       nextBackwardToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of items in the backward  direction.  The
          token  expires after 24 hours. This token is never null. If you have
          reached the end of the stream, it returns the same token you  passed
          in.
