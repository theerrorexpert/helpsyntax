PUT-METRIC-FILTER()                                        PUT-METRIC-FILTER()



NAME
       put-metric-filter -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates or updates a metric filter and associates it with the specified
       log group. Metric filters allow you to configure rules to extract  met-
       ric data from log events ingested through PutLogEvents .

       The  maximum number of metric filters that can be associated with a log
       group is 100.

       When you create a metric filter, you can also optionally assign a  unit
       and dimensions to the metric that is created.

       WARNING:
          Metrics  extracted from log events are charged as custom metrics. To
          prevent unexpected high charges,  do  not  specify  high-cardinality
          fields  such as IPAddress or requestID as dimensions. Each different
          value found for a dimension is treated  as  a  separate  metric  and
          accrues charges as a separate custom metric.

          To  help  prevent  accidental high charges, Amazon disables a metric
          filter if it generates  1000  different  name/value  pairs  for  the
          dimensions  that you have specified within a certain amount of time.

          You can also set up a billing alarm to alert you if your charges are
          higher  than  expected. For more information, see Creating a Billing
          Alarm to Monitor Your Estimated Amazon Web Services Charges .

SYNOPSIS
            put-metric-filter
          --log-group-name <value>
          --filter-name <value>
          --filter-pattern <value>
          --metric-transformations <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --log-group-name (string)
          The name of the log group.

       --filter-name (string)
          A name for the metric filter.

       --filter-pattern (string)
          A filter pattern for extracting metric  data  out  of  ingested  log
          events.

       --metric-transformations (list)
          A  collection of information that defines how metric data gets emit-
          ted.

          (structure)
              Indicates how to transform ingested log events to metric data in
              a CloudWatch metric.

              metricName -> (string)
                 The name of the CloudWatch metric.

              metricNamespace -> (string)
                 A  custom namespace to contain your metric in CloudWatch. Use
                 namespaces to group together metrics that  are  similar.  For
                 more information, see Namespaces .

              metricValue -> (string)
                 The  value  to publish to the CloudWatch metric when a filter
                 pattern matches a log event.

              defaultValue -> (double)
                 (Optional) The value to emit when a filter pattern  does  not
                 match a log event. This value can be null.

              dimensions -> (map)
                 The  fields  to  use as dimensions for the metric. One metric
                 filter can include as many as three dimensions.

                 WARNING:
                     Metrics extracted from log events are charged  as  custom
                     metrics. To prevent unexpected high charges, do not spec-
                     ify  high-cardinality  fields  such   as   IPAddress   or
                     requestID as dimensions. Each different value found for a
                     dimension is treated as a  separate  metric  and  accrues
                     charges as a separate custom metric.

                     To  help prevent accidental high charges, Amazon disables
                     a metric filter if it generates 1000 different name/value
                     pairs for the dimensions that you have specified within a
                     certain amount of time.

                     You can also set up a billing alarm to alert you if  your
                     charges  are  higher than expected. For more information,
                     see Creating a Billing Alarm to  Monitor  Your  Estimated
                     Amazon Web Services Charges .

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              unit -> (string)
                 The  unit to assign to the metric. If you omit this, the unit
                 is set as None .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          metricName=string,metricNamespace=string,metricValue=string,defaultValue=double,dimensions={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string},unit=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "metricName": "string",
              "metricNamespace": "string",
              "metricValue": "string",
              "defaultValue": double,
              "dimensions": {"string": "string"
                ...},
              "unit": "Seconds"|"Microseconds"|"Milliseconds"|"Bytes"|"Kilobytes"|"Megabytes"|"Gigabytes"|"Terabytes"|"Bits"|"Kilobits"|"Megabits"|"Gigabits"|"Terabits"|"Percent"|"Count"|"Bytes/Second"|"Kilobytes/Second"|"Megabytes/Second"|"Gigabytes/Second"|"Terabytes/Second"|"Bits/Second"|"Kilobits/Second"|"Megabits/Second"|"Gigabits/Second"|"Terabits/Second"|"Count/Second"|"None"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
