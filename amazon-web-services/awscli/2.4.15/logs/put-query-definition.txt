PUT-QUERY-DEFINITION()                                  PUT-QUERY-DEFINITION()



NAME
       put-query-definition -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates or updates a query definition for CloudWatch Logs Insights. For
       more information, see Analyzing Log Data with CloudWatch Logs  Insights
       .

       To  update  a  query  definition, specify its queryDefinitionId in your
       request. The values of name  ,  queryString  ,  and  logGroupNames  are
       changed  to  the  values  that you specify in your update operation. No
       current values are retained from  the  current  query  definition.  For
       example,  if  you  update  a current query definition that includes log
       groups, and you don't  specify  the  logGroupNames  parameter  in  your
       update  operation,  the  query  definition  changes  to  contain no log
       groups.

       You must have the logs:PutQueryDefinition permission to be able to per-
       form this operation.

SYNOPSIS
            put-query-definition
          --name <value>
          [--query-definition-id <value>]
          [--log-group-names <value>]
          --query-string <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          A  name  for  the query definition. If you are saving a lot of query
          definitions, we recommend that you name them so that you can  easily
          find the ones you want by using the first part of the name as a fil-
          ter    in     the     queryDefinitionNamePrefix     parameter     of
          DescribeQueryDefinitions .

       --query-definition-id (string)
          If  you are updating a query definition, use this parameter to spec-
          ify the ID of the query definition that you want to update. You  can
          use DescribeQueryDefinitions to retrieve the IDs of your saved query
          definitions.

          If you are creating a query definition, do not specify this  parame-
          ter.  CloudWatch  generates a unique ID for the new query definition
          and include it in the response to this operation.

       --log-group-names (list)
          Use this parameter to include specific log groups as  part  of  your
          query definition.

          If  you are updating a query definition and you omit this parameter,
          then the updated definition will contain no log groups.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --query-string (string)
          The query string to use for this definition. For  more  information,
          see CloudWatch Logs Insights Query Syntax .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       queryDefinitionId -> (string)
          The ID of the query definition.
