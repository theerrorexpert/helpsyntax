DESCRIBE-LOG-GROUPS()                                    DESCRIBE-LOG-GROUPS()



NAME
       describe-log-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  specified  log  groups. You can list all your log groups or
       filter the results by prefix. The results are ASCII-sorted by log group
       name.

       CloudWatch  Logs doesnt support IAM policies that control access to the
       DescribeLogGroups action by using the
       ``
       aws:ResourceTag/key-name  ``  condition  key.  Other  CloudWatch   Logs
       actions do support the use of the
       ``
       aws:ResourceTag/key-name  ``  condition key to control access. For more
       information about using tags to control access, see Controlling  access
       to Amazon Web Services resources using tags .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-log-groups is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: logGroups

SYNOPSIS
            describe-log-groups
          [--log-group-name-prefix <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --log-group-name-prefix (string)
          The prefix to match.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command describes a log group named my-logs:

          aws logs describe-log-groups --log-group-name-prefix my-logs

       Output:

          {
              "logGroups": [
                  {
                      "storedBytes": 0,
                      "metricFilterCount": 0,
                      "creationTime": 1433189500783,
                      "logGroupName": "my-logs",
                      "retentionInDays": 5,
                      "arn": "arn:aws:logs:us-west-2:0123456789012:log-group:my-logs:*"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       logGroups -> (list)
          The log groups.

          If  the  retentionInDays value if not included for a log group, then
          that log group is set to have its events never expire.

          (structure)
              Represents a log group.

              logGroupName -> (string)
                 The name of the log group.

              creationTime -> (long)
                 The creation time of the log group, expressed as  the  number
                 of milliseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.

              retentionInDays -> (integer)
                 The  number of days to retain the log events in the specified
                 log group. Possible values are: 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 30,  60,  90,
                 120, 150, 180, 365, 400, 545, 731, 1827, and 3653.

                 To  set  a  log  group  to  never have log events expire, use
                 DeleteRetentionPolicy .

              metricFilterCount -> (integer)
                 The number of metric filters.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the log group.

              storedBytes -> (long)
                 The number of bytes stored.

              kmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the  CMK  to  use  when
                 encrypting log data.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  token  for  the  next set of items to return. The token expires
          after 24 hours.
