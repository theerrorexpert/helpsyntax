CREATE-LOG-STREAM()                                        CREATE-LOG-STREAM()



NAME
       create-log-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  log  stream  for the specified log group. A log stream is a
       sequence of log events that originate from a single source, such as  an
       application instance or a resource that is being monitored.

       There  is no limit on the number of log streams that you can create for
       a log group. There is a limit of 50 TPS on CreateLogStream  operations,
       after which transactions are throttled.

       You must use the following guidelines when naming a log stream:

       o Log stream names must be unique within the log group.

       o Log stream names can be between 1 and 512 characters long.

       o The ':' (colon) and '*' (asterisk) characters are not allowed.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-log-stream
          --log-group-name <value>
          --log-stream-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --log-group-name (string)
          The name of the log group.

       --log-stream-name (string)
          The name of the log stream.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  command  creates a log stream named 20150601 in the log
       group my-logs:

          aws logs create-log-stream --log-group-name my-logs --log-stream-name 20150601

OUTPUT
       None
