PUT-SUBSCRIPTION-FILTER()                            PUT-SUBSCRIPTION-FILTER()



NAME
       put-subscription-filter -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  or  updates  a  subscription filter and associates it with the
       specified log group. Subscription filters allow you to subscribe  to  a
       real-time  stream  of log events ingested through PutLogEvents and have
       them delivered to a specific destination. When log events are  sent  to
       the  receiving service, they are Base64 encoded and compressed with the
       gzip format.

       The following destinations are supported for subscription filters:

       o An Amazon Kinesis stream belonging to the same account  as  the  sub-
         scription filter, for same-account delivery.

       o A  logical  destination  that  belongs  to  a  different account, for
         cross-account delivery.

       o An Amazon Kinesis Firehose delivery stream that belongs to  the  same
         account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.

       o An  Lambda function that belongs to the same account as the subscrip-
         tion filter, for same-account delivery.

       Each log group can have up to two subscription filters associated  with
       it.  If  you are updating an existing filter, you must specify the cor-
       rect name in filterName .

       To perform a PutSubscriptionFilter operation, you must  also  have  the
       iam:PassRole permission.

SYNOPSIS
            put-subscription-filter
          --log-group-name <value>
          --filter-name <value>
          --filter-pattern <value>
          --destination-arn <value>
          [--role-arn <value>]
          [--distribution <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --log-group-name (string)
          The name of the log group.

       --filter-name (string)
          A  name for the subscription filter. If you are updating an existing
          filter, you must specify the correct name in filterName  .  To  find
          the  name  of  the filter currently associated with a log group, use
          DescribeSubscriptionFilters .

       --filter-pattern (string)
          A filter pattern for subscribing to a filtered stream of log events.

       --destination-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of the destination to deliver matching log events to. Cur-
          rently, the supported destinations are:

          o An Amazon Kinesis stream belonging to the same account as the sub-
            scription filter, for same-account delivery.

          o A logical destination (specified using an ARN) belonging to a dif-
            ferent account, for cross-account delivery. If you are setting  up
            a  cross-account  subscription,  the  destination must have an IAM
            policy associated with it that allows the sender to send  logs  to
            the  destination. For more information, see PutDestinationPolicy .

          o An Amazon Kinesis Firehose delivery stream belonging to  the  same
            account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.

          o A  Lambda  function belonging to the same account as the subscrip-
            tion filter, for same-account delivery.

       --role-arn (string)
          The ARN of an IAM role that grants CloudWatch  Logs  permissions  to
          deliver  ingested  log  events  to the destination stream. You don't
          need to provide the ARN when you are working with a logical destina-
          tion for cross-account delivery.

       --distribution (string)
          The  method  used  to  distribute  log  data  to the destination. By
          default, log data is grouped by log stream, but the grouping can  be
          set  to  random  for a more even distribution. This property is only
          applicable when the destination is an Amazon Kinesis stream.

          Possible values:

          o Random

          o ByLogStream

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
