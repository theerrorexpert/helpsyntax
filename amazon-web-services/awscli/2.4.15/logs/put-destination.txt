PUT-DESTINATION()                                            PUT-DESTINATION()



NAME
       put-destination -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates or updates a destination. This operation is used only to create
       destinations for cross-account subscriptions.

       A destination encapsulates a physical resource (such as an Amazon Kine-
       sis  stream)  and enables you to subscribe to a real-time stream of log
       events for a different account, ingested using PutLogEvents .

       Through an access policy, a destination controls what is written to it.
       By default, PutDestination does not set any access policy with the des-
       tination,   which   means   a   cross-account    user    cannot    call
       PutSubscriptionFilter  against  this  destination.  To enable this, the
       destination owner must call PutDestinationPolicy after PutDestination .

       To perform a PutDestination operation, you must also have the iam:Pass-
       Role permission.

SYNOPSIS
            put-destination
          --destination-name <value>
          --target-arn <value>
          --role-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --destination-name (string)
          A name for the destination.

       --target-arn (string)
          The ARN of an Amazon Kinesis stream to which to deliver matching log
          events.

       --role-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of  an IAM role that grants CloudWatch Logs permissions to
          call the Amazon  Kinesis  PutRecord  operation  on  the  destination
          stream.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       destination -> (structure)

          targetArn -> (string)

          roleArn -> (string)
              A role for impersonation, used when delivering log events to the
              target.

          accessPolicy -> (string)
              An  IAM  policy  document that governs which Amazon Web Services

              tion.
