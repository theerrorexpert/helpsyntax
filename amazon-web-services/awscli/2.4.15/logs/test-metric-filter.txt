TEST-METRIC-FILTER()                                      TEST-METRIC-FILTER()



NAME
       test-metric-filter -

DESCRIPTION
       Tests  the  filter  pattern  of a metric filter against a sample of log
       event messages. You can use this operation to validate the  correctness
       of a metric filter pattern.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            test-metric-filter
          --filter-pattern <value>
          --log-event-messages <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filter-pattern (string)
          A  symbolic  description of how CloudWatch Logs should interpret the
          data in each log event. For example, a log event can  contain  time-
          stamps, IP addresses, strings, and so on. You use the filter pattern
          to specify what to look for in the log event message.

       --log-event-messages (list)
          The log event messages to test.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       matches -> (list)
          The matched events.

          (structure)
              Represents a matched event.

              eventNumber -> (long)
                 The event number.

              eventMessage -> (string)
                 The raw event data.

              extractedValues -> (map)
                 The values extracted from the event data by the filter.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)
