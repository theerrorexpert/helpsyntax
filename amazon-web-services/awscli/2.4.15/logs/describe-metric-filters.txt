DESCRIBE-METRIC-FILTERS()                            DESCRIBE-METRIC-FILTERS()



NAME
       describe-metric-filters -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the specified metric filters. You can list all of the metric fil-
       ters or filter the results by log name, prefix, metric name, or  metric
       namespace. The results are ASCII-sorted by filter name.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-metric-filters  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: metricFilters

SYNOPSIS
            describe-metric-filters
          [--log-group-name <value>]
          [--filter-name-prefix <value>]
          [--metric-name <value>]
          [--metric-namespace <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --log-group-name (string)
          The name of the log group.

       --filter-name-prefix (string)
          The prefix to match. CloudWatch Logs uses the  value  you  set  here
          only if you also include the logGroupName parameter in your request.

       --metric-name (string)
          Filters results to include only  those  with  the  specified  metric
          name.  If  you include this parameter in your request, you must also
          include the metricNamespace parameter.

       --metric-namespace (string)
          Filters results to include only those in the specified namespace. If
          you  include  this  parameter in your request, you must also include
          the metricName parameter.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       metricFilters -> (list)
          The metric filters.

          (structure)
              Metric  filters express how CloudWatch Logs would extract metric
              observations from ingested log events and  transform  them  into
              metric data in a CloudWatch metric.

              filterName -> (string)
                 The name of the metric filter.

              filterPattern -> (string)
                 A  symbolic  description of how CloudWatch Logs should inter-
                 pret the data in each log event. For example, a log event can
                 contain timestamps, IP addresses, strings, and so on. You use
                 the filter pattern to specify what to look  for  in  the  log
                 event message.

              metricTransformations -> (list)
                 The metric transformations.

                 (structure)
                     Indicates  how to transform ingested log events to metric
                     data in a CloudWatch metric.

                     metricName -> (string)
                        The name of the CloudWatch metric.

                     metricNamespace -> (string)
                        A custom namespace to contain your  metric  in  Cloud-
                        Watch.  Use  namespaces to group together metrics that
                        are similar. For more information, see Namespaces .

                     metricValue -> (string)
                        The value to publish to the CloudWatch metric  when  a
                        filter pattern matches a log event.

                     defaultValue -> (double)
                        (Optional)  The  value  to  emit when a filter pattern
                        does not match a log event. This value can be null.

                     dimensions -> (map)
                        The fields to use as dimensions for  the  metric.  One
                        metric filter can include as many as three dimensions.

                        WARNING:
                            Metrics extracted from log events are  charged  as
                            custom   metrics.   To   prevent  unexpected  high
                            charges, do not  specify  high-cardinality  fields
                            such as IPAddress or requestID as dimensions. Each
                            different value found for a dimension  is  treated
                            as a separate metric and accrues charges as a sep-
                            arate custom metric.

                            To help prevent accidental  high  charges,  Amazon
                            disables a metric filter if it generates 1000 dif-
                            ferent name/value pairs for  the  dimensions  that
                            you  have  specified  within  a  certain amount of
                            time.

                            You can also set up a billing alarm to  alert  you
                            if your charges are higher than expected. For more
                            information, see Creating a Billing Alarm to Moni-
                            tor Your Estimated Amazon Web Services Charges .

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (string)

                     unit -> (string)
                        The  unit  to  assign to the metric. If you omit this,
                        the unit is set as None .

              creationTime -> (long)
                 The creation time of the metric filter, expressed as the num-
                 ber of milliseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.

              logGroupName -> (string)
                 The name of the log group.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  token  for  the  next set of items to return. The token expires
          after 24 hours.
