CREATE-LOG-GROUP()                                          CREATE-LOG-GROUP()



NAME
       create-log-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  log  group  with  the  specified name. You can create up to
       20,000 log groups per account.

       You must use the following guidelines when naming a log group:

       o Log group names must be unique within a region for an Amazon Web Ser-
         vices account.

       o Log group names can be between 1 and 512 characters long.

       o Log  group  names consist of the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9,
         '_' (underscore), '-' (hyphen), '/' (forward  slash),  '.'  (period),
         and '#' (number sign)

       When you create a log group, by default the log events in the log group
       never expire. To set a retention policy so that events expire  and  are
       deleted after a specified time, use PutRetentionPolicy .

       If  you  associate  a  Key Management Service customer master key (CMK)
       with the log group, ingested data is  encrypted  using  the  CMK.  This
       association  is  stored  as  long as the data encrypted with the CMK is
       still within CloudWatch Logs. This enables CloudWatch Logs  to  decrypt
       this data whenever it is requested.

       If  you  attempt to associate a CMK with the log group but the CMK does
       not exist or the CMK is disabled, you receive an InvalidParameterExcep-
       tion error.

       WARNING:
          CloudWatch  Logs  supports  only symmetric CMKs. Do not associate an
          asymmetric CMK with your log group. For more information, see  Using
          Symmetric and Asymmetric Keys .

SYNOPSIS
            create-log-group
          --log-group-name <value>
          [--kms-key-id <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --log-group-name (string)
          The name of the log group.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK to use when encrypting log
          data. For more information, see Amazon Resource Names - Key  Manage-
          ment Service .

       --tags (map)
          The key-value pairs to use for the tags.

          CloudWatch  Logs doesnt support IAM policies that prevent users from
          assigning   specified    tags    to    log    groups    using    the
          aws:Resource/*key-name* `` or ``aws:TagKeys condition keys. For more
          information about using tags  to  control  access,  see  Controlling
          access to Amazon Web Services resources using tags .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command creates a log group named my-logs:

          aws logs create-log-group --log-group-name my-logs

OUTPUT
       None
