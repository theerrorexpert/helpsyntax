PUT-RESOURCE-POLICY()                                    PUT-RESOURCE-POLICY()



NAME
       put-resource-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates or updates a resource policy allowing other Amazon Web Services
       services to put log events to this account, such as Amazon Route 53. An
       account  can  have  up  to 10 resource policies per Amazon Web Services
       Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-resource-policy
          [--policy-name <value>]
          [--policy-document <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --policy-name (string)
          Name of the new policy. This parameter is required.

       --policy-document (string)
          Details of the new policy, including the identity of  the  principal
          that  is enabled to put logs to this account. This is formatted as a
          JSON string. This parameter is required.

          The following example creates a resource policy enabling  the  Route
          53  service  to  put  DNS  query logs in to the specified log group.
          Replace "logArn" with the ARN of your CloudWatch Logs resource, such
          as a log group or log stream.

          CloudWatch  Logs  also  supports aws:SourceArn and aws:SourceAccount
          condition context keys.

          In the example resource policy,  you  would  replace  the  value  of
          SourceArn  with the resource making the call from Route 53 to Cloud-
          Watch Logs and replace the value of SourceAccount  with  the  Amazon
          Web Services account ID making that call.
              {    "Version":    "2012-10-17",   "Statement":   [   {   "Sid":
              "Route53LogsToCloudWatchLogs", "Effect": "Allow", "Principal": {
              "Service": [ "route53.amazonaws.com" ] }, "Action": "logs:PutLo-
              gEvents", "Resource":  "logArn",  "Condition":  {  "ArnLike":  {
              "aws:SourceArn":  "myRoute53ResourceArn"  },  "StringEquals":  {
              "aws:SourceAccount": "myAwsAccountId" } } } ] }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       resourcePolicy -> (structure)
          The new policy.

          policyName -> (string)
              The name of the resource policy.

          policyDocument -> (string)
              The details of the policy.

          lastUpdatedTime -> (long)
              Timestamp showing when this policy was last  updated,  expressed
              as the number of milliseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.
