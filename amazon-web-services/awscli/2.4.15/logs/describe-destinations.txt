DESCRIBE-DESTINATIONS()                                DESCRIBE-DESTINATIONS()



NAME
       describe-destinations -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  your destinations. The results are ASCII-sorted by destina-
       tion name.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-destinations is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: destinations

SYNOPSIS
            describe-destinations
          [--destination-name-prefix <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --destination-name-prefix (string)
          The  prefix to match. If you don't specify a value, no prefix filter
          is applied.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       destinations -> (list)
          The destinations.

          (structure)
              Represents  a  cross-account destination that receives subscrip-
              tion log events.

              destinationName -> (string)
                 The name of the destination.

              targetArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the physical  target  where
                 the log events are delivered (for example, a Kinesis stream).

              roleArn -> (string)
                 A role for impersonation, used when delivering log events  to
                 the target.

              accessPolicy -> (string)
                 An IAM policy document that governs which Amazon Web Services
                 accounts can create subscription filters against this  desti-
                 nation.

              arn -> (string)
                 The ARN of this destination.

              creationTime -> (long)
                 The creation time of the destination, expressed as the number
                 of milliseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of items to  return.  The  token  expires
          after 24 hours.
