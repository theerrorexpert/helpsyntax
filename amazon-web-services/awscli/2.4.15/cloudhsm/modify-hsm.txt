DESCRIPTION
       This  is documentation for AWS CloudHSM Classic . For more information,
       see AWS CloudHSM Classic FAQs , the AWS CloudHSM Classic User  Guide  ,
       and the AWS CloudHSM Classic API Reference .
          For  information about the current version of AWS CloudHSM , see AWS

       Modifies an HSM.

       WARNING:
          This operation can result in the HSM being offline for up to 15 min-
          utes while the AWS CloudHSM service is reconfigured. If you are mod-
          ifying  a  production  HSM, you should ensure that your AWS CloudHSM
          service is configured for high availability, and consider  executing
          this operation during a maintenance window.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-hsm
          --hsm-arn <value>
          [--subnet-id <value>]
          [--eni-ip <value>]
          [--iam-role-arn <value>]
          [--external-id <value>]
          [--syslog-ip <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --hsm-arn (string)
          The ARN of the HSM to modify.

       --subnet-id (string)
          The  new identifier of the subnet that the HSM is in. The new subnet
          must be in the same Availability Zone as the current subnet.

       --eni-ip (string)
          The new IP address for the elastic network interface (ENI)  attached
          to the HSM.

          If  the HSM is moved to a different subnet, and an IP address is not
          specified, an IP address will be randomly chosen from the CIDR range
          of the new subnet.

       --iam-role-arn (string)
          The new IAM role ARN.

       --external-id (string)
          The new external ID.

       --syslog-ip (string)
          The  new  IP  address  for  the  syslog  monitoring  server. The AWS
          CloudHSM service only supports one syslog monitoring server.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       HsmArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the HSM.
