       Retrieves information about a high-availability partition group.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-hapg
          --hapg-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --hapg-arn (string)
          The ARN of the high-availability partition group to describe.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       HapgArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the high-availability partition group.

       HapgSerial -> (string)
          The serial number of the high-availability partition group.

       HsmsLastActionFailed -> (list)
          (string)
              An ARN that identifies an HSM.

       HsmsPendingDeletion -> (list)
          (string)

       HsmsPendingRegistration -> (list)
          (string)
              An ARN that identifies an HSM.

       Label -> (string)
          The label for the high-availability partition group.

       LastModifiedTimestamp -> (string)
          The  date  and  time  the high-availability partition group was last
          modified.

       PartitionSerialList -> (list)
          The list of partition serial numbers that belong to the  high-avail-
          ability partition group.

          (string)
