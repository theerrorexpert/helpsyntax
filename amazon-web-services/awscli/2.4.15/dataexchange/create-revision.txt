NAME
       create-revision -

DESCRIPTION
       This operation creates a revision for a data set.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-revision
          [--comment <value>]
          --data-set-id <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --comment (string)
          An optional comment about the revision.

       --data-set-id (string)
          The unique identifier for a data set.

       --tags (map)
          A  revision  tag is an optional label that you can assign to a revi-
          sion when you create it. Each tag consists of a key and an  optional
          value,  both of which you define. When you use tagging, you can also
          use tag-based access control in IAM policies to  control  access  to
          these data sets and revisions.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The ARN for the revision.

       Comment -> (string)
          An optional comment about the revision.

       CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that the revision was created, in ISO 8601 format.

       DataSetId -> (string)
          The unique identifier for the data set associated  with  this  revi-
          sion.

       Finalized -> (boolean)
          To  publish a revision to a data set in a product, the revision must
          first be finalized. Finalizing a revision tells  AWS  Data  Exchange
          that  your changes to the assets in the revision are complete. After
          it's in this read-only state, you can publish the revision  to  your
          products.

          Finalized  revisions  can be published through the AWS Data Exchange
          console or the AWS Marketplace Catalog API, using the StartChangeSet
          AWS  Marketplace  Catalog  API action. When using the API, revisions
          are uniquely identified by their ARN.

       Id -> (string)
          The unique identifier for the revision.

       SourceId -> (string)
          The revision ID of the owned revision corresponding to the  entitled
          revision  being  viewed.  This parameter is returned when a revision
          owner is viewing the entitled copy of its owned revision.

       Tags -> (map)
          The tags for the revision.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       UpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that the revision was last updated,  in  ISO  8601
          format.
