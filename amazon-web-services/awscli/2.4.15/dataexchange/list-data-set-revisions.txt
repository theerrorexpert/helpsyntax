LIST-DATA-SET-REVISIONS()                            LIST-DATA-SET-REVISIONS()



NAME
       list-data-set-revisions -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  lists  a  data  set's revisions sorted by CreatedAt in
       descending order.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-data-set-revisions is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: Revisions

SYNOPSIS
            list-data-set-revisions
          --data-set-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --data-set-id (string)
          The unique identifier for a data set.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The token value retrieved from a previous call to  access  the  next
          page of results.

       Revisions -> (list)
          The asset objects listed by the request.

          (structure)
              A revision is a container for one or more assets.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The ARN for the revision.

              Comment -> (string)
                 An optional comment about the revision.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  date and time that the revision was created, in ISO 8601
                 format.

              DataSetId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the data set associated  with  this
                 revision.

              Finalized -> (boolean)
                 To  publish  a revision to a data set in a product, the revi-
                 sion must first be finalized. Finalizing a revision tells AWS
                 Data Exchange that your changes to the assets in the revision
                 are complete. After it's in this  read-only  state,  you  can
                 publish the revision to your products.

                 Finalized  revisions  can  be  published through the AWS Data
                 Exchange console or the AWS Marketplace  Catalog  API,  using
                 the  StartChangeSet  AWS Marketplace Catalog API action. When
                 using the API, revisions are  uniquely  identified  by  their
                 ARN.

              Id -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the revision.

              SourceId -> (string)
                 The  revision  ID  of the owned revision corresponding to the
                 entitled revision being viewed. This  parameter  is  returned
                 when  a  revision  owner  is viewing the entitled copy of its
                 owned revision.

              UpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the revision was last updated, in  ISO
                 8601 format.
