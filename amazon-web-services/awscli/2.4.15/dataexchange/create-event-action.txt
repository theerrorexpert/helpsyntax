OPTIONS
       --action (structure)
          What occurs after a certain event.

          ExportRevisionToS3 -> (structure)
              Details for the export revision to Amazon S3 action.

              Encryption -> (structure)

                 KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the AWS KMS key you
                     want to use to encrypt the Amazon S3 objects. This param-
                     eter  is  required if you choose aws:kms as an encryption
                     type.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The type of server side encryption  used  for  encrypting
                     the objects in Amazon S3.

              RevisionDestination -> (structure)
                 A  revision destination is the Amazon S3 bucket folder desti-
                 nation to where the export will be sent.

                 Bucket -> (string)
                     The S3 bucket that  is  the  destination  for  the  event
                     action.

                 KeyPattern -> (string)
                     A  string representing the pattern for generated names of
                     the individual assets in the revision. For more  informa-
                     tion  about key patterns, see Key patterns when exporting
                     revisions .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ExportRevisionToS3={Encryption={KmsKeyArn=string,Type=string},RevisionDestination={Bucket=string,KeyPattern=string}}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ExportRevisionToS3": {
              "Encryption": {
                "KmsKeyArn": "string",
                "Type": "aws:kms"|"AES256"
              },
              "RevisionDestination": {
                "Bucket": "string",
                "KeyPattern": "string"
              }
            }
          }

       --event (structure)
          What occurs to start an action.

          RevisionPublished -> (structure)
              What occurs to start the revision publish action.

              DataSetId -> (string)
                 The data set ID of the published revision.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RevisionPublished={DataSetId=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "RevisionPublished": {
              "DataSetId": "string"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
