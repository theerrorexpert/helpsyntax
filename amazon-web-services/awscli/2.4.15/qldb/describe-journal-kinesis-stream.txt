DESCRIBE-JOURNAL-KINESIS-STREAM()            DESCRIBE-JOURNAL-KINESIS-STREAM()



NAME
       describe-journal-kinesis-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  detailed information about a given Amazon QLDB journal stream.
       The output includes the Amazon Resource Name (ARN), stream  name,  cur-
       rent  status,  creation time, and the parameters of the original stream
       creation request.

       This action does not return  any  expired  journal  streams.  For  more
       information,  see  Expiration  for  terminal streams in the Amazon QLDB
       Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-journal-kinesis-stream
          --ledger-name <value>
          --stream-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --ledger-name (string)
          The name of the ledger.

       --stream-id (string)
          The UUID (represented in Base62-encoded text) of  the  QLDB  journal
          stream to describe.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe a journal stream

       The  following  describe-journal-kinesis-stream  example  displays  the
       details for the specified journal stream from a ledger.

          aws qldb describe-journal-kinesis-stream \
              --ledger-name myExampleLedger \
              --stream-id 7ISCkqwe4y25YyHLzYUFAf

       Output:

          {
              "Stream": {
                  "LedgerName": "myExampleLedger",
                  "CreationTime": 1591221984.677,
                  "InclusiveStartTime": 1590710400.0,
                  "ExclusiveEndTime": 1590796799.0,
                  "RoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-kinesis-stream-role",
                  "StreamId": "7ISCkqwe4y25YyHLzYUFAf",
                  "Arn": "arn:aws:qldb:us-east-1:123456789012:stream/myExampleLedger/7ISCkqwe4y25YyHLzYUFAf",
                  "Status": "ACTIVE",
                  "KinesisConfiguration": {
                      "StreamArn": "arn:aws:kinesis:us-east-1:123456789012:stream/stream-for-qldb",
                      "AggregationEnabled": true
                  },
                  "StreamName": "myExampleLedger-stream"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       Stream -> (structure)
          Information   about   the   QLDB   journal   stream  returned  by  a
          DescribeJournalS3Export request.

          LedgerName -> (string)
              The name of the ledger.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time, in epoch time format, when the  QLDB  journal
              stream  was created. (Epoch time format is the number of seconds
              elapsed since 12:00:00 AM January 1, 1970 UTC.)

          InclusiveStartTime -> (timestamp)
              The inclusive start date and time from which to start  streaming
              journal data.

          ExclusiveEndTime -> (timestamp)
              The exclusive date and time that specifies when the stream ends.
              If this parameter is undefined,  the  stream  runs  indefinitely
              until you cancel it.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that grants QLDB
              permissions for a journal stream to  write  data  records  to  a
              Kinesis Data Streams resource.

          StreamId -> (string)
              The  UUID (represented in Base62-encoded text) of the QLDB jour-
              nal stream.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the QLDB journal stream.

          Status -> (string)
              The current state of the QLDB journal stream.

          KinesisConfiguration -> (structure)
              The configuration settings of the Amazon  Kinesis  Data  Streams
              destination for a QLDB journal stream.

              StreamArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the Kinesis Data Streams
                 resource.

              AggregationEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Enables QLDB to publish multiple data  records  in  a  single
                 Kinesis Data Streams record, increasing the number of records
                 sent per API call.
                     This option is enabled by default. Record aggregation has
                     important   implications   for   processing  records  and
                     requires de-aggregation in your stream consumer. To learn
                     more, see KPL Key Concepts and Consumer De-aggregation in
                     the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide .

          ErrorCause -> (string)
              The error message that describes the reason that a stream has  a
              status of IMPAIRED or FAILED . This is not applicable to streams
              that have other status values.

          StreamName -> (string)
              The user-defined name of the QLDB journal stream.
