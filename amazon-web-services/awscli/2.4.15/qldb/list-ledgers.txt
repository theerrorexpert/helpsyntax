LIST-LEDGERS()                                                  LIST-LEDGERS()



NAME
       list-ledgers -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  an array of ledger summaries that are associated with the cur-
       rent Amazon Web Services account and Region.

       This action returns a maximum of 100 items and is paginated so that you
       can retrieve all the items by calling ListLedgers multiple times.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-ledgers
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  results  to return in a single ListLedgers
          request. (The actual number of results returned might be fewer.)

       --next-token (string)
          A pagination token, indicating that you want to  retrieve  the  next
          page  of  results.  If  you  received  a  value for NextToken in the
          response from a previous ListLedgers call, then you should use  that
          value as input here.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list your available ledgers

       The  following  list-ledgers example lists all ledgers that are associ-
       ated with the current AWS account and Region.

          aws qldb list-ledgers

       Output:

          {
              "Ledgers": [
                  {
                      "State": "ACTIVE",
                      "CreationDateTime": 1568839243.951,
                      "Name": "myExampleLedger"
                  },
                  {
                      "State": "ACTIVE",
                      "CreationDateTime": 1568839543.557,
                      "Name": "myExampleLedger2"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Ledgers -> (list)
          The  array  of ledger summaries that are associated with the current
          Amazon Web Services account and Region.

          (structure)
              Information about a ledger, including its name, state, and  when
              it was created.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the ledger.

              State -> (string)
                 The current status of the ledger.

              CreationDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date and time, in epoch time format, when the ledger was
                 created. (Epoch time format is the number of seconds  elapsed
                 since 12:00:00 AM January 1, 1970 UTC.)

       NextToken -> (string)
          A pagination token, indicating whether there are more results avail-
          able:

          o If NextToken is empty, then the last page of results has been pro-
            cessed and there are no more results to be retrieved.

          o If  NextToken is not empty, then there are more results available.
            To retrieve the next page of results, use the value  of  NextToken
            in a subsequent ListLedgers call.
