LIST-JOURNAL-S3-EXPORTS()                            LIST-JOURNAL-S3-EXPORTS()



NAME
       list-journal-s3-exports -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  an  array  of  journal export job descriptions for all ledgers
       that are associated with the current Amazon Web  Services  account  and
       Region.

       This  action returns a maximum of MaxResults items, and is paginated so
       that you can retrieve all the  items  by  calling  ListJournalS3Exports
       multiple times.

       This  action does not return any expired export jobs. For more informa-
       tion, see Export job expiration in the Amazon QLDB Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-journal-s3-exports
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of  results  to  return  in  a  single  ListJour-
          nalS3Exports  request.  (The actual number of results returned might
          be fewer.)

       --next-token (string)
          A pagination token, indicating that you want to  retrieve  the  next
          page  of  results.  If  you  received  a  value for NextToken in the
          response from a previous ListJournalS3Exports call, then you  should
          use that value as input here.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list journal export jobs

       The following list-journal-s3-exports example lists journal export jobs
       for all ledgers that are associated with the current  AWS  account  and
       Region.

          aws qldb list-journal-s3-exports

                     The Amazon S3 bucket name in which a journal  export  job
                     writes the journal contents.

                     The  bucket  name  must  comply with the Amazon S3 bucket
                     naming conventions.  For  more  information,  see  Bucket

                     o My:Tests/

                 EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)

                     job to write data in an Amazon S3 bucket.

                     ObjectEncryptionType -> (string)
                        The Amazon S3 object encryption type.

                        To learn more about server-side encryption options  in
                        Amazon  S3,  see  Protecting  Data  Using  Server-Side

                        port asymmetric KMS keys.

                        You must provide a KmsKeyArn if you specify SSE_KMS as
                        the ObjectEncryptionType .
                            KmsKeyArn is not required if you specify SSE_S3 as
                            the ObjectEncryptionType .

                 QLDB  permissions  for a journal export job to do the follow-
                 ing:

                 o Write objects into your Amazon Simple Storage Service (Ama-
                   zon S3) bucket.

                 o (Optional)  Use your customer managed key in Key Management
                   Service (KMS) for server-side encryption of  your  exported
                   data.

              OutputFormat -> (string)
                 The output format of the exported journal data.

       NextToken -> (string)

          o If NextToken is empty, then the last page of results has been pro-
            cessed and there are no more results to be retrieved.

          o If NextToken is not empty, then there are more results  available.
            To  retrieve  the next page of results, use the value of NextToken
            in a subsequent ListJournalS3Exports call.
