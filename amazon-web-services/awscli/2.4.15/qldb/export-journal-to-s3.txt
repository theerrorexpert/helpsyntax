EXPORT-JOURNAL-TO-S3()                                  EXPORT-JOURNAL-TO-S3()



NAME
       export-journal-to-s3 -

DESCRIPTION
       Exports  journal  contents  within  a date and time range from a ledger
       into a specified Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon  S3)  bucket.  A
       journal  export  job  can  write the data objects in either the text or
       binary representation of Amazon Ion format, or in JSON Lines text  for-
       mat.

       In JSON Lines format, each journal block in the exported data object is
       a valid JSON object that is delimited by a newline. You  can  use  this
       format  to  easily  integrate JSON exports with analytics tools such as
       Glue and Amazon Athena because these services can parse  newline-delim-
       ited  JSON  automatically.  For  more information about the format, see
       JSON Lines .

       If  the  ledger  with  the  given  Name  doesn't  exist,  then   throws
       ResourceNotFoundException .

       If  the  ledger  with the given Name is in CREATING status, then throws
       ResourcePreconditionNotMetException .

       You can initiate up to two concurrent journal export requests for  each
       ledger.  Beyond  this limit, journal export requests throw LimitExceed-
       edException .

SYNOPSIS
            export-journal-to-s3
          --name <value>
          --inclusive-start-time <value>
          --exclusive-end-time <value>
          --s3-export-configuration <value>
          --role-arn <value>
          [--output-format <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the ledger.

       --inclusive-start-time (timestamp)
          The inclusive start date and time for the range of journal  contents
          to export.

          The  InclusiveStartTime must be in ISO 8601 date and time format and
          in    Universal    Coordinated    Time    (UTC).    For     example:
          2019-06-13T21:36:34Z .

          The InclusiveStartTime must be before ExclusiveEndTime .

          If  you  provide  an  InclusiveStartTime that is before the ledger's
          CreationDateTime , Amazon QLDB defaults it to the ledger's Creation-
          DateTime .

       --exclusive-end-time (timestamp)
          The exclusive end date and time for the range of journal contents to
          export.

          The ExclusiveEndTime must be in ISO 8601 date and time format and in
          Universal  Coordinated Time (UTC). For example: 2019-06-13T21:36:34Z
          .

          The ExclusiveEndTime must be less than or equal to the  current  UTC
          date and time.

       --s3-export-configuration (structure)
          The  configuration  settings of the Amazon S3 bucket destination for
          your export request.

          Bucket -> (string)
              The Amazon S3 bucket name in which a journal export  job  writes
              the journal contents.

              The  bucket  name  must  comply with the Amazon S3 bucket naming
              conventions. For more information, see Bucket  Restrictions  and
              Limitations in the Amazon S3 Developer Guide .

          Prefix -> (string)
              The  prefix  for  the Amazon S3 bucket in which a journal export
              job writes the journal contents.

              The prefix must comply with  Amazon  S3  key  naming  rules  and
              restrictions.  For more information, see Object Key and Metadata
              in the Amazon S3 Developer Guide .

              The following are examples of valid Prefix values:

              o JournalExports-ForMyLedger/Testing/

              o JournalExports

              o My:Tests/

          EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
              The encryption settings that are used by a journal export job to
              write data in an Amazon S3 bucket.

              ObjectEncryptionType -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 object encryption type.

                 To  learn more about server-side encryption options in Amazon
                 S3, see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption  in  the
                 Amazon S3 Developer Guide .

              KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a symmetric key in Key Man-
                 agement Service (KMS). Amazon S3 does not support  asymmetric
                 KMS keys.

                 You  must  provide  a KmsKeyArn if you specify SSE_KMS as the
                 ObjectEncryptionType .
                     KmsKeyArn is not required if you specify  SSE_S3  as  the
                     ObjectEncryptionType .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Bucket=string,Prefix=string,EncryptionConfiguration={ObjectEncryptionType=string,KmsKeyArn=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Bucket": "string",
            "Prefix": "string",
            "EncryptionConfiguration": {
              "ObjectEncryptionType": "SSE_KMS"|"SSE_S3"|"NO_ENCRYPTION",
              "KmsKeyArn": "string"
            }
          }

       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that grants QLDB per-
          missions for a journal export job to do the following:

          o Write objects into your Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon  S3)
            bucket.

          o (Optional) Use your customer managed key in Key Management Service
            (KMS) for server-side encryption of your exported data.

          To pass a role to QLDB when requesting a journal  export,  you  must
          have  permissions to perform the iam:PassRole action on the IAM role
          resource. This is required for all journal export requests.

       --output-format (string)
          The output format of your exported journal data. If  this  parameter
          is not specified, the exported data defaults to ION_TEXT format.

          Possible values:

          o ION_BINARY

          o ION_TEXT

          o JSON

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To export journal blocks to S3

       The  following  export-journal-to-s3  example creates an export job for
       journal blocks within a specified date and time  range  from  a  ledger
       with  the name myExampleLedger. The export job writes the blocks into a
       specified Amazon S3 bucket.

          aws qldb export-journal-to-s3 \
              --name myExampleLedger \
              --inclusive-start-time 2019-09-18T00:00:00Z \
              --exclusive-end-time 2019-09-18T22:59:59Z \
              --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-s3-export-role \
              --s3-export-configuration file://my-s3-export-config.json

       Contents of my-s3-export-config.json:

          {
              "Bucket": "awsExampleBucket",
              "Prefix": "ledgerexport1/",
              "EncryptionConfiguration": {
                  "ObjectEncryptionType": "SSE_S3"
              }
          }

       Output:

          {
              "ExportId": "ADR2ONPKN5LINYGb4dp7yZ"
          }

       For more information, see Exporting Your Journal in Amazon QLDB in  the
       Amazon QLDB Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       ExportId -> (string)
          The  UUID  (represented in Base62-encoded text) that QLDB assigns to
          each journal export job.

          To describe your export request and check the status of the job, you
          can use ExportId to call DescribeJournalS3Export .
