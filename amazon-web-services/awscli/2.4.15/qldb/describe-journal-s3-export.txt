NAME
       describe-journal-s3-export -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  a journal export job, including the ledger
       name, export ID, creation time, current status, and the  parameters  of
       the original export creation request.

       This  action does not return any expired export jobs. For more informa-
       tion, see Export job expiration in the Amazon QLDB Developer Guide .

       If the export job with the given ExportId doesn't  exist,  then  throws
       ResourceNotFoundException .

       If   the  ledger  with  the  given  Name  doesn't  exist,  then  throws
       ResourceNotFoundException .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-journal-s3-export
          --name <value>
          --export-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the ledger.

       --export-id (string)
          The UUID (represented in Base62-encoded text) of the journal  export
          job to describe.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              created. (Epoch time format is the  number  of  seconds  elapsed

          ExclusiveEndTime -> (timestamp)
              The exclusive end date and time for the range  of  journal  con-
              tents that was specified in the original export request.

          S3ExportConfiguration -> (structure)

              which a journal export job writes the journal contents.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 bucket name  in  which  a  journal  export  job
                 writes the journal contents.

                 The  bucket name must comply with the Amazon S3 bucket naming
                 conventions. For more information,  see  Bucket  Restrictions

                     To  learn  more  about  server-side encryption options in
                     Amazon S3, see Protecting Data Using Server-Side  Encryp-

                     asymmetric KMS keys.

                     You  must  provide  a KmsKeyArn if you specify SSE_KMS as
                     the ObjectEncryptionType .
                        KmsKeyArn is not required if you specify SSE_S3 as the
