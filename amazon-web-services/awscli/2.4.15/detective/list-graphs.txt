LIST-GRAPHS()                                                    LIST-GRAPHS()



NAME
       list-graphs -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  list  of  behavior  graphs that the calling account is an
       administrator account of. This operation  can  only  be  called  by  an
       administrator account.

       Because  an  account  can  currently  only  be the administrator of one
       behavior graph within a Region, the results  always  contain  a  single
       behavior graph.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-graphs
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          For  requests  to get the next page of results, the pagination token
          that was returned with the previous  set  of  results.  The  initial
          request does not include a pagination token.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of graphs to return at a time. The total must be
          less than the overall limit on the  number  of  results  to  return,
          which is currently 200.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To  view a list of behavior graphs that your account is the administra-
       tor for

       The following list-graphs example retrieves the  behavior  graphs  that
       the calling account is the administrator for within the current Region.

          aws detective list-graphs

       Output:

          {
              "GraphList": [
                  {
                      "Arn": "arn:aws:detective:us-east-1:111122223333:graph:123412341234",
                      "CreatedTime": 1579736111000
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       GraphList -> (list)
          A list of behavior graphs  that  the  account  is  an  administrator
          account for.

          (structure)
              A behavior graph in Detective.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the behavior graph.

              CreatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time that the behavior graph was created. The
                 value  is  an  ISO8601   formatted   string.   For   example,
                 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  there  are  more  behavior graphs remaining in the results, then
          this is the pagination token to use to  request  the  next  page  of
          behavior graphs.
