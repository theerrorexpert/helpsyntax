CREATE-MEMBERS()                                              CREATE-MEMBERS()



NAME
       create-members -

DESCRIPTION
          CreateMembers is used to send invitations to accounts. For the orga-
          nization behavior graph, the Detective  administrator  account  uses
          CreateMembers to enable organization accounts as member accounts.

       For invited accounts, CreateMembers sends a request to invite the spec-
       ified Amazon Web Services accounts to be member accounts in the  behav-
       ior  graph.  This  operation  can  only  be called by the administrator
       account for a behavior graph.
          CreateMembers verifies the accounts and then  invites  the  verified
          accounts. The administrator can optionally specify to not send invi-
          tation emails to the member accounts. This would be  used  when  the
          administrator manages their member accounts centrally.

       For  organization  accounts in the organization behavior graph, Create-
       Members attempts to enable the accounts. The organization  accounts  do
       not receive invitations.

       The request provides the behavior graph ARN and the list of accounts to
       invite or to enable.

       The response separates the requested accounts into two lists:

       o The accounts that CreateMembers was  able  to  process.  For  invited
         accounts, includes member accounts that are being verified, that have
         passed verification and are to be invited, and that have failed veri-
         fication.  For  organization  accounts  in  the organization behavior
         graph, includes accounts that can  be  enabled  and  that  cannot  be
         enabled.

       o The  accounts  that  CreateMembers  was  unable to process. This list
         includes accounts that were already invited to be member accounts  in
         the behavior graph.

SYNOPSIS
            create-members
          --graph-arn <value>
          [--message <value>]
          [--disable-email-notification | --no-disable-email-notification]
          --accounts <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --graph-arn (string)
          The ARN of the behavior graph.

       --message (string)
          Customized  message  text to include in the invitation email message
          to the invited member accounts.

       --disable-email-notification     |      --no-disable-email-notification
       (boolean)
          if  set  to  true  ,  then the invited accounts do not receive email
          notifications. By default, this is set to false ,  and  the  invited
          accounts receive email notifications.

          Organization  accounts  in  the  organization  behavior graph do not
          receive email notifications.

       --accounts (list)
          The list of Amazon Web Services accounts to invite or to enable. You
          can  invite  or enable up to 50 accounts at a time. For each invited
          account, the account list contains the account  identifier  and  the
          Amazon  Web  Services account root user email address. For organiza-
          tion accounts in the organization behavior graph, the email  address
          is not required.

          (structure)
              An Amazon Web Services account that is the administrator account
              of or a member of a behavior graph.

              AccountId -> (string)
                 The account identifier of the Amazon Web Services account.

              EmailAddress -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account root user email  address  for
                 the Amazon Web Services account.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AccountId=string,EmailAddress=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "AccountId": "string",
              "EmailAddress": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To invite member accounts to a behavior graph

       The following create-members example invites two AWS accounts to become
       member    accounts    in    the    behavior    graph     arn:aws:detec-
       tive:us-east-1:111122223333:graph:123412341234.  For  each account, the
       request provides the AWS account ID and the  account  root  user  email
       address. The request includes a custom message to insert into the invi-
       tation email.

          aws detective create-members \
              --accounts AccountId=444455556666,EmailAddress=mmajor@example.com AccountId=123456789012,EmailAddress=jstiles@example.com \
              --graph-arn arn:aws:detective:us-east-1:111122223333:graph:123412341234 \
              --message "This is Paul Santos. I need to add your account to the data we use for security investigation in Amazon Detective. If you have any questions, contact me at psantos@example.com."

       To invite member accounts without sending invitation emails

       The following create-members example invites two AWS accounts to become
       member     accounts    in    the    behavior    graph    arn:aws:detec-
       tive:us-east-1:111122223333:graph:123412341234. For each  account,  the
       request  provides  the  AWS  account ID and the account root user email
       address. The member accounts do not receive invitation emails.

          aws detective create-members \
              --accounts AccountId=444455556666,EmailAddress=mmajor@example.com AccountId=123456789012,EmailAddress=jstiles@example.com \

OUTPUT
       Members -> (list)
          The set of member account invitation  or  enablement  requests  that
          Detective was able to process. This includes accounts that are being
          verified, that failed verification, and that passed verification and
          are being sent an invitation or are being enabled.

          (structure)
              Details about a member account in a behavior graph.

              AccountId -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web  Services  account identifier for the member
                 account.

              EmailAddress -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account root user email  address  for
                 the member account.

              GraphArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the behavior graph.

              MasterId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account identifier of the administra-
                 tor account for the behavior graph.

              AdministratorId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account identifier of the administra-
                 tor account for the behavior graph.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current membership status of the member account. The sta-
                 tus can have one of the following values:

                 o INVITED - For invited accounts  only.  Indicates  that  the
                   member was sent an invitation but has not yet responded.

                 o VERIFICATION_IN_PROGRESS - For invited accounts only, indi-
                   cates that Detective is verifying that the account  identi-
                   fier  and  email  address  provided  for the member account
                   match. If they do match, then Detective sends  the  invita-
                   tion.  If  the  email  address and account identifier don't
                   match, then the member cannot  be  added  to  the  behavior
                   graph. For organization accounts in the organization behav-
                   ior graph, indicates that Detective is verifying  that  the
                   account belongs to the organization.

                 o VERIFICATION_FAILED  - For invited accounts only. Indicates
                   that the account and email address provided for the  member
                   account do not match, and Detective did not send an invita-
                   tion to the account.

                 o ENABLED - Indicates that the member account currently  con-
                   tributes  data to the behavior graph. For invited accounts,
                   the member account accepted the invitation.  For  organiza-
                   tion  accounts  in  the  organization  behavior  graph, the
                   Detective administrator account  enabled  the  organization
                   account as a member account.

                 o ACCEPTED_BUT_DISABLED  -  The  account accepted the invita-
                   tion,  or  was  enabled  by  the  Detective   administrator
                   account,  but  is  prevented  from contributing data to the
                   behavior graph. DisabledReason provides the reason why  the
                   member account is not enabled.

                 Invited  accounts  that  declined  an invitation or that were
                 removed from the behavior graph  are  not  included.  In  the
                 organization  behavior  graph, organization accounts that the
                 Detective  administrator  account  did  not  enable  are  not
                 included.

              DisabledReason -> (string)
                 For  member accounts with a status of ACCEPTED_BUT_DISABLED ,
                 the reason that the member account is not enabled.

                 The reason can have one of the following values:

                 o VOLUME_TOO_HIGH - Indicates that adding the member  account
                   would  cause  the  data volume for the behavior graph to be
                   too high.

                 o VOLUME_UNKNOWN - Indicates that Detective is unable to ver-
                   ify the data volume for the member account. This is usually
                   because the member account is not enrolled in Amazon Guard-
                   Duty.

              InvitedTime -> (timestamp)
                 For  invited  accounts, the date and time that Detective sent
                 the invitation to the account. The value is an  ISO8601  for-
                 matted string. For example, 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .

              UpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and time that the member account was last updated.
                 The value  is  an  ISO8601  formatted  string.  For  example,
                 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .

              VolumeUsageInBytes -> (long)
                 The data volume in bytes per day for the member account.

              VolumeUsageUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  data  and  time  when the member account data volume was
                 last updated. The value is an ISO8601 formatted  string.  For
                 example, 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .

              PercentOfGraphUtilization -> (double)
                 The member account data volume as a percentage of the maximum
                 allowed data volume. 0 indicates 0 percent, and 100 indicates
                 100 percent.

                 Note  that  this  is not the percentage of the behavior graph
                 data volume.

                 For example, the data volume for the behavior graph is 80  GB
                 per  day.  The  maximum data volume is 160 GB per day. If the
                 data volume for the member account is 40  GB  per  day,  then
                 PercentOfGraphUtilization  is  25.  It  represents 25% of the
                 maximum allowed data volume.

              PercentOfGraphUtilizationUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the graph utilization  percentage  was
                 last  updated.  The value is an ISO8601 formatted string. For
                 example, 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .

              InvitationType -> (string)
                 The type of behavior graph membership.

                 For an organization  account  in  the  organization  behavior
                 graph, the type is ORGANIZATION .

                 For an account that was invited to a behavior graph, the type
                 is INVITATION .

       UnprocessedAccounts -> (list)
          The list of accounts for which Detective was unable to  process  the
          invitation  or  enablement  request. For each account, the list pro-
          vides the reason why the request could not be  processed.  The  list
          includes  accounts  that are already member accounts in the behavior
          graph.

          (structure)
              A member account that was included in a request  but  for  which
              the request could not be processed.

              AccountId -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web  Services  account  identifier of the member
                 account that was not processed.

              Reason -> (string)
                 The reason that the member account request could not be  pro-
                 cessed.
