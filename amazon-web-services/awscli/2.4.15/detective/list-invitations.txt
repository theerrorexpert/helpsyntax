LIST-INVITATIONS()                                          LIST-INVITATIONS()



NAME
       list-invitations -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the list of open and accepted behavior graph invitations for
       the member account. This operation can only be  called  by  an  invited
       member account.

       Open  invitations  are  invitations  that  the  member  account has not
       responded to.

       The results do not include behavior graphs for which the member account
       declined  the  invitation.  The  results  also  do not include behavior
       graphs that the member account resigned from or was removed from.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-invitations
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          For requests to retrieve the next page of  results,  the  pagination
          token  that was returned with the previous page of results. The ini-
          tial request does not include a pagination token.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of behavior graph invitations to  return  in  the
          response.  The total must be less than the overall limit on the num-
          ber of results to return, which is currently 200.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To view a list of behavior graphs that an account is a member of or  is
       invited to

       The  following  list-invitations  example retrieves the behavior graphs
       that the calling account has been invited to. The results include  only
       open and accepted invitations. They do not include rejected invitations
       or removed memberships.

OUTPUT
       Invitations -> (list)
          The list of behavior graphs for which the member account has open or
          accepted invitations.

          (structure)
              Details about a member account in a behavior graph.

              AccountId -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web  Services  account identifier for the member
                 account.

              EmailAddress -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account root user email  address  for
                 the member account.

              GraphArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the behavior graph.

              MasterId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account identifier of the administra-
                 tor account for the behavior graph.

              AdministratorId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account identifier of the administra-
                 tor account for the behavior graph.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current membership status of the member account. The sta-
                 tus can have one of the following values:

                 o INVITED - For invited accounts  only.  Indicates  that  the
                   member was sent an invitation but has not yet responded.

                 o VERIFICATION_IN_PROGRESS - For invited accounts only, indi-
                   cates that Detective is verifying that the account  identi-
                   fier  and  email  address  provided  for the member account
                   match. If they do match, then Detective sends  the  invita-
                   tion.  If  the  email  address and account identifier don't
                   match, then the member cannot  be  added  to  the  behavior
                   graph. For organization accounts in the organization behav-
                   ior graph, indicates that Detective is verifying  that  the
                   account belongs to the organization.

                 o VERIFICATION_FAILED  - For invited accounts only. Indicates
                   that the account and email address provided for the  member
                   account do not match, and Detective did not send an invita-
                   tion to the account.

                 o ENABLED - Indicates that the member account currently  con-
                   tributes  data to the behavior graph. For invited accounts,
                   the member account accepted the invitation.  For  organiza-
                   tion  accounts  in  the  organization  behavior  graph, the
                   Detective administrator account  enabled  the  organization
                   account as a member account.

                 o ACCEPTED_BUT_DISABLED  -  The  account accepted the invita-
                   tion,  or  was  enabled  by  the  Detective   administrator
                   account,  but  is  prevented  from contributing data to the
                   behavior graph. DisabledReason provides the reason why  the
                   member account is not enabled.

                 Invited  accounts  that  declined  an invitation or that were
                 removed from the behavior graph  are  not  included.  In  the
                 organization  behavior  graph, organization accounts that the
                 Detective  administrator  account  did  not  enable  are  not
                 included.

              DisabledReason -> (string)
                 For  member accounts with a status of ACCEPTED_BUT_DISABLED ,
                 the reason that the member account is not enabled.

                 The reason can have one of the following values:

                 o VOLUME_TOO_HIGH - Indicates that adding the member  account
                   would  cause  the  data volume for the behavior graph to be
                   too high.

                 o VOLUME_UNKNOWN - Indicates that Detective is unable to ver-
                   ify the data volume for the member account. This is usually
                   because the member account is not enrolled in Amazon Guard-
                   Duty.

              InvitedTime -> (timestamp)
                 For  invited  accounts, the date and time that Detective sent
                 the invitation to the account. The value is an  ISO8601  for-
                 matted string. For example, 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .

              UpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and time that the member account was last updated.
                 The value  is  an  ISO8601  formatted  string.  For  example,
                 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .

              VolumeUsageInBytes -> (long)
                 The data volume in bytes per day for the member account.

              VolumeUsageUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  data  and  time  when the member account data volume was
                 last updated. The value is an ISO8601 formatted  string.  For
                 example, 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .

              PercentOfGraphUtilization -> (double)
                 The member account data volume as a percentage of the maximum
                 allowed data volume. 0 indicates 0 percent, and 100 indicates
                 100 percent.

                 Note  that  this  is not the percentage of the behavior graph
                 data volume.

                 For example, the data volume for the behavior graph is 80  GB
                 per  day.  The  maximum data volume is 160 GB per day. If the
                 data volume for the member account is 40  GB  per  day,  then
                 PercentOfGraphUtilization  is  25.  It  represents 25% of the
                 maximum allowed data volume.

              PercentOfGraphUtilizationUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the graph utilization  percentage  was
                 last  updated.  The value is an ISO8601 formatted string. For
                 example, 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .

              InvitationType -> (string)
                 The type of behavior graph membership.

                 For an organization  account  in  the  organization  behavior
                 graph, the type is ORGANIZATION .

                 For an account that was invited to a behavior graph, the type
                 is INVITATION .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If there are more behavior graphs remaining  in  the  results,  then
          this  is  the  pagination  token  to use to request the next page of
          behavior graphs.
