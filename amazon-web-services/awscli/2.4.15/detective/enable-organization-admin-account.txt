NAME
       enable-organization-admin-account -

DESCRIPTION
       Designates  the Detective administrator account for the organization in
       the current Region.

       If the account does not have Detective enabled, then enables  Detective
       for that account and creates a new behavior graph.

       Can only be called by the organization management account.

       The  Detective  administrator  account  for an organization must be the
       same in all Regions. If you already designated a Detective  administra-
       tor  account  in  another  Region,  then  you  must  designate the same
       account.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            enable-organization-admin-account
          --account-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account identifier of the account to  desig-
          nate as the Detective administrator account for the organization.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
