DISASSOCIATE-MEMBERSHIP()                            DISASSOCIATE-MEMBERSHIP()



NAME
       disassociate-membership -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  the  member  account  from  the specified behavior graph. This
       operation can only be called by an invited member account that has  the
       ENABLED status.
          DisassociateMembership  cannot  be called by an organization account
          in the organization behavior graph. For  the  organization  behavior
          graph,  the Detective administrator account determines which organi-
          zation accounts to enable or disable as member accounts.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disassociate-membership
          --graph-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --graph-arn (string)
          The ARN of the behavior graph to remove the member account from.

          The member account's member status in the  behavior  graph  must  be
          ENABLED .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To resign membership from a behavior graph

       The  following  disassociate-membership example removes the AWS account
       that  runs  the  command  from  the   behavior   graph   arn:aws:detec-
       tive:us-east-1:111122223333:graph:123412341234.

          aws detective disassociate-membership \
