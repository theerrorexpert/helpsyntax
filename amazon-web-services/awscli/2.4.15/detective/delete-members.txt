DELETE-MEMBERS()                                              DELETE-MEMBERS()



NAME
       delete-members -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  the  specified  member  accounts  from the behavior graph. The
       removed accounts no longer contribute data to the behavior graph.  This
       operation  can  only  be  called  by  the administrator account for the
       behavior graph.

       For invited accounts, the removed accounts are deleted from the list of
       accounts in the behavior graph. To restore the account, the administra-
       tor account must send another invitation.

       For organization accounts  in  the  organization  behavior  graph,  the
       Detective  administrator  account  can  always  enable the organization
       account again. Organization accounts that are  not  enabled  as  member
       accounts  are not included in the ListMembers results for the organiza-
       tion behavior graph.

       An administrator account cannot use DeleteMembers to remove  their  own
       account  from  the  behavior  graph.  To  disable a behavior graph, the
       administrator account uses the DeleteGraph API method.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-members
          --graph-arn <value>
          --account-ids <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --graph-arn (string)
          The ARN of the behavior graph to remove members from.

       --account-ids (list)
          The list of Amazon Web Services account identifiers for  the  member
          accounts  to remove from the behavior graph. You can remove up to 50
          member accounts at a time.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To remove member accounts from a behavior graph

       The following delete-members example removes two member  accounts  from
       the              behavior              graph             arn:aws:detec-
       tive:us-east-1:111122223333:graph:123412341234.   To    identify    the
       accounts, the request provides the AWS account IDs.

          aws detective delete-members \
              --account-ids 444455556666 123456789012 \
              --graph-arn arn:aws:detective:us-east-1:111122223333:graph:123412341234

       Output:

           {
              "AccountIds": [ "444455556666", "123456789012" ],
              "UnprocessedAccounts": [ ]
          }

OUTPUT
       AccountIds -> (list)
          The  list  of Amazon Web Services account identifiers for the member
          accounts that  Detective  successfully  removed  from  the  behavior
          graph.

          (string)

       UnprocessedAccounts -> (list)
          The  list  of  member accounts that Detective was not able to remove
          from the behavior graph. For each member account, provides the  rea-
          son that the deletion could not be processed.

          (structure)
              A  member  account  that was included in a request but for which
              the request could not be processed.

              AccountId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services  account  identifier  of  the  member
                 account that was not processed.

              Reason -> (string)
                 The  reason that the member account request could not be pro-
                 cessed.
