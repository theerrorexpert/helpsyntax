NAME
       list-members -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the list of member accounts for a behavior graph.

       For  invited  accounts, the results do not include member accounts that
       were removed from the behavior graph.

       For the organization behavior graph, the results do not include organi-
       zation  accounts  that  the  Detective  administrator  account  has not
       enabled as member accounts.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-members
          --graph-arn <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --graph-arn (string)
          The ARN of the behavior graph for which to retrieve the list of mem-
          ber accounts.

       --next-token (string)
          For  requests  to  retrieve the next page of member account results,
          the pagination token that was returned with  the  previous  page  of
          results. The initial request does not include a pagination token.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of member accounts to include in the response.
          The total must be less than the  overall  limit  on  the  number  of
          results to return, which is currently 200.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the member accounts in a behavior graph

       The  following  list-members  example retrieves the invited and enabled
       member    accounts    for    the    behavior    graph    arn:aws:detec-
       tive:us-east-1:111122223333:graph:123412341234.   The  results  do  not
       include member accounts that were removed.

          aws detective list-members \
              --graph-arn arn:aws:detective:us-east-1:111122223333:graph:123412341234

OUTPUT
       MemberDetails -> (list)
          The list of member accounts in the behavior graph.

          For  invited  accounts, the results include member accounts that did
          not pass verification and member accounts that have not yet accepted
          the  invitation  to  the  behavior graph. The results do not include
          member accounts that were removed from the behavior graph.

          For the organization behavior graph,  the  results  do  not  include
          organization  accounts  that the Detective administrator account has
          not enabled as member accounts.

          (structure)
              Details about a member account in a behavior graph.

              AccountId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account  identifier  for  the  member
                 account.

              EmailAddress -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web Services account root user email address for
                 the member account.

              GraphArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the behavior graph.

              MasterId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account identifier of the administra-
                 tor account for the behavior graph.

              AdministratorId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account identifier of the administra-
                 tor account for the behavior graph.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current membership status of the member account. The sta-
                 tus can have one of the following values:

                 o INVITED  -  For  invited  accounts only. Indicates that the
                   member was sent an invitation but has not yet responded.

                 o VERIFICATION_IN_PROGRESS - For invited accounts only, indi-
                   cates  that Detective is verifying that the account identi-
                   fier and email address  provided  for  the  member  account
                   match.  If  they do match, then Detective sends the invita-
                   tion. If the email address  and  account  identifier  don't
                   match,  then  the  member  cannot  be added to the behavior
                   graph. For organization accounts in the organization behav-
                   ior  graph,  indicates that Detective is verifying that the
                   account belongs to the organization.

                 o VERIFICATION_FAILED - For invited accounts only.  Indicates
                   that  the account and email address provided for the member
                   account do not match, and Detective did not send an invita-
                   tion to the account.

                 o ENABLED  - Indicates that the member account currently con-
                   tributes data to the behavior graph. For invited  accounts,
                   the  member  account accepted the invitation. For organiza-
                   tion accounts  in  the  organization  behavior  graph,  the
                   Detective  administrator  account  enabled the organization
                   account as a member account.

                 o ACCEPTED_BUT_DISABLED - The account  accepted  the  invita-
                   tion,   or  was  enabled  by  the  Detective  administrator
                   account, but is prevented from  contributing  data  to  the
                   behavior  graph. DisabledReason provides the reason why the
                   member account is not enabled.

                 Invited accounts that declined an  invitation  or  that  were
                 removed  from  the  behavior  graph  are not included. In the
                 organization behavior graph, organization accounts  that  the
                 Detective  administrator  account  did  not  enable  are  not
                 included.

              DisabledReason -> (string)
                 For member accounts with a status of ACCEPTED_BUT_DISABLED  ,
                 the reason that the member account is not enabled.

                 The reason can have one of the following values:

                 o VOLUME_TOO_HIGH  - Indicates that adding the member account
                   would cause the data volume for the behavior  graph  to  be
                   too high.

                 o VOLUME_UNKNOWN - Indicates that Detective is unable to ver-
                   ify the data volume for the member account. This is usually
                   because the member account is not enrolled in Amazon Guard-
                   Duty.

              InvitedTime -> (timestamp)
                 For invited accounts, the date and time that  Detective  sent
                 the  invitation  to the account. The value is an ISO8601 for-
                 matted string. For example, 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .

              UpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the member account was  last  updated.
                 The  value  is  an  ISO8601  formatted  string.  For example,
                 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .

              VolumeUsageInBytes -> (long)
                 The data volume in bytes per day for the member account.

              VolumeUsageUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The data and time when the member  account  data  volume  was
                 last  updated.  The value is an ISO8601 formatted string. For
                 example, 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .

              PercentOfGraphUtilization -> (double)
                 The member account data volume as a percentage of the maximum
                 allowed data volume. 0 indicates 0 percent, and 100 indicates
                 100 percent.

                 Note that this is not the percentage of  the  behavior  graph
                 data volume.

                 For  example, the data volume for the behavior graph is 80 GB
                 per day. The maximum data volume is 160 GB per  day.  If  the
                 data  volume  for  the  member account is 40 GB per day, then
                 PercentOfGraphUtilization is 25. It  represents  25%  of  the
                 maximum allowed data volume.

              PercentOfGraphUtilizationUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and time when the graph utilization percentage was
                 last updated. The value is an ISO8601 formatted  string.  For
                 example, 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .

              InvitationType -> (string)
                 The type of behavior graph membership.

                 For  an  organization  account  in  the organization behavior
                 graph, the type is ORGANIZATION .

                 For an account that was invited to a behavior graph, the type
                 is INVITATION .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If there are more member accounts remaining in the results, then use
          this pagination token to request the next page of member accounts.



                                                                LIST-MEMBERS()
