DESCRIPTION
       AWS  Single  Sign-On Portal is a web service that makes it easy for you
       to assign user access to AWS SSO resources such  as  the  user  portal.
       Users  can  get AWS account applications and roles assigned to them and
       get federated into the application.

       For general information about AWS SSO, see What is AWS Single  Sign-On?
       in the AWS SSO User Guide .

       This  API  reference guide describes the AWS SSO Portal operations that
       you can call programatically and includes detailed information on  data
       types and errors.

       NOTE:
          AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for var-
          ious programming languages and platforms, such as Java, Ruby,  .Net,
          iOS,  or  Android.  The SDKs provide a convenient way to create pro-
          grammatic access to AWS SSO and other AWS services. For more  infor-
          mation  about  the  AWS  SDKs, including how to download and install
          them, see Tools for Amazon Web Services .
