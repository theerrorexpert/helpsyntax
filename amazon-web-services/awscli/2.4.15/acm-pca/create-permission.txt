CREATE-PERMISSION()                                        CREATE-PERMISSION()



NAME
       create-permission -

DESCRIPTION
       Grants  one  or more permissions on a private CA to the AWS Certificate
       Manager (ACM) service principal (acm.amazonaws.com ). These permissions
       allow  ACM  to issue and renew ACM certificates that reside in the same
       AWS account as the CA.

       You can list current permissions with the  ListPermissions  action  and
       revoke them with the DeletePermission action.
          About Permissions

       o If  the  private CA and the certificates it issues reside in the same
         account, you can use CreatePermission to grant permissions for ACM to
         carry out automatic certificate renewals.

       o For automatic certificate renewal to succeed, the ACM service princi-
         pal needs permissions to create, retrieve, and list certificates.

       o If the private CA  and  the  ACM  certificates  reside  in  different
         accounts,  then  permissions  cannot  be  used  to  enable  automatic
         renewals.  Instead,  the  ACM  certificate  owner  must  set   up   a
         resource-based  policy to enable cross-account issuance and renewals.
         For more information, see Using a Resource Based Policy with ACM Pri-
         vate CA .

SYNOPSIS
            create-permission
          --certificate-authority-arn <value>
          --principal <value>
          [--source-account <value>]
          --actions <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-authority-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the CA that grants the permis-
          sions.    You    can    find    the    ARN    by     calling     the
          ListCertificateAuthorities  action.  This  must  have  the following
          form:

              ``
              arn:aws:acm-pca:region       :account       :certificate-author-
              ity/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 `` .

       --principal (string)
          The  AWS  service  or identity that receives the permission. At this
          time, the only valid principal is acm.amazonaws.com .

       --source-account (string)
          The ID of the calling account.

       --actions (list)
          The actions that the specified AWS service principal can use.  These
          include IssueCertificate , GetCertificate , and ListPermissions .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            IssueCertificate
            GetCertificate
            ListPermissions

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
