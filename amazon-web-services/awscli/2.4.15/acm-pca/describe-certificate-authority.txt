NAME
       describe-certificate-authority -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  information about your private certificate authority (CA) or one
       that has been shared with you. You specify the private CA on  input  by
       its  ARN (Amazon Resource Name). The output contains the status of your
       CA. This can be any of the following:

       o CREATING - ACM  Private  CA  is  creating  your  private  certificate
         authority.

       o PENDING_CERTIFICATE  -  The certificate is pending. You must use your
         ACM Private CA-hosted or on-premises root or subordinate CA  to  sign
         your private CA CSR and then import it into PCA.

       o ACTIVE - Your private CA is active.

       o DISABLED - Your private CA has been disabled.

       o EXPIRED - Your private CA certificate has expired.

       o FAILED  -  Your  private  CA  has failed. Your CA can fail because of
         problems such a network outage  or  back-end  AWS  failure  or  other
         errors.  A  failed CA can never return to the pending state. You must
         create a new CA.

       o DELETED - Your private CA is within  the  restoration  period,  after
         which  it is permanently deleted. The length of time remaining in the
         CA's restoration period is also included in this action's output.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-certificate-authority
          --certificate-authority-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-authority-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that was  returned  when  you  called
          CreateCertificateAuthority . This must be of the form:

              ``
              arn:aws:acm-pca:region       :account       :certificate-author-
              ity/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 `` .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                                   shortened  to  John.  Elizabeth  is   often
                                   shortened to Beth, Liz, or Eliza.

                               GenerationQualifier -> (string)
                                   Typically  a qualifier appended to the name
                                   of an individual. Examples include Jr.  for
                                   junior,  Sr. for senior, and III for third.

                            EdiPartyName -> (structure)
                               Represents  GeneralName  as   an   EdiPartyName
                               object.

                               PartyName -> (string)
                                   Specifies the party name.

                               NameAssigner -> (string)
                                   Specifies the name assigner.

                            UniformResourceIdentifier -> (string)
                               Represents GeneralName as a URI.

                            IpAddress -> (string)
                               Represents  GeneralName  as  an  IPv4  or  IPv6
                               address.

                            RegisteredId -> (string)
                               Represents GeneralName as an object  identifier
                               (OID).

          RevocationConfiguration -> (structure)
              Information  about the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)
              configuration or certificate revocation list (CRL)  created  and
              maintained by your private CA.

              CrlConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Configuration  of  the  certificate revocation list (CRL), if
                 any, maintained by  your  private  CA.  A  CRL  is  typically
                 updated  approximately  30  minutes  after  a  certificate is
                 revoked. If for any reason a CRL update fails, ACM Private CA
                 makes further attempts every 15 minutes.

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     Boolean  value that specifies whether certificate revoca-
                     tion lists (CRLs) are enabled. You can use this value  to
                     enable  certificate revocation for a new CA when you call
                     the CreateCertificateAuthority action or for an  existing
                     CA when you call the UpdateCertificateAuthority action.

                 ExpirationInDays -> (integer)
                     Validity period of the CRL in days.

                 CustomCname -> (string)
                     Name  inserted  into  the  certificate  CRL  Distribution
                     Points extension that enables the use of an alias for the
                     CRL  distribution point. Use this value if you don't want
                     the name of your S3 bucket to be public.

                 S3BucketName -> (string)
                     Name of the S3 bucket that contains the CRL.  If  you  do
                     not  provide  a  value  for the CustomCname argument, the
                     name of your S3 bucket is placed into the  CRL  Distribu-
                     tion  Points extension of the issued certificate. You can
                     change  the  name  of  your   bucket   by   calling   the
                     UpdateCertificateAuthority  operation. You must specify a
                     bucket policy that allows ACM Private CA to write the CRL
                     to your bucket.

                 S3ObjectAcl -> (string)
                     Determines  whether  the CRL will be publicly readable or
                     privately held in the CRL Amazon S3 bucket. If you choose
                     PUBLIC_READ,  the  CRL will be accessible over the public
                     internet. If you choose  BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL,  only
                     the  owner  of  the CRL S3 bucket can access the CRL, and
                     your PKI  clients  may  need  an  alternative  method  of
                     access.

                     If no value is specified, the default is PUBLIC_READ .
                        Note:  This  default  can cause CA creation to fail in
                        some circumstances. If you have have enabled the Block
                        Public  Access  (BPA) feature in your S3 account, then
                        you must  specify  the  value  of  this  parameter  as
                        BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL  ,  and not doing so results
                        in an error. If you have disabled BPA in S3, then  you
                        can  specify  either BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL or PUB-
                        LIC_READ as the value.

                     For more information, see Blocking public access  to  the
                     S3 bucket .

              OcspConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Configuration  of  Online  Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)
                 support, if any, maintained by  your  private  CA.  When  you
                 revoke  a  certificate, OCSP responses may take up to 60 min-
                 utes to reflect the new status.

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     Flag enabling use of the Online Certificate Status Proto-
                     col  (OCSP) for validating certificate revocation status.

                 OcspCustomCname -> (string)
                     By default, ACM Private CA injects  an  AWS  domain  into
                     certificates  being  validated  by the Online Certificate
                     Status Protocol (OCSP). A customer can alternatively  use
                     this  object  to  define  a CNAME specifying a customized
                     OCSP domain.

                     Note: The value of the CNAME must not include a  protocol
                     prefix such as "http://" or "https://".

                     For  more information, see Customizing Online Certificate
                     Status Protocol (OCSP) in  the  AWS  Certificate  Manager
                     Private Certificate Authority (PCA) User Guide .

          RestorableUntil -> (timestamp)
              The  period  during which a deleted CA can be restored. For more
              information, see the  PermanentDeletionTimeInDays  parameter  of
              the DeleteCertificateAuthorityRequest action.

          KeyStorageSecurityStandard -> (string)
              Defines  a cryptographic key management compliance standard used
              for handling CA keys.

              Default: FIPS_140_2_LEVEL_3_OR_HIGHER

              Note:    AWS     Region     ap-northeast-3     supports     only
              FIPS_140_2_LEVEL_2_OR_HIGHER.  You  must explicitly specify this
              parameter and value when creating a CA in that Region.  Specify-
              ing a different value (or no value) results in an InvalidArgsEx-
              ception with the message "A certificate authority cannot be cre-
              ated in this region with the specified security standard."
