GET-POLICY()                                                      GET-POLICY()



NAME
       get-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the resource-based policy attached to a private CA. If either
       the private CA resource or the policy  cannot  be  found,  this  action
       returns a ResourceNotFoundException .

       The  policy  can be attached or updated with PutPolicy and removed with
       DeletePolicy .
          About Policies

       o A policy grants access on a private CA to an AWS customer account, to
         AWS  Organizations,  or  to  an  AWS Organizations unit. Policies are
         under the control of a CA administrator. For  more  information,  see
         Using a Resource Based Policy with ACM Private CA .

       o A policy permits a user of AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to issue ACM
         certificates signed by a CA in another account.

       o For ACM to manage automatic renewal of these  certificates,  the  ACM
         user  must  configure a Service Linked Role (SLR). The SLR allows the
         ACM service to assume the identity of the user, subject to  confirma-
         tion  against  the  ACM  Private CA policy. For more information, see
         Using a Service Linked Role with ACM .

       o Updates made in AWS Resource Manager (RAM) are reflected in policies.
         For  more information, see Attach a Policy for Cross-Account Access .

SYNOPSIS
            get-policy
          --resource-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the private CA  that  will  have
          its  policy  retrieved.  You  can  find  the CA's ARN by calling the
          ListCertificateAuthorities action.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Policy -> (string)
          The policy attached to the private CA as a JSON document.
