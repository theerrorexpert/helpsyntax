NAME
       import-certificate-authority-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Imports  a  signed  private  CA  certificate  into ACM Private CA. This
       action is used when you are using  a  chain  of  trust  whose  root  is
       located  outside  ACM  Private CA. Before you can call this action, the
       following preparations must in place:

       o In ACM Private CA, call the CreateCertificateAuthority action to cre-
         ate  the  private CA that you plan to back with the imported certifi-
         cate.

       o Call the GetCertificateAuthorityCsr action to generate a  certificate
         signing request (CSR).

       o Sign  the  CSR  using  a  root or intermediate CA hosted by either an
         on-premises PKI hierarchy or by a commercial CA.

       o Create a certificate chain and copy the signed  certificate  and  the
         certificate chain to your working directory.

       ACM  Private  CA  supports three scenarios for installing a CA certifi-
       cate:

       o Installing a certificate for a root CA hosted by ACM Private CA.

       o Installing a subordinate CA certificate  whose  parent  authority  is
         hosted by ACM Private CA.

       o Installing  a  subordinate  CA  certificate whose parent authority is
         externally hosted.

       The following additional requirements apply when you import a  CA  cer-
       tificate.

       o Only a self-signed certificate can be imported as a root CA.

       o A self-signed certificate cannot be imported as a subordinate CA.

       o Your  certificate  chain  must not include the private CA certificate
         that you are importing.

       o Your root CA must be the last certificate in your chain. The subordi-
         nate  certificate,  if  any, that your root CA signed must be next to
         last. The subordinate certificate signed by the preceding subordinate
         CA must come next, and so on until your chain is built.

       o The chain must be PEM-encoded.

       o The maximum allowed size of a certificate is 32 KB.

       o The maximum allowed size of a certificate chain is 2 MB.
          Enforcement of Critical Constraints

       ACM Private CA allows the following extensions to be marked critical in
       the imported CA certificate or chain.

       o Basic constraints (must be marked critical)

       o Subject alternative names

       o Key usage

       o Extended key usage

       o Authority key identifier

       o Subject key identifier

       o Issuer alternative name

       o Subject directory attributes

       o Subject information access

       o Certificate policies

       o Policy mappings

       o Inhibit anyPolicy

       ACM Private CA rejects the following extensions when  they  are  marked
       critical in an imported CA certificate or chain.

       o Name constraints

       o Policy constraints

       o CRL distribution points

       o Authority information access

       o Freshest CRL

       o Any other extension

SYNOPSIS
            import-certificate-authority-certificate
          --certificate-authority-arn <value>
          --certificate <value>
          [--certificate-chain <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-authority-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) that was returned when you called
          CreateCertificateAuthority . This must be of the form:

              ``
              arn:aws:acm-pca:region       :account       :certificate-author-
              ity/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 ``

       --certificate (blob)
          The  PEM-encoded  certificate  for  a  private  CA.  This  may  be a
          self-signed certificate in the case of a  root  CA,  or  it  may  be
          signed by another CA that you control.

       --certificate-chain (blob)
          A  PEM-encoded  file  that  contains all of your certificates, other
          than the certificate you're importing, chaining up to your root  CA.
          Your  ACM  Private  CA-hosted or on-premises root certificate is the
          last in the chain, and each certificate in the chain signs  the  one
          preceding.

          This  parameter  must  be supplied when you import a subordinate CA.
          When you import a root CA, there is no chain.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To import your certificate authority certificate into ACM PCA

       The following import-certificate-authority-certificate command  imports
       the  signed private CA certificate for the CA specified by the ARN into
       ACM PCA.

          aws acm-pca import-certificate-authority-certificate --certificate-authority-arn arn:aws:acm-pca:us-west-2:123456789012:certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 --certificate fileb://C:\ca_cert.pem --certificate-chain fileb://C:\ca_cert_chain.pem

OUTPUT
       None
