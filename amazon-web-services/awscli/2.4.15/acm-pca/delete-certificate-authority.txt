DELETE-CERTIFICATE-AUTHORITY()                  DELETE-CERTIFICATE-AUTHORITY()



NAME
       delete-certificate-authority -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a private certificate authority (CA). You must provide the Ama-
       zon Resource Name (ARN) of the private CA that you want to delete.  You
       can find the ARN by calling the ListCertificateAuthorities action.

       NOTE:
          Deleting a CA will invalidate other CAs and certificates below it in
          your CA hierarchy.

       Before you can delete a CA that you have  created  and  activated,  you
       must disable it. To do this, call the UpdateCertificateAuthority action
       and set the CertificateAuthorityStatus parameter to DISABLED .

       Additionally, you can delete a CA if you are waiting for it to be  cre-
       ated  (that is, the status of the CA is CREATING ). You can also delete
       it if the CA has been created but you haven't yet imported  the  signed
       certificate into ACM Private CA (that is, the status of the CA is PEND-
       ING_CERTIFICATE ).

       When you successfully call DeleteCertificateAuthority , the CA's status
       changes to DELETED . However, the CA won't be permanently deleted until
       the restoration period has passed. By default, if you do  not  set  the
       PermanentDeletionTimeInDays parameter, the CA remains restorable for 30
       days.  You  can  set  the  parameter   from   7   to   30   days.   The
       DescribeCertificateAuthority  action  returns the time remaining in the
       restoration window of a private CA in the DELETED state. To restore  an
       eligible CA, call the RestoreCertificateAuthority action.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-certificate-authority
          --certificate-authority-arn <value>
          [--permanent-deletion-time-in-days <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-authority-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) that was returned when you called
          CreateCertificateAuthority . This must have the following form:

              ``
              arn:aws:acm-pca:region       :account       :certificate-author-
              ity/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 `` .

       --permanent-deletion-time-in-days (integer)
          The  number  of  days  to  make  a  CA  restorable after it has been
          deleted. This can be anywhere from 7 to 30 days, with 30  being  the
          default.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a private certificate authority

       The following delete-certificate-authority command deletes the certifi-
       cate authority identified by the ARN.

          aws acm-pca delete-certificate-authority --certificate-authority-arn arn:aws:acm-pca:us-west-2:123456789012:certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

OUTPUT
       None
