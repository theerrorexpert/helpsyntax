DELETE-POLICY()                                                DELETE-POLICY()



NAME
       delete-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the  resource-based  policy attached to a private CA. Deletion
       will remove any access that the policy has granted. If there is no pol-
       icy attached to the private CA, this action will return successful.

       If  you  delete  a  policy that was applied through AWS Resource Access
       Manager (RAM), the CA will be removed from all shares in which  it  was
       included.

       The  AWS  Certificate  Manager Service Linked Role that the policy sup-
       ports is not affected when you delete the policy.

       The current policy  can  be  shown  with  GetPolicy  and  updated  with
       PutPolicy .
          About Policies

       o A policy grants access on a private CA to an AWS customer account, to
         AWS Organizations, or to an  AWS  Organizations  unit.  Policies  are
         under  the  control  of a CA administrator. For more information, see
         Using a Resource Based Policy with ACM Private CA .

       o A policy permits a user of AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to issue ACM
         certificates signed by a CA in another account.

       o For  ACM  to  manage automatic renewal of these certificates, the ACM
         user must configure a Service Linked Role (SLR). The SLR  allows  the
         ACM  service to assume the identity of the user, subject to confirma-
         tion against the ACM Private CA policy.  For  more  information,  see
         Using a Service Linked Role with ACM .

       o Updates made in AWS Resource Manager (RAM) are reflected in policies.
         For more information, see Attach a Policy for Cross-Account Access  .

SYNOPSIS
            delete-policy
          --resource-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Number (ARN) of the private CA that will have
          its policy deleted. You  can  find  the  CA's  ARN  by  calling  the
          ListCertificateAuthorities  action. The ARN value must have the form
          arn:aws:acm-pca:region:account:certificate-author-
          ity/01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-0123456789ab .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
