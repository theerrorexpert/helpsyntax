UPDATE-CERTIFICATE-AUTHORITY()                  UPDATE-CERTIFICATE-AUTHORITY()



NAME
       update-certificate-authority -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the status or configuration of a private certificate authority
       (CA). Your private CA must be in the ACTIVE or  DISABLED  state  before
       you  can  update it. You can disable a private CA that is in the ACTIVE
       state or make a CA that is in the DISABLED state active again.

       NOTE:
          Both PCA and the IAM principal must have permission to write to  the
          S3  bucket  that  you  specify. If the IAM principal making the call
          does not have permission to write to the bucket, then  an  exception
          is thrown. For more information, see Configure Access to ACM Private
          CA .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-certificate-authority
          --certificate-authority-arn <value>
          [--revocation-configuration <value>]
          [--status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-authority-arn (string)
          Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the private CA that  issued  the  cer-
          tificate to be revoked. This must be of the form:

              ``
              arn:aws:acm-pca:region       :account       :certificate-author-
              ity/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 ``

       --revocation-configuration (structure)
          Contains information to enable Online  Certificate  Status  Protocol
          (OCSP)  support,  to  enable a certificate revocation list (CRL), to
          enable both, or to enable neither. If this  parameter  is  not  sup-
          plied,  existing capibilites remain unchanged. For more information,
          see the OcspConfiguration and CrlConfiguration types.

          CrlConfiguration -> (structure)
              Configuration of the certificate revocation list (CRL), if  any,
              maintained  by  your  private  CA.  A  CRL  is typically updated
              approximately 30 minutes after a certificate is revoked. If  for
              any  reason  a  CRL  update  fails, ACM Private CA makes further
              attempts every 15 minutes.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Boolean value that specifies whether  certificate  revocation
                 lists  (CRLs)  are  enabled. You can use this value to enable
                 certificate revocation  for  a  new  CA  when  you  call  the
                 CreateCertificateAuthority  action or for an existing CA when
                 you call the UpdateCertificateAuthority action.

              ExpirationInDays -> (integer)
                 Validity period of the CRL in days.

              CustomCname -> (string)
                 Name inserted into the certificate  CRL  Distribution  Points
                 extension  that  enables the use of an alias for the CRL dis-
                 tribution point. Use this value if you don't want the name of
                 your S3 bucket to be public.

              S3BucketName -> (string)
                 Name  of  the  S3 bucket that contains the CRL. If you do not
                 provide a value for the CustomCname  argument,  the  name  of
                 your  S3  bucket  is  placed into the CRL Distribution Points
                 extension of the issued certificate. You can change the  name
                 of  your  bucket  by  calling  the UpdateCertificateAuthority
                 operation. You must specify a bucket policy that  allows  ACM
                 Private CA to write the CRL to your bucket.

              S3ObjectAcl -> (string)
                 Determines  whether the CRL will be publicly readable or pri-
                 vately held in the CRL Amazon S3 bucket. If you  choose  PUB-
                 LIC_READ,  the  CRL will be accessible over the public inter-
                 net. If you choose BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL, only the  owner
                 of the CRL S3 bucket can access the CRL, and your PKI clients
                 may need an alternative method of access.

                 If no value is specified, the default is PUBLIC_READ .
                     Note: This default can cause CA creation to fail in  some
                     circumstances.  If you have have enabled the Block Public
                     Access (BPA) feature in your S3 account,  then  you  must
                     specify     the    value    of    this    parameter    as
                     BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL , and not doing so  results  in
                     an  error.  If  you have disabled BPA in S3, then you can
                     specify either BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL  or  PUBLIC_READ
                     as the value.

                 For  more  information,  see Blocking public access to the S3
                 bucket .

          OcspConfiguration -> (structure)
              Configuration of Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)  sup-
              port,  if  any, maintained by your private CA. When you revoke a
              certificate, OCSP responses may take up to 60 minutes to reflect
              the new status.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Flag  enabling  use of the Online Certificate Status Protocol
                 (OCSP) for validating certificate revocation status.

              OcspCustomCname -> (string)
                 By default, ACM Private CA injects an AWS  domain  into  cer-
                 tificates  being  validated  by the Online Certificate Status
                 Protocol (OCSP). A customer can alternatively use this object
                 to define a CNAME specifying a customized OCSP domain.

                 Note: The value of the CNAME must not include a protocol pre-
                 fix such as "http://" or "https://".

                 For more information, see Customizing Online Certificate Sta-
                 tus  Protocol  (OCSP)  in the AWS Certificate Manager Private
                 Certificate Authority (PCA) User Guide .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CrlConfiguration={Enabled=boolean,ExpirationInDays=integer,CustomCname=string,S3BucketName=string,S3ObjectAcl=string},OcspConfiguration={Enabled=boolean,OcspCustomCname=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CrlConfiguration": {
              "Enabled": true|false,
              "ExpirationInDays": integer,
              "CustomCname": "string",
              "S3BucketName": "string",
              "S3ObjectAcl": "PUBLIC_READ"|"BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL"
            },
            "OcspConfiguration": {
              "Enabled": true|false,
              "OcspCustomCname": "string"
            }
          }

       --status (string)
          Status of your private CA.

          Possible values:

          o CREATING

          o PENDING_CERTIFICATE

          o ACTIVE

          o DELETED

          o DISABLED

          o EXPIRED

          o FAILED

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
