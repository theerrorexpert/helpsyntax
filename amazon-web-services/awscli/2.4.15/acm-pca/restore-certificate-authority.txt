RESTORE-CERTIFICATE-AUTHORITY()                RESTORE-CERTIFICATE-AUTHORITY()



NAME
       restore-certificate-authority -

DESCRIPTION
       Restores a certificate authority (CA) that is in the DELETED state. You
       can restore a CA during the period that you defined in  the  Permanent-
       DeletionTimeInDays  parameter of the DeleteCertificateAuthority action.
       Currently, you can specify 7 to 30 days. If you did not specify a  Per-
       manentDeletionTimeInDays  value,  by  default you can restore the CA at
       any time in a 30 day period. You can check the time  remaining  in  the
       restoration  period of a private CA in the DELETED state by calling the
       DescribeCertificateAuthority or ListCertificateAuthorities actions. The
       status  of  a  restored  CA  is set to its pre-deletion status when the
       RestoreCertificateAuthority action returns. To  change  its  status  to
       ACTIVE  , call the UpdateCertificateAuthority action. If the private CA
       was in the PENDING_CERTIFICATE state at  deletion,  you  must  use  the
       ImportCertificateAuthorityCertificate  action  to  import a certificate
       authority into the private CA before it can be  activated.  You  cannot
       restore a CA after the restoration period has ended.

SYNOPSIS
            restore-certificate-authority
          --certificate-authority-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-authority-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that was returned when you called the
          CreateCertificateAuthority action. This must be of the form:

              ``
              arn:aws:acm-pca:region       :account       :certificate-author-
              ity/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 ``

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
