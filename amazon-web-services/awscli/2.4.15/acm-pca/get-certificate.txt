GET-CERTIFICATE()                                            GET-CERTIFICATE()



NAME
       get-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  certificate  from  your  private  CA or one that has been
       shared with you. The ARN of the certificate is returned when  you  call
       the IssueCertificate action. You must specify both the ARN of your pri-
       vate CA and the ARN of the issued certificate when calling the  GetCer-
       tificate  action.  You  can  retrieve  the  certificate if it is in the
       ISSUED state. You can  call  the  CreateCertificateAuthorityAuditReport
       action  to  create  a report that contains information about all of the
       certificates issued and revoked by your private CA.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-certificate
          --certificate-authority-arn <value>
          --certificate-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-authority-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that was  returned  when  you  called
          CreateCertificateAuthority . This must be of the form:

              ``
              arn:aws:acm-pca:region       :account       :certificate-author-
              ity/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 `` .

       --certificate-arn (string)
          The ARN of the issued certificate. The ARN contains the  certificate
          serial number and must be in the following form:

              ``
              arn:aws:acm-pca:region       :account       :certificate-author-
              ity/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012               /certifi-
              cate/286535153982981100925020015808220737245 ``

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve an issued certificate

       The  following get-certificate example retrieves a certificate from the
       specified private CA.

          aws acm-pca get-certificate \
              --certificate-authority-arn arn:aws:acm-pca:us-west-2:123456789012:certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 \
              --certificate-arn arn:aws:acm-pca:us-west-2:123456789012:certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012/certificate/6707447683a9b7f4055627ffd55cebcc \
              --output text

       Output:

       The first part of the output is the certificate itself. The second part
       is  the  certificate chain that chains to the root CA certificate. Note
       that when you use the --output text option, a TAB character is inserted
       between  the  two certificate pieces (that is the cause of the indented
       text). If you intend to take this output  and  parse  the  certificates
       with  other  tools, you might need to remove the TAB character so it is
       processed correctly.

OUTPUT
       Certificate -> (string)
          The base64 PEM-encoded certificate specified by  the  CertificateArn
          parameter.

       CertificateChain -> (string)
          The  base64 PEM-encoded certificate chain that chains up to the root
          CA certificate that you used to sign your private CA certificate.
