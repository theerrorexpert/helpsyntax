DELETE-PERMISSION()                                        DELETE-PERMISSION()



NAME
       delete-permission -

DESCRIPTION
       Revokes permissions on a private CA granted to the AWS Certificate Man-
       ager (ACM) service principal (acm.amazonaws.com).

       These permissions allow ACM to issue and renew  ACM  certificates  that
       reside  in  the same AWS account as the CA. If you revoke these permis-
       sions, ACM will no longer renew  the  affected  certificates  automati-
       cally.

       Permissions  can be granted with the CreatePermission action and listed
       with the ListPermissions action.
          About Permissions

       o If the private CA and the certificates it issues reside in  the  same
         account, you can use CreatePermission to grant permissions for ACM to
         carry out automatic certificate renewals.

       o For automatic certificate renewal to succeed, the ACM service princi-
         pal needs permissions to create, retrieve, and list certificates.

       o If  the  private  CA  and  the  ACM  certificates reside in different
         accounts,  then  permissions  cannot  be  used  to  enable  automatic
         renewals.   Instead,   the  ACM  certificate  owner  must  set  up  a
         resource-based policy to enable cross-account issuance and  renewals.
         For more information, see Using a Resource Based Policy with ACM Pri-
         vate CA .

SYNOPSIS
            delete-permission
          --certificate-authority-arn <value>
          --principal <value>
          [--source-account <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-authority-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the private CA that  issued  the
          permissions.   You   can   find   the   CA's   ARN  by  calling  the
          ListCertificateAuthorities action.  This  must  have  the  following
          form:

              ``
              arn:aws:acm-pca:region       :account       :certificate-author-
              ity/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 `` .

       --principal (string)
          The AWS service or  identity  that  will  have  its  CA  permissions
          revoked.  At this time, the only valid service principal is acm.ama-
          zonaws.com

       --source-account (string)
          The AWS account that calls this action.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
