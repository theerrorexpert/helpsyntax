LIST-CERTIFICATE-AUTHORITIES()                  LIST-CERTIFICATE-AUTHORITIES()



NAME
       list-certificate-authorities -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the private certificate authorities that you created by using the
       CreateCertificateAuthority action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-certificate-authorities is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: CertificateAuthorities

SYNOPSIS
            list-certificate-authorities
          [--resource-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-owner (string)
          Use this parameter to filter the returned set of certificate author-
          ities based on their owner. The default is SELF.

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o OTHER_ACCOUNTS

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list your private certificate authorities

       The  following  list-certificate-authorities  command lists information
       about all of the private CAs in your account.

          aws acm-pca list-certificate-authorities --max-results 10

OUTPUT
       CertificateAuthorities -> (list)
          Summary information about each certificate authority you  have  cre-
          ated.

          (structure)
              Contains  information  about  your private certificate authority
              (CA). Your private CA can issue and revoke  X.509  digital  cer-
              tificates.  Digital certificates verify that the entity named in
              the certificate Subject field owns or controls  the  public  key
              contained  in  the  Subject  Public  Key  Info  field.  Call the
              CreateCertificateAuthority action to create your private CA. You
              must  then call the GetCertificateAuthorityCertificate action to
              retrieve a private CA certificate signing  request  (CSR).  Sign
              the  CSR  with your ACM Private CA-hosted or on-premises root or
              subordinate        CA        certificate.        Call        the
              ImportCertificateAuthorityCertificate   action   to  import  the
              signed certificate into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).

              Arn -> (string)
                 Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)  for  your  private  certificate
                 authority       (CA).       The       format       is      ``
                 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 `` .

              OwnerAccount -> (string)
                 The AWS account ID that owns the certificate authority.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 Date and time at which your private CA was created.

              LastStateChangeAt -> (timestamp)
                 Date and time at which your private CA was last updated.

              Type -> (string)
                 Type of your private CA.

              Serial -> (string)
                 Serial number of your private CA.

              Status -> (string)
                 Status of your private CA.

              NotBefore -> (timestamp)
                 Date and time before which your private CA certificate is not
                 valid.

              NotAfter -> (timestamp)
                 Date  and time after which your private CA certificate is not
                 valid.

              FailureReason -> (string)
                 Reason the request to create your private CA failed.

              CertificateAuthorityConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Your private CA configuration.

                 KeyAlgorithm -> (string)

                     the  key  pair that your CA creates when it issues a cer-
                     tificate. When you create a subordinate CA, you must  use
                     a key algorithm supported by the parent CA.

                 SigningAlgorithm -> (string)
                     Name  of  the algorithm your private CA uses to sign cer-
                     tificate requests.

                     This parameter should not be confused with the SigningAl-
                     gorithm parameter used to sign certificates when they are
                     issued.

                                      private PKI, the common name (CN) can be
                                      any string within the length limit.

                                      Note: In publicly trusted  certificates,
                                      the  common  name must be a fully quali-
                                      fied domain name (FQDN) associated  with
                                      the certificate subject.

                                      Family  name.  In the US and the UK, for
                                      example, the surname of an individual is
                                      ordered last. In Asian cultures the sur-
                                      name is typically ordered first.

                                      name .

                                   Pseudonym -> (string)
                                      Typically  a  shortened  version  of   a
                                      longer GivenName . For example, Jonathan
                                      is often shortened to John. Elizabeth is
                                      often  shortened to Beth, Liz, or Eliza.

                                   GenerationQualifier -> (string)
                                      Typically a qualifier  appended  to  the
                                      name  of an individual. Examples include
                                      Jr. for junior, Sr. for senior, and  III
                                      for third.

                               EdiPartyName -> (structure)
                                   Represents  GeneralName  as an EdiPartyName
                                   object.

                                   PartyName -> (string)

                               IpAddress -> (string)
                                   Represents GeneralName as an IPv4  or  IPv6
                                   address.

                               RegisteredId -> (string)
                                   Represents GeneralName as an object identi-
                                   fier (OID).

              RevocationConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Information about  the  Online  Certificate  Status  Protocol
                 (OCSP)  configuration  or  certificate  revocation list (CRL)
                 created and maintained by your private CA.

                 CrlConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Configuration of the certificate revocation  list  (CRL),
                     if any, maintained by your private CA. A CRL is typically
                     updated approximately 30 minutes after a  certificate  is
                     revoked.  If  for any reason a CRL update fails, ACM Pri-
                     vate CA makes further attempts every 15 minutes.

                     Enabled -> (boolean)
                        Boolean value that specifies whether certificate revo-
                        cation  lists  (CRLs)  are  enabled.  You can use this
                        value to enable certificate revocation for  a  new  CA
                        when you call the CreateCertificateAuthority action or
                        for   an   existing   CA    when    you    call    the
                        UpdateCertificateAuthority action.

                     ExpirationInDays -> (integer)
                        Validity period of the CRL in days.

                     CustomCname -> (string)
                        Name  inserted  into  the certificate CRL Distribution
                        Points extension that enables the use of an alias  for
                        the  CRL  distribution  point.  Use  this value if you
                        don't want the name of your S3 bucket to be public.

                     S3BucketName -> (string)
                        Name of the S3 bucket that contains the CRL. If you do
                        not  provide a value for the CustomCname argument, the
                        name of your S3 bucket is placed into the CRL  Distri-
                        bution Points extension of the issued certificate. You
                        can change the name of  your  bucket  by  calling  the
                        UpdateCertificateAuthority operation. You must specify
                        a bucket policy that allows ACM Private  CA  to  write
                        the CRL to your bucket.

                     S3ObjectAcl -> (string)
                        Determines  whether  the CRL will be publicly readable
                        or privately held in the CRL Amazon S3 bucket. If  you
                        choose  PUBLIC_READ,  the  CRL will be accessible over
                        the     public     internet.     If     you     choose
                        BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL,  only  the owner of the CRL
                        S3 bucket can access the CRL, and your PKI clients may
                        need an alternative method of access.

                        If no value is specified, the default is PUBLIC_READ .
                            Note: This default can cause CA creation  to  fail
                            in  some  circumstances.  If you have have enabled
                            the Block Public Access (BPA) feature in  your  S3
                            account,  then  you must specify the value of this
                            parameter as BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL ,  and  not
                            doing so results in an error. If you have disabled
                            BPA  in  S3,   then   you   can   specify   either
                            BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL  or  PUBLIC_READ  as the
                            value.

                        the S3 bucket .

                 OcspConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Configuration   of  Online  Certificate  Status  Protocol
                     (OCSP) support, if any, maintained by  your  private  CA.
                     When you revoke a certificate, OCSP responses may take up
                     to 60 minutes to reflect the new status.

                     Enabled -> (boolean)
                        Flag enabling use of  the  Online  Certificate  Status
                        Protocol  (OCSP) for validating certificate revocation
                        status.

                     OcspCustomCname -> (string)
                        By default, ACM Private CA injects an AWS domain  into
                        certificates being validated by the Online Certificate
                        Status Protocol (OCSP). A customer  can  alternatively
                        use  this  object  to define a CNAME specifying a cus-
                        tomized OCSP domain.

                        Note: The value of the CNAME must not include a proto-
                        col prefix such as "http://" or "https://".

                        .

              RestorableUntil -> (timestamp)
                 The period during which a deleted CA  can  be  restored.  For
                 more information, see the PermanentDeletionTimeInDays parame-
                 ter of the DeleteCertificateAuthorityRequest action.

              KeyStorageSecurityStandard -> (string)
                 Defines a cryptographic key  management  compliance  standard
                 used for handling CA keys.

                 Default: FIPS_140_2_LEVEL_3_OR_HIGHER

                 Note:     AWS    Region    ap-northeast-3    supports    only
                 FIPS_140_2_LEVEL_2_OR_HIGHER.  You  must  explicitly  specify
                 this  parameter  and value when creating a CA in that Region.
                 Specifying a different value (or  no  value)  results  in  an
                 InvalidArgsException  with the message "A certificate author-
                 ity cannot be created in this region with the specified secu-
                 rity standard."

       NextToken -> (string)
          When the list is truncated, this value is present and should be used
          for the NextToken parameter in a subsequent pagination request.
