PUT-POLICY()                                                      PUT-POLICY()



NAME
       put-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Attaches a resource-based policy to a private CA.

       A  policy  can  also  be  applied  by  sharing a private CA through AWS
       Resource Access Manager (RAM). For more information, see Attach a  Pol-
       icy for Cross-Account Access .

       The   policy   can   be  displayed  with  GetPolicy  and  removed  with
       DeletePolicy .
          About Policies

       o A policy grants access on a private CA to an AWS customer account, to
         AWS  Organizations,  or  to  an  AWS Organizations unit. Policies are
         under the control of a CA administrator. For  more  information,  see
         Using a Resource Based Policy with ACM Private CA .

       o A policy permits a user of AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to issue ACM
         certificates signed by a CA in another account.

       o For ACM to manage automatic renewal of these  certificates,  the  ACM
         user  must  configure a Service Linked Role (SLR). The SLR allows the
         ACM service to assume the identity of the user, subject to  confirma-
         tion  against  the  ACM  Private CA policy. For more information, see
         Using a Service Linked Role with ACM .

       o Updates made in AWS Resource Manager (RAM) are reflected in policies.
         For  more information, see Attach a Policy for Cross-Account Access .

SYNOPSIS
            put-policy
          --resource-arn <value>
          --policy <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the private CA to associate with
          the  policy.  The  ARN  of  the  CA  can  be  found  by  calling the
          ListCertificateAuthorities action.

       --policy (string)
          The path and file name of a JSON-formatted IAM policy to  attach  to
          the  specified  private CA resource. If this policy does not contain
          all required statements or if it includes any statement that is  not
          allowed,  the  PutPolicy  action returns an InvalidPolicyException .
          For information  about  IAM  policy  and  statement  structure,  see
          Overview of JSON Policies .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
