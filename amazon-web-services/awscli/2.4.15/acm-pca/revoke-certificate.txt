REVOKE-CERTIFICATE()                                      REVOKE-CERTIFICATE()



NAME
       revoke-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Revokes  a  certificate  that  was issued inside ACM Private CA. If you
       enable a certificate revocation list (CRL) when you  create  or  update
       your  private  CA,  information  about the revoked certificates will be
       included in the CRL. ACM Private CA writes the CRL to an S3 bucket that
       you  specify. A CRL is typically updated approximately 30 minutes after
       a certificate is revoked. If for any reason the CRL update  fails,  ACM
       Private  CA attempts makes further attempts every 15 minutes. With Ama-
       zon CloudWatch, you can create alarms for the metrics CRLGenerated  and
       MisconfiguredCRLBucket . For more information, see Supported CloudWatch
       Metrics .

       NOTE:
          Both PCA and the IAM principal must have permission to write to  the
          S3  bucket  that  you  specify. If the IAM principal making the call
          does not have permission to write to the bucket, then  an  exception
          is thrown. For more information, see Configure Access to ACM Private
          CA .

       ACM Private CA also writes revocation information to the audit  report.
       For more information, see CreateCertificateAuthorityAuditReport .

       NOTE:
          You cannot revoke a root CA self-signed certificate.

SYNOPSIS
            revoke-certificate
          --certificate-authority-arn <value>
          --certificate-serial <value>
          --revocation-reason <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-authority-arn (string)
          Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the private CA that issued the cer-
          tificate to be revoked. This must be of the form:

              ``
              arn:aws:acm-pca:region       :account       :certificate-author-
              ity/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 ``

       --certificate-serial (string)
          Serial  number  of  the  certificate  to be revoked. This must be in
          hexadecimal format. You can retrieve the serial  number  by  calling
          GetCertificate  with  the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the certifi-
          cate you want and the ARN of your  private  CA.  The  GetCertificate
          action  retrieves the certificate in the PEM format. You can use the
          following OpenSSL command to list the certificate in text format and
          copy the hexadecimal serial number.
              openssl x509 -in *file_path* -text -noout

          You  can  also  copy  the  serial number from the console or use the
          DescribeCertificate action in the AWS Certificate Manager API Refer-
          ence .

       --revocation-reason (string)
          Specifies why you revoked the certificate.

          Possible values:

          o UNSPECIFIED

          o KEY_COMPROMISE

          o CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY_COMPROMISE

          o AFFILIATION_CHANGED

          o SUPERSEDED

          o CESSATION_OF_OPERATION

          o PRIVILEGE_WITHDRAWN

          o A_A_COMPROMISE

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To revoke a private certificate

       The  following revoke-certificate command revokes a private certificate
       from the CA identified by the ARN.

          aws acm-pca revoke-certificate --certificate-authority-arn arn:aws:acm-pca:us-west-2:1234567890:certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 --certificate-serial 67:07:44:76:83:a9:b7:f4:05:56:27:ff:d5:5c:eb:cc --revocation-reason "KEY_COMPROMISE"

OUTPUT
       None
