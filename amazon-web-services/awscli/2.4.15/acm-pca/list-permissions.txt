LIST-PERMISSIONS()                                          LIST-PERMISSIONS()



NAME
       list-permissions -

DESCRIPTION
       List  all  permissions on a private CA, if any, granted to the AWS Cer-
       tificate Manager (ACM) service principal (acm.amazonaws.com).

       These permissions allow ACM to issue and renew  ACM  certificates  that
       reside in the same AWS account as the CA.

       Permissions can be granted with the CreatePermission action and revoked
       with the DeletePermission action.
          About Permissions

       o If the private CA and the certificates it issues reside in  the  same
         account, you can use CreatePermission to grant permissions for ACM to
         carry out automatic certificate renewals.

       o For automatic certificate renewal to succeed, the ACM service princi-
         pal needs permissions to create, retrieve, and list certificates.

       o If  the  private  CA  and  the  ACM  certificates reside in different
         accounts,  then  permissions  cannot  be  used  to  enable  automatic
         renewals.   Instead,   the  ACM  certificate  owner  must  set  up  a
         resource-based policy to enable cross-account issuance and  renewals.
         For more information, see Using a Resource Based Policy with ACM Pri-
         vate CA .

       list-permissions is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Permissions

SYNOPSIS
            list-permissions
          --certificate-authority-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-authority-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Number (ARN) of the private CA to inspect. You
          can find the ARN by calling the  ListCertificateAuthorities  action.
          This  must  be  of the form: arn:aws:acm-pca:region:account:certifi-
          cate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 You  can  get  a
          private CA's ARN by running the ListCertificateAuthorities action.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Permissions -> (list)
          Summary information about each permission assigned by the  specified
          private  CA,  including the action enabled, the policy provided, and
          the time of creation.

          (structure)
              Permissions designate which private CA actions can be  performed
              by  an  AWS service or entity. In order for ACM to automatically
              renew private certificates, you must give the ACM service  prin-
              cipal  all available permissions (IssueCertificate , GetCertifi-
              cate , and ListPermissions ). Permissions can be  assigned  with
              the  CreatePermission  action, removed with the DeletePermission
              action, and listed with the ListPermissions action.

              CertificateAuthorityArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the private CA from which
                 the permission was issued.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the permission was created.

              Principal -> (string)
                 The  AWS service or entity that holds the permission. At this
                 time, the only valid principal is acm.amazonaws.com .

              SourceAccount -> (string)
                 The ID of the account that assigned the permission.

              Actions -> (list)
                 The private CA actions that can be performed  by  the  desig-
                 nated AWS service.

                 (string)

              Policy -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the policy that is associated with the permis-
                 sion.

       NextToken -> (string)
          When the list is truncated, this value is present and should be used
          for the NextToken parameter in a subsequent pagination request.



                                                            LIST-PERMISSIONS()
