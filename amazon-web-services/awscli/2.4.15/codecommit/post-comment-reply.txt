       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            post-comment-reply
          --in-reply-to <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          --content <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --in-reply-to (string)
          The system-generated ID of the comment to which you want  to  reply.
          To  get  this ID, use  GetCommentsForComparedCommit or  GetComments-
          ForPullRequest .

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique, client-generated idempotency token that, when provided  in
          a  request,  ensures  the  request cannot be repeated with a changed
          parameter. If a request is received with the same parameters  and  a
          token is included, the request returns information about the initial
          request that used that token.

       --content (string)
          The contents of your reply to a comment.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
