GET-REPOSITORY-TRIGGERS()                            GET-REPOSITORY-TRIGGERS()



NAME
       get-repository-triggers -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about triggers configured for a repository.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-repository-triggers
          --repository-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository for which the trigger is configured.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about triggers in a repository

       This  example  shows details about triggers configured for an AWS Code-
       Commit repository named MyDemoRepo.

          aws codecommit get-repository-triggers \
              --repository-name MyDemoRepo

       Output:

          {
              "configurationId": "f7579e13-b83e-4027-aaef-650c0EXAMPLE",
              "triggers": [
                  {
                      "destinationArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:111111111111:MyCodeCommitTopic",
                      "branches": [
                          "main",
                          "preprod"
                      ],
                      "name": "MyFirstTrigger",
                      "customData": "",
                      "events": [
                          "all"
                      ]
                  },
                  {
                      "destinationArn": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:111111111111:function:MyCodeCommitPythonFunction",
                      "branches": [],
                      "name": "MySecondTrigger",
                      "customData": "EXAMPLE",
                      "events": [
                          "all"
                      ]
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       configurationId -> (string)
          The system-generated unique ID for the trigger.

       triggers -> (list)
          The JSON block of configuration information for each trigger.

          (structure)
              Information about a trigger for a repository.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the trigger.

              destinationArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the resource that is the target for a trigger (for
                 example, the ARN of a topic in Amazon SNS).

              customData -> (string)
                 Any custom data associated with the trigger to be included in
                 the information sent to the target of the trigger.

              branches -> (list)
                 The branches to be included in the trigger configuration.  If
                 you  specify  an  empty  array,  the  trigger  applies to all
                 branches.

                 NOTE:
                     Although no content is required in the  array,  you  must
                     include the array itself.

                 (string)

              events -> (list)
                 The  repository  events that cause the trigger to run actions
                 in another service, such as sending  a  notification  through
                 Amazon SNS.

                 NOTE:
                     The  valid value "all" cannot be used with any other val-
                     ues.

                 (string)
