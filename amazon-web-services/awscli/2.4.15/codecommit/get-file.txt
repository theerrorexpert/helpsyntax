GET-FILE()                                                          GET-FILE()



NAME
       get-file -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the base-64 encoded contents of a specified file and its meta-
       data.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-file
          --repository-name <value>
          [--commit-specifier <value>]
          --file-path <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository that contains the file.

       --commit-specifier (string)
          The fully quaified reference that identifies the  commit  that  con-
          tains  the  file.  For  example, you can specify a full commit ID, a
          tag, a branch name, or a reference  such  as  refs/heads/master.  If
          none is provided, the head commit is used.

       --file-path (string)
          The  fully  qualified  path to the file, including the full name and
          extension of the file. For example, /examples/file.md is  the  fully
          qualified path to a file named file.md in a folder named examples.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To  get  the  base-64  encoded  contents of a file in an AWS CodeCommit
       repository

       The following get-file example demonstrates  how  to  get  the  base-64
       encoded  contents of a file named README.md from a branch named main in
       a repository named MyDemoRepo.

          aws codecommit get-file \
              --repository-name MyDemoRepo \
              --commit-specifier main \
              --file-path README.md

       Output:

          {
              "blobId":"559b44fEXAMPLE",
              "commitId":"c5709475EXAMPLE",
              "fileContent":"IyBQaHVzEXAMPLE",
              "filePath":"README.md",
              "fileMode":"NORMAL",
              "fileSize":1563
          }

       For more information, see GetFile in the AWS CodeCommit  API  Reference
       guide.

OUTPUT
       commitId -> (string)
          The  full commit ID of the commit that contains the content returned
          by GetFile.

       blobId -> (string)
          The blob ID of the object that represents the file content.

       filePath -> (string)
          The fully qualified path to the specified file. Returns the name and
          extension of the file.

       fileMode -> (string)
          The  extrapolated  file  mode  permissions of the blob. Valid values
          include strings such as EXECUTABLE and not numeric values.

          NOTE:
              The file mode permissions returned by this API are not the stan-
              dard  file  mode  permission  values, such as 100644, but rather
              extrapolated values. See the supported return values.

       fileSize -> (long)
          The size of the contents of the file, in bytes.

       fileContent -> (blob)
          The base-64 encoded binary data object that represents  the  content
          of the file.
