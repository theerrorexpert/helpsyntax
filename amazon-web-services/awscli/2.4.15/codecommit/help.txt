DESCRIPTION
       This  is  the  AWS  CodeCommit  API Reference . This reference provides
       descriptions of the operations and data types for  AWS  CodeCommit  API
       along with usage examples.

       You can use the AWS CodeCommit API to work with the following objects:

       Repositories, by calling the following:

       o BatchGetRepositories  ,  which  returns information about one or more
         repositories associated with your AWS account.

         of the repository.

       o UpdateRepositoryName  ,  which changes the name of the repository. If
         you change the name of a repository, no other users of  that  reposi-

       o UpdatePullRequestStatus , which updates the status of a pull request.

       o UpdatePullRequestTitle , which updates the title of a pull request.

       Approval rule templates, by calling the following:

       o AssociateApprovalRuleTemplateWithRepository , which associates a tem-
         plate with a specified repository. After the template  is  associated
         with  a  repository, AWS CodeCommit creates approval rules that match
         the template conditions on every pull request created in  the  speci-
         fied repository.

       o BatchAssociateApprovalRuleTemplateWithRepositories , which associates
         a template with one or more specified repositories.  After  the  tem-
         plate  is  associated  with  a  repository,  AWS  CodeCommit  creates
         approval rules that match  the  template  conditions  on  every  pull
         request created in the specified repositories.

       o BatchDisassociateApprovalRuleTemplateFromRepositories , which removes
         the association between a template and specified repositories so that
         approval  rules  based  on the template are not automatically created
         when pull requests are created in those repositories.

       o CreateApprovalRuleTemplate , which creates a  template  for  approval
         rules  that  can  then be associated with one or more repositories in
         your AWS account.

       o DeleteApprovalRuleTemplate , which deletes the specified template. It
         does  not remove approval rules on pull requests already created with
         the template.

       o DisassociateApprovalRuleTemplateFromRepository ,  which  removes  the
         association  between  a  template  and  a repository so that approval
         rules based on the template are not automatically created  when  pull
         requests are created in the specified repository.

       o GetApprovalRuleTemplate , which returns information about an approval
         rule template.

       o ListApprovalRuleTemplates , which lists all approval  rule  templates
         in the AWS Region in your AWS account.

       o ListAssociatedApprovalRuleTemplatesForRepository  ,  which  lists all
         approval rule templates that are associated with a specified  reposi-
         tory.

         ries associated with the specified approval rule template.

         of an approval rule template.

         approval rule template.

       o UpdateApprovalRuleTemplateContent , which updates the content  of  an
         approval rule template.

       Comments in a repository, by calling the following:

       o DeleteCommentContent  ,  which  deletes the content of a comment on a
         commit in a repository.

       o GetComment , which returns information about a comment on a commit.

       o GetCommentReactions , which returns information about emoji reactions
         to comments.

       o GetCommentsForComparedCommit  ,  which returns information about com-
         ments on the comparison between two commit specifiers  in  a  reposi-
         tory.

       o PostCommentForComparedCommit , which creates a comment on the compar-
         ison between two commit specifiers in a repository.

       o PostCommentReply , which creates a reply to a comment.

       o PutCommentReaction , which creates or updates an emoji reaction to  a
         comment.

       o UpdateComment , which updates the content of a comment on a commit in
         a repository.

       Tags used to tag resources in AWS CodeCommit (not Git tags), by calling
       the following:

       o ListTagsForResource  ,  which  gets  information about AWS tags for a
         specified Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in AWS CodeCommit.

       o TagResource , which adds or updates tags for a resource in AWS  Code-
         Commit.

       o UntagResource  , which removes tags for a resource in AWS CodeCommit.

       Triggers, by calling the following:

       o GetRepositoryTriggers , which returns information about triggers con-
         figured for a repository.

       o PutRepositoryTriggers  , which replaces all triggers for a repository
         and can be used to create or delete triggers.

       o TestRepositoryTriggers , which tests the functionality of  a  reposi-
         tory trigger by sending data to the trigger target.
