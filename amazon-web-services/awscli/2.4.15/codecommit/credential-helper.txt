EXAMPLES
       To  set up the credential helper included in the AWS CLI with AWS Code-
       Commit

       The credential-helper utility is not designed  to  be  called  directly
       from the AWS CLI. Instead it is intended to be used as a parameter with
       the git config command to set up your local computer. It enables Git to
       use  HTTPS and a cryptographically signed version of your IAM user cre-
       dentials or Amazon EC2 instance role whenever Git needs to authenticate
       with AWS to interact with CodeCommit repositories.

          git config --global credential.helper '!aws codecommit credential-helper $@'
          git config --global credential.UseHttpPath true

       Output:

          [credential]
              helper = !aws codecommit credential-helper $@
              UseHttpPath = true
