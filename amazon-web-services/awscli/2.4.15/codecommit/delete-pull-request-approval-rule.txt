DELETE-PULL-REQUEST-APPROVAL-RULE()        DELETE-PULL-REQUEST-APPROVAL-RULE()



NAME
       delete-pull-request-approval-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  an approval rule from a specified pull request. Approval rules
       can be deleted from a pull request only if the pull  request  is  open,
       and  if  the  approval rule was created specifically for a pull request
       and not generated from an approval rule template  associated  with  the
       repository  where  the  pull  request was created. You cannot delete an
       approval rule from a merged or closed pull request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-pull-request-approval-rule
          --pull-request-id <value>
          --approval-rule-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pull-request-id (string)
          The system-generated ID  of  the  pull  request  that  contains  the
          approval rule you want to delete.

       --approval-rule-name (string)
          The name of the approval rule you want to delete.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

              "approvalRuleId": "077d8e8a8-EXAMPLE"
          }

              response is 200 OK without content.
