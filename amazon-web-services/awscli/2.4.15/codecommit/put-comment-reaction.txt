DESCRIPTION
       Adds  or  updates  a reaction to a specified comment for the user whose

       reaction for yourself. You cannot add, modify, or delete a reaction for
       another user.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-comment-reaction
          --comment-id <value>
          --reaction-value <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --comment-id (string)
          The ID of the comment to which you want to add or update a reaction.

       --reaction-value (string)
          The  emoji reaction you want to add or update. To remove a reaction,
          provide a value of blank or null. You can also provide the value  of
          none.  For  information about emoji reaction values supported in AWS
          CodeCommit, see the AWS CodeCommit User Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
