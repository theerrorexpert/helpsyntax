NAME
       delete-file -

DESCRIPTION

       commits earlier to the commit that contains the deletion.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-file
          --repository-name <value>
          --branch-name <value>
          --file-path <value>
          --parent-commit-id <value>
          [--keep-empty-folders | --no-keep-empty-folders]
          [--commit-message <value>]
          [--name <value>]
          [--email <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository that contains the file to delete.

       --branch-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  branch where the commit that deletes the file is
          made.

       --file-path (string)
          The fully qualified path to the file that to be  deleted,  including
          the  full  name  and  extension  of  that  file. For example, /exam-
          ples/file.md is a fully qualified path to a file named file.md in  a
          folder named examples.

       --parent-commit-id (string)
          The ID of the commit that is the tip of the branch where you want to
          create the commit that deletes the file. This must be the HEAD  com-
          mit for the branch. The commit that deletes the file is created from
          this commit ID.

       --keep-empty-folders | --no-keep-empty-folders (boolean)
          If a file is the only object in the folder or  directory,  specifies
          whether to delete the folder or directory that contains the file. By
          default, empty folders are deleted. This includes empty folders that
          are  part  of the directory structure. For example, if the path to a
          file is dir1/dir2/dir3/dir4, and dir2 and dir3 are  empty,  deleting
          the last file in dir4 also deletes the empty folders dir4, dir3, and
          dir2.

       --commit-message (string)
          The commit message you want to include as part of deleting the file.
          Commit messages are limited to 256 KB. If no message is specified, a
          default message is used.

       --name (string)
          The name of the author of the commit that deletes the  file.  If  no
          name  is  specified,  the  user's ARN is used as the author name and
          committer name.

       --email (string)
          The email address for the commit that deletes the file. If no  email
          address is specified, the email address is left blank.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a file

       The  following  delete-file  example  demonstrates how to delete a file
       named README.md from a branch named main with a most recent  commit  ID
       of c5709475EXAMPLE in a repository named MyDemoRepo.

          aws codecommit delete-file \
              --repository-name MyDemoRepo \
              --branch-name main \
              --file-path README.md \
              --parent-commit-id c5709475EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "blobId":"559b44fEXAMPLE",
              "commitId":"353cf655EXAMPLE",
              "filePath":"README.md",
              "treeId":"6bc824cEXAMPLE"
          }

OUTPUT
       commitId -> (string)

          The blob ID removed from the tree as part of deleting the file.

       treeId -> (string)
          The  full  SHA-1 pointer of the tree information for the commit that
          contains the delete file change.

       filePath -> (string)
          The fully qualified path to the file to be  deleted,  including  the
          full name and extension of that file.
