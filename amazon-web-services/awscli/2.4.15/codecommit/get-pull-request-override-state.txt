GET-PULL-REQUEST-OVERRIDE-STATE()            GET-PULL-REQUEST-OVERRIDE-STATE()



NAME
       get-pull-request-override-state -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  whether approval rules have been set aside
       (overridden) for a pull request, and if so, the  Amazon  Resource  Name
       (ARN)  of  the  user  or  identity  that  overrode  the rules and their
       requirements for the pull request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-pull-request-override-state
          --pull-request-id <value>
          --revision-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pull-request-id (string)
          The ID of the pull request for which you  want  to  get  information
          about whether approval rules have been set aside (overridden).

       --revision-id (string)
          The  system-generated  ID  of  the revision for the pull request. To
          retrieve the most recent revision ID, use  GetPullRequest .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about the override status of a pull request

       The following get-pull-request-override-state example returns the over-
       ride  state  for  the  specified  pull  request.  In  this example, the
       approval rules for the pull request were overridden  by  a  user  named
       Mary Major, so the output returns a value of true.:

          aws codecommit get-pull-request-override-state \
              --pull-request-id 34  \
              --revision-id 9f29d167EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "overridden": true,
              "overrider": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Mary_Major"
          }

       For  more information, see Override Approval Rules on a Pull Request in
       the AWS CodeCommit User Guide.

OUTPUT
       overridden -> (boolean)
          A Boolean value that indicates whether a pull request  has  had  its
          rules  set  aside  (TRUE)  or whether all approval rules still apply
          (FALSE).

       overrider -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the user or identity that overrode
          the rules and their requirements for the pull request.
