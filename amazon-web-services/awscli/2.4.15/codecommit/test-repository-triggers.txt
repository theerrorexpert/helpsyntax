TEST-REPOSITORY-TRIGGERS()                          TEST-REPOSITORY-TRIGGERS()



NAME
       test-repository-triggers -

DESCRIPTION
       Tests  the  functionality of repository triggers by sending information
       to the trigger target. If real data is available in the repository, the
       test  sends  data from the last commit. If no data is available, sample
       data is generated.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            test-repository-triggers
          --repository-name <value>
          --triggers <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository in which to test the triggers.

       --triggers (list)
          The list of triggers to test.

          (structure)
              Information about a trigger for a repository.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the trigger.

              destinationArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the resource that is the target for a trigger (for
                 example, the ARN of a topic in Amazon SNS).

              customData -> (string)
                 Any custom data associated with the trigger to be included in
                 the information sent to the target of the trigger.

              branches -> (list)
                 The branches to be included in the trigger configuration.  If
                 you  specify  an  empty  array,  the  trigger  applies to all
                 branches.

                 NOTE:
                     Although no content is required in the  array,  you  must
                     include the array itself.

                 (string)

              events -> (list)
                 The  repository  events that cause the trigger to run actions
                 in another service, such as sending  a  notification  through
                 Amazon SNS.

                 NOTE:
                     The  valid value "all" cannot be used with any other val-
                     ues.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,destinationArn=string,customData=string,branches=string,string,events=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "destinationArn": "string",
              "customData": "string",
              "branches": ["string", ...],
              "events": ["all"|"updateReference"|"createReference"|"deleteReference", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To test triggers in a repository

       This example demonstrates how to test a trigger named  'MyFirstTrigger'
       in  an  AWS  CodeCommit  repository  named MyDemoRepo. In this example,
       events in the repository trigger notifications from  an  Amazon  Simple
       Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic.

       Command:

          aws codecommit test-repository-triggers --repository-name MyDemoRepo --triggers name=MyFirstTrigger,destinationArn=arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:111111111111:MyCodeCommitTopic,branches=mainline,preprod,events=all

       Output:

          {
            "successfulExecutions": [
                "MyFirstTrigger"
            ],
            "failedExecutions": []
          }

OUTPUT
       successfulExecutions -> (list)
          The  list  of triggers that were successfully tested. This list pro-
          vides the names of the triggers that were successfully tested, sepa-
          rated by commas.

          (string)

       failedExecutions -> (list)
          The  list  of  triggers that were not tested. This list provides the
          names of the triggers that could not be tested, separated by commas.

          (structure)
              A trigger failed to run.

              trigger -> (string)
                 The name of the trigger that did not run.

              failureMessage -> (string)
                 Message information about the trigger that did not run.
