SYNOPSIS
            create-pull-request
          --title <value>
          [--description <value>]
          --targets <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --title (string)
          The  title  of  the pull request. This title is used to identify the
          pull request to other users in the repository.

       --description (string)
          A description of the pull request.

       --targets (list)
          The targets for the pull request, including the source of  the  code
          to  be  reviewed  (the  source branch) and the destination where the
          creator of the pull request intends the code to be merged after  the
          pull request is closed (the destination branch).

          (structure)
              Returns information about a target for a pull request.

              repositoryName -> (string)
                 The name of the repository that contains the pull request.

              sourceReference -> (string)
                 The  branch  of  the repository that contains the changes for
                 the pull request. Also known as the source branch.

              destinationReference -> (string)
                 The branch of the repository where the pull  request  changes
                 are merged. Also known as the destination branch.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          repositoryName=string,sourceReference=string,destinationReference=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "repositoryName": "string",
              "sourceReference": "string",
              "destinationReference": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --client-request-token (string)
          A  unique, client-generated idempotency token that, when provided in
          a request, ensures the request cannot be  repeated  with  a  changed
          parameter.  If  a request is received with the same parameters and a
          token is included, the request returns information about the initial
          request that used that token.

          NOTE:
              The AWS SDKs prepopulate client request tokens. If you are using
              an AWS SDK, an idempotency token is created for you.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a pull request

       The following create-pull-request example creates a pull request  named
       'Pronunciation  difficulty  analyzer'  with  a  description  of 'Please
       review these changes by Tuesday' that targets the 'jane-branch'  source
       branch and is to be merged to the default branch 'main' in an AWS Code-
       Commit repository named 'MyDemoRepo'.

          aws codecommit create-pull-request \
              --title "My Pull Request" \
              --description "Please review these changes by Tuesday" \
              --client-request-token 123Example \
              --targets repositoryName=MyDemoRepo,sourceReference=MyNewBranch
