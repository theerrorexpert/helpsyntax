NAME
       batch-associate-approval-rule-template-with-repositories -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  association  between  an approval rule template and one or
       more specified repositories.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-associate-approval-rule-template-with-repositories
          --approval-rule-template-name <value>
          --repository-names <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --approval-rule-template-name (string)
          The name of the template you want to  associate  with  one  or  more
          repositories.

       --repository-names (list)
          The  names  of  the repositories you want to associate with the tem-
          plate.

          NOTE:
              The length constraint limit is for each string in the array. The
              array itself can be empty.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To  associate an approval rule template with multiple repositories in a
       single operation

       The following  batch-associate-approval-rule-template-with-repositories
       example associates the specified approval rule template with  reposito-
       ries named MyDemoRepo and MyOtherDemoRepo.

       Note: Approval rule templates are specific to the AWS Region where they
       are  created. They can only be associated with repositories in that AWS
       Region.

          aws codecommit batch-associate-approval-rule-template-with-repositories \
              --repository-names MyDemoRepo, MyOtherDemoRepo  \
              --approval-rule-template-name 2-approver-rule-for-main

       Output:

          {
              "associatedRepositoryNames": [
                  "MyDemoRepo",
                  "MyOtherDemoRepo"
              ],
              "errors": []
          }

       For more information, see Associate an Approval Rule  Template  with  a
       Repository in the AWS CodeCommit User Guide.

       errors -> (list)
          A list of any errors that might have occurred  while  attempting  to
          create the association between the template and the repositories.

          (structure)
              Returns  information  about  errors in a BatchAssociateApproval-
              RuleTemplateWithRepositories operation.

              repositoryName -> (string)
                 The name of the repository  where  the  association  was  not
                 made.

              errorCode -> (string)
                 An  error code that specifies whether the repository name was
                 not valid or not found.
