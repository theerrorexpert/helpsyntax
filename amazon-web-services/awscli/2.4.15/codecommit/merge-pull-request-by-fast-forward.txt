NAME
       merge-pull-request-by-fast-forward -

DESCRIPTION
       Attempts  to  merge the source commit of a pull request into the speci-
       fied destination branch for that pull request at the  specified  commit
       using  the  fast-forward merge strategy. If the merge is successful, it
       closes the pull request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            merge-pull-request-by-fast-forward
          --pull-request-id <value>
          --repository-name <value>
          [--source-commit-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pull-request-id (string)
          The system-generated ID of the pull request. To  get  this  ID,  use
          ListPullRequests .

       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository where the pull request was created.

       --source-commit-id (string)
          The  full  commit  ID  of the original or updated commit in the pull
          request source branch. Pass this value  if  you  want  an  exception
          thrown if the current commit ID of the tip of the source branch does
          not match this commit ID.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To merge and close a pull request

       This example demonstrates how to merge and close a  pull  request  with
       the ID of '47' and a source commit ID of '99132ab0EXAMPLE' in a reposi-
       tory named MyDemoRepo.

              --source-commit-id 99132ab0EXAMPLE \
              --repository-name MyDemoRepo
