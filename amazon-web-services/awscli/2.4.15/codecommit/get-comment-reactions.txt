       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-comment-reactions
          --comment-id <value>
          [--reaction-user-arn <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --comment-id (string)
          The  ID  of the comment for which you want to get reactions informa-
          tion.

       --reaction-user-arn (string)
          Optional. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the user or identity for
          which you want to get reaction information.

       --next-token (string)
          An  enumeration  token that, when provided in a request, returns the
          next batch of the results.

       --max-results (integer)
          A non-zero,  non-negative  integer  used  to  limit  the  number  of
          returned  results.  The  default is the same as the allowed maximum,
          1,000.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To view emoji reactions to a comment

       The following get-comment-reactions example lists all  emoji  reactions
       to  a  comment with the ID of abcd1234EXAMPLEb5678efgh. If the font for
       your shell supports displaying Emoji Version 1.0, then  in  the  output
       for emoji the emoji is displayed.
