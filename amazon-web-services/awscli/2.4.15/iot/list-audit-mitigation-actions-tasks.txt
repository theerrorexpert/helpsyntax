NAME
       list-audit-mitigation-actions-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a  list of audit mitigation action tasks that match the specified
       filters.

       Requires  permission  to  access  the   ListAuditMitigationActionsTasks
       action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-audit-mitigation-actions-tasks  is a paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: tasks

SYNOPSIS
            list-audit-mitigation-actions-tasks
          [--audit-task-id <value>]
          [--finding-id <value>]
          [--task-status <value>]
          --start-time <value>
          --end-time <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --audit-task-id (string)
          Specify this filter to limit results to tasks that were  applied  to
          results for a specific audit.

       --finding-id (string)
          Specify this filter to limit results to tasks that were applied to a
          specific audit finding.

       --task-status (string)
          Specify this filter to limit results to tasks that are in a specific
          state.

          Possible values:

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o COMPLETED

          o FAILED

          o CANCELED

       --start-time (timestamp)
          Specify this filter to limit results to tasks that began on or after
          a specific date and time.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          Specify this filter to limit results to tasks that were completed or
          canceled on or before a specific date and time.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list audit mitigation action tasks

       The following  list-audit-mitigation-actions-tasks  example  lists  the
       mitigation  actions  that were applied to findings within the specified
       time period.

          aws iot list-audit-mitigation-actions-tasks \
              --start-time 1594157400 \
              --end-time 1594157430

       Output:

          {
              "tasks": [
                  {
                          "taskId": "0062f2d6-3999-488f-88c7-bef005414103",
                          "startTime": "2020-07-07T14:30:15.172000-07:00",
                      "taskStatus": "COMPLETED"
                  }
              ]
          }
