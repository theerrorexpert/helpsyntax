LIST-ATTACHED-POLICIES()                              LIST-ATTACHED-POLICIES()



NAME
       list-attached-policies -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the policies attached to the specified thing group.

       Requires permission to access the ListAttachedPolicies action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-attached-policies is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: policies

SYNOPSIS
            list-attached-policies
          --target <value>
          [--recursive | --no-recursive]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --target (string)
          The group or principal for which the policies will be listed.  Valid
          principals   are   CertificateArn   (arn:aws:iot:region   :accountId
          :cert/certificateId ), thingGroupArn (arn:aws:iot:region  :accountId
          :thinggroup/groupName ) and CognitoId (region :id ).

       --recursive | --no-recursive (boolean)
          When true, recursively list attached policies.

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To list the policies attached to a group

       The following list-attached-policies example lists  the  policies  that
       are attached to the specified group.

          aws iot list-attached-policies \
              --target "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:thinggroup/LightBulbs"

       Output:

          {
              "policies": [
                  {
                      "policyName": "UpdateDeviceCertPolicy",
                      "policyArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:policy/UpdateDeviceCertPolicy"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Example 2: To list the policies attached to a device certificate

       The following list-attached-policies example lists the AWS IoT policies
       attached  to  the  device certificate. The certificate is identified by
       its ARN.

          aws iot list-attached-policies \
              --target arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:cert/488b6a7f2acdeb00a77384e63c4e40b18b1b3caaae57b7272ba44c45e3448142

       Output:

          {
              "policies": [
                  {
                      "policyName": "TemperatureSensorPolicy",
                      "policyArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:policy/TemperatureSensorPolicy"
                  }
              ]
          }
