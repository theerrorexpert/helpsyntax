GET-STATISTICS()                                              GET-STATISTICS()



NAME
       get-statistics -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  count,  average,  sum,  minimum, maximum, sum of squares,
       variance, and standard deviation for the specified aggregated field. If
       the  aggregation  field is of type String , only the count statistic is
       returned.

       Requires permission to access the GetStatistics action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-statistics
          [--index-name <value>]
          --query-string <value>
          [--aggregation-field <value>]
          [--query-version <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --index-name (string)
          The name of the index to search. The default value is AWS_Things .

       --query-string (string)
          The query used to search. You can specify "*" for the  query  string
          to  get  the count of all indexed things in your Amazon Web Services
          account.

       --aggregation-field (string)
          The aggregation field name.

       --query-version (string)
          The version of the query used to search.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To search the device index for aggregate data

       The following get-statistics example returns the number of things  that
       have  a  property  called connectivity.connected set to false (that is,
       the number of devices that are not connected) in their device shadow.

          aws iot get-statistics \
              --index-name AWS_Things \
              --query-string "connectivity.connected:false"

       Output:

          {
              "statistics": {
                  "count": 6
              }
          }

       the AWS IoT Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       statistics -> (structure)
          The  statistics  returned by the Fleet Indexing service based on the
          query and aggregation field.

          count -> (integer)
              The count of things that match the  query  string  criteria  and
              contain a valid aggregation field value.

          average -> (double)
              The average of the aggregated field values.

          sum -> (double)
              The sum of the aggregated field values.

          minimum -> (double)
              The minimum aggregated field value.

          maximum -> (double)
              The maximum aggregated field value.

          sumOfSquares -> (double)
              The sum of the squares of the aggregated field values.

          variance -> (double)
              The variance of the aggregated field values.

          stdDeviation -> (double)
              The standard deviation of the aggregated field values.
