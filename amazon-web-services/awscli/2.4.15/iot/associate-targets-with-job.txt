       o The job status must currently be "IN_PROGRESS".

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            associate-targets-with-job
          --targets <value>
          --job-id <value>
          [--comment <value>]
          [--namespace-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --targets (list)
          A list of thing group ARNs that define the targets of the job.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --job-id (string)
          The unique identifier you assigned to this job when it was  created.

       --comment (string)
          An  optional  comment  string  describing why the job was associated
          with the targets.

       --namespace-id (string)
          The namespace used to indicate that a job is a customer-managed job.

          When you specify a value for this parameter, Amazon Web Services IoT
          Core sends jobs notifications to MQTT topics that contain the  value
          in the following format.
              $aws/things/*THING_NAME*      /jobs/*JOB_ID*      /notify-names-
              pace-*NAMESPACE_ID* /

          NOTE:
              The namespaceId feature is in public preview.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       To associate a thing group with a continuous job

       The following associate-targets-with-job example associates the  speci-
       fied thing group with the specified continuous job.

          aws iot associate-targets-with-job \
              --targets "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:thinggroup/LightBulbs" \
              --job-id "example-job-04"

       Output:

          {
              "jobArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:job/example-job-04",
              "jobId": "example-job-04",
              "description": "example continuous job"
          }

       IoT Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       jobArn -> (string)
          An ARN identifying the job.

       jobId -> (string)
          The unique identifier you assigned to this job when it was  created.

       description -> (string)
