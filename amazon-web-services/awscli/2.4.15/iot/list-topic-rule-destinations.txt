LIST-TOPIC-RULE-DESTINATIONS()                  LIST-TOPIC-RULE-DESTINATIONS()



NAME
       list-topic-rule-destinations -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  the  topic  rule  destinations  in your Amazon Web Services
       account.

       Requires permission to access the ListTopicRuleDestinations action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-topic-rule-destinations is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: destinationSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-topic-rule-destinations
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list your topic rule destinations

       The following list-topic-rule-destinations example lists all topic rule
       destinations that you have defined in the current AWS Region.

          aws iot list-topic-rule-destinations

       Output:

          {
              "destinationSummaries": [
                  {
                      "arn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:ruledestination/http/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-11111EXAMPLE",
                      "status": "ENABLED",
                      "httpUrlSummary": {
                          "confirmationUrl": "https://example.com"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       destinationSummaries -> (list)
          Information about a topic rule destination.

          (structure)
              Information about the topic rule destination.

              arn -> (string)
                 The topic rule destination ARN.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the topic rule destination. Valid values are:
                     IN_PROGRESS

                 A topic rule destination was created but has  not  been  con-
                 firmed.  You can set status to IN_PROGRESS by calling Update-
                 TopicRuleDestination  .  Calling   UpdateTopicRuleDestination
                 causes  a  new confirmation challenge to be sent to your con-
                 firmation endpoint.
                     ENABLED

                 Confirmation was completed, and traffic to  this  destination
                 is allowed. You can set status to DISABLED by calling Update-
                 TopicRuleDestination .
                     DISABLED

                 Confirmation was completed, and traffic to  this  destination
                 is  not  allowed.  You  can  set status to ENABLED by calling
                 UpdateTopicRuleDestination .
                     ERROR

                 Confirmation could not be completed, for example if the  con-
                 firmation timed out. You can call GetTopicRuleDestination for
                 details about the error. You can set status to IN_PROGRESS by
                 calling   UpdateTopicRuleDestination  .  Calling  UpdateTopi-
                 cRuleDestination causes a new confirmation  challenge  to  be
                 sent to your confirmation endpoint.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time when the topic rule destination was cre-
                 ated.

              lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the topic rule  destination  was  last
                 updated.

              statusReason -> (string)
                 The  reason the topic rule destination is in the current sta-
                 tus.

              httpUrlSummary -> (structure)
                 Information about the HTTP URL.

                     The URL used to confirm ownership of  or  access  to  the
                     HTTP topic rule destination URL.

              vpcDestinationSummary -> (structure)
                 Information about the virtual private cloud (VPC) connection.

                 subnetIds -> (list)
                     The subnet IDs of the VPC destination.

                     (string)

                 securityGroups -> (list)
