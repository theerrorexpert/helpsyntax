LIST-CERTIFICATES-BY-CA()                            LIST-CERTIFICATES-BY-CA()



NAME
       list-certificates-by-ca -

DESCRIPTION
       List the device certificates signed by the specified CA certificate.

       Requires permission to access the ListCertificatesByCA action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-certificates-by-ca  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: certificates

SYNOPSIS
            list-certificates-by-ca
          --ca-certificate-id <value>
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--ascending-order | --no-ascending-order]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --ca-certificate-id (string)
          The ID of the CA certificate. This operation will  list  all  regis-
          tered device certificate that were signed by this CA certificate.

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --ascending-order | --no-ascending-order (boolean)
          Specifies the order for results. If True, the results  are  returned
          in ascending order, based on the creation date.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list all device certificates signed with a CA certificate

       The following list-certificates-by-ca example lists all device certifi-
       cates in your AWS account that are signed with the  specified  CA  cer-
       tificate.

          aws iot list-certificates-by-ca \
              --ca-certificate-id f4efed62c0142f16af278166f61962501165c4f0536295207426460058cd1467

       Output:

          {
              "certificates": [
                  {
                      "certificateArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:cert/488b6a7f2acdeb00a77384e63c4e40b18b1b3caaae57b7272ba44c45e3448142",
                      "certificateId": "488b6a7f2acdeb00a77384e63c4e40b18b1b3caaae57b7272ba44c45e3448142",
                      "status": "ACTIVE",
                      "creationDate": 1569363250.557
                  }
              ]
          }
