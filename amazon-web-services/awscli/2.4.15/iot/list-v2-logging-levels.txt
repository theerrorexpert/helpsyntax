LIST-V2-LOGGING-LEVELS()                              LIST-V2-LOGGING-LEVELS()



NAME
       list-v2-logging-levels -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists logging levels.

       Requires permission to access the ListV2LoggingLevels action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-v2-logging-levels is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: logTargetConfigurations

SYNOPSIS
            list-v2-logging-levels
          [--target-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --target-type (string)
          The type of resource for which you are configuring logging. Must  be
          THING_Group .

          Possible values:

          o DEFAULT

          o THING_GROUP

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list logging levels

       The following list-v2-logging-levels example lists the configured  log-
       ging  levels.  If logging levels were not set, a NotConfiguredException
       occurs when you run this command.

          aws iot list-v2-logging-levels

       Output:

          {
              "logTargetConfigurations": [
                  {
                      "logTarget": {
                          "targetType": "DEFAULT"
                      },
                      "logLevel": "ERROR"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       logTargetConfigurations -> (list)
          The logging configuration for a target.

          (structure)
              The target configuration.

              logTarget -> (structure)
                 A log target

                 targetType -> (string)
                     The target type.

                 targetName -> (string)
                     The target name.

              logLevel -> (string)
                 The logging level.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to get the next set of results, or  null  if  there
          are no additional results.
