DESCRIBE-THING()                                              DESCRIBE-THING()



NAME
       describe-thing -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about the specified thing.

       Requires permission to access the DescribeThing action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-thing
          --thing-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --thing-name (string)
          The name of the thing.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To display detailed information about a thing

       The  following describe-thing example display information about a thing
       (device) that is defined in the AWS IoT registry for your AWS  account.

          aws iot describe-thing
                 --thing-name "MyLightBulb"

       Output:

          {
              "defaultClientId": "MyLightBulb",
              "thingName": "MyLightBulb",
              "thingId": "40da2e73-c6af-406e-b415-15acae538797",
              "thingArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:thing/MyLightBulb",
              "thingTypeName": "LightBulb",
              "attributes": {
                  "model": "123",
                  "wattage": "75"
              },
              "version": 1
          }

       AWS IoT Developers Guide.

OUTPUT
       defaultClientId -> (string)
          The default MQTT client ID. For a typical device, the thing name  is
          also  used as the default MQTT client ID. Although we dont require a
          mapping between a thing's registry name and its use of  MQTT  client
          IDs,  certificates,  or shadow state, we recommend that you choose a
          thing name and use it as the MQTT client ID for the registry and the
          Device Shadow service.

          This  lets  you  better organize your IoT fleet without removing the
          flexibility of the underlying device certificate model or shadows.

       thingName -> (string)
          The name of the thing.

       thingId -> (string)
          The ID of the thing to describe.

       thingArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the thing to describe.

       thingTypeName -> (string)
          The thing type name.

       attributes -> (map)
          The thing attributes.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       version -> (long)
          The current version of the thing record in the registry.

          NOTE:
              To avoid unintentional changes to the information  in  the  reg-
              istry,  you can pass the version information in the expectedVer-
              sion parameter of the UpdateThing and DeleteThing calls.

       billingGroupName -> (string)
          The name of the billing group the thing belongs to.
