DESCRIBE-AUDIT-TASK()                                    DESCRIBE-AUDIT-TASK()



NAME
       describe-audit-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about a Device Defender audit.

       Requires permission to access the DescribeAuditTask action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-audit-task
          --task-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --task-id (string)
          The ID of the audit whose information you want to get.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about an audit instance

       The  following  describe-audit-task  example  gets information about an
       instance of an AWS IoT Device Defender audit. If the audit is complete,
       summary statistics for the run are included in the results.

          aws iot describe-audit-task \
              --task-id a3aea009955e501a31b764abe1bebd3d
