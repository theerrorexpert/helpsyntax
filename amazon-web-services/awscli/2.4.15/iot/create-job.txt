OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          A  job  identifier which must be unique for your Amazon Web Services
          account. We recommend using a UUID.  Alpha-numeric  characters,  "-"
          and "_" are valid for use here.

       --targets (list)
          A list of things and thing groups to which the job should be sent.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --document-source (string)
          An  S3  link  to  the  job document. Required if you don't specify a
          value for document .

          NOTE:
              If the job document resides in an S3  bucket,  you  must  use  a
              placeholder link when specifying the document.

              The placeholder link is of the following form:
                 ${aws:iot:s3-presigned-url:https://s3.amazonaws.com/*bucket*
                 /*key* }

              where bucket is your bucket name and key is the  object  in  the
              bucket to which you are linking.

       --document (string)
          The  job  document.  Required if you don't specify a value for docu-
          mentSource .

       --description (string)
          A short text description of the job.

       --presigned-url-config (structure)
          Configuration information for pre-signed S3 URLs.

          roleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of an IAM role that grants grants permission to download
              files  from the S3 bucket where the job data/updates are stored.
              The role must also grant permission  for  IoT  to  download  the
              files.

          expiresInSec -> (long)
              How  long  (in  seconds) pre-signed URLs are valid. Valid values
              are 60 - 3600, the default value  is  3600  seconds.  Pre-signed
              URLs  are  generated  when Jobs receives an MQTT request for the
              job document.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          roleArn=string,expiresInSec=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "roleArn": "string",
            "expiresInSec": long
          }

       --target-selection (string)
          Specifies whether the job will continue to run (CONTINUOUS), or will
          be  complete  after  all those things specified as targets have com-
          pleted the job (SNAPSHOT). If continuous, the job may also be run on
          a  thing  when  a change is detected in a target. For example, a job
          will run on a thing when the thing is added to a target group,  even
          after the job was completed by all things originally in the group.

          Possible values:

          o CONTINUOUS

          o SNAPSHOT

       --job-executions-rollout-config (structure)
          Allows you to create a staged rollout of the job.

          maximumPerMinute -> (integer)
              The  maximum number of things that will be notified of a pending
              job, per minute. This parameter allows you to  create  a  staged
              rollout.

          exponentialRate -> (structure)
              The  rate  of  increase for a job rollout. This parameter allows
              you to define an exponential rate for a job rollout.

              baseRatePerMinute -> (integer)
                 The minimum number of things that will be notified of a pend-
                 ing job, per minute at the start of job rollout. This parame-
                 ter allows you to define the initial rate of rollout.

              incrementFactor -> (double)
                 The exponential factor to increase the rate of rollout for  a
                 job.

                 Amazon  Web  Services IoT Core supports up to one digit after
                 the decimal (for example, 1.5, but not 1.55).

              rateIncreaseCriteria -> (structure)
                 The criteria to initiate the increase in rate of rollout  for
                 a job.

                 numberOfNotifiedThings -> (integer)
                     The  threshold  for  number  of notified things that will
                     initiate the increase in rate of rollout.

                 numberOfSucceededThings -> (integer)
                     The threshold for number of succeeded  things  that  will
                     initiate the increase in rate of rollout.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          maximumPerMinute=integer,exponentialRate={baseRatePerMinute=integer,incrementFactor=double,rateIncreaseCriteria={numberOfNotifiedThings=integer,numberOfSucceededThings=integer}}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "maximumPerMinute": integer,
            "exponentialRate": {
              "baseRatePerMinute": integer,

          criteriaList -> (list)
              The  list  of  criteria that determine when and how to abort the
              job.

              (structure)
                 The criteria that determine when and how a  job  abort  takes
                 place.

                 failureType -> (string)
                     The  type  of  job execution failures that can initiate a
                     job abort.

                 action -> (string)
                     The type of job action to take to initiate the job abort.

                 thresholdPercentage -> (double)
                     The  minimum  percentage  of  job execution failures that
                     must occur to initiate the job abort.

                     Amazon Web Services IoT Core supports up  to  two  digits
                     after  the  decimal (for example, 10.9 and 10.99, but not
                     10.999).

                 minNumberOfExecutedThings -> (integer)
                     The minimum number of things which must receive job  exe-
                     cution notifications before the job can be aborted.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          criteriaList=[{failureType=string,action=string,thresholdPercentage=double,minNumberOfExecutedThings=integer},{failureType=string,action=string,thresholdPercentage=double,minNumberOfExecutedThings=integer}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "criteriaList": [
              {
                "failureType": "FAILED"|"REJECTED"|"TIMED_OUT"|"ALL",
                "action": "CANCEL",
                "thresholdPercentage": double,
                "minNumberOfExecutedThings": integer
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --timeout-config (structure)
          Specifies the amount of time each device has to finish its execution
          of the job. The timer is started when the job  execution  status  is
          set  to  IN_PROGRESS  .  If  the  job execution status is not set to
          another terminal state before the time expires, it will be automati-
          cally set to TIMED_OUT .

          inProgressTimeoutInMinutes -> (long)
              Specifies  the  amount  of  time, in minutes, this device has to
              finish execution of this job. The timeout interval can  be  any-
              where  between  1 minute and 7 days (1 to 10080 minutes). The in
              progress timer can't be updated and will apply to all job execu-
              tions  for  the  job.  Whenever  a  job execution remains in the
              IN_PROGRESS status for longer than this interval, the job execu-
              tion will fail and switch to the terminal TIMED_OUT status.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          inProgressTimeoutInMinutes=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "inProgressTimeoutInMinutes": long
          }

       --tags (list)
          Metadata which can be used to manage the job.

          (structure)
              A set of key/value pairs that are used to manage the resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag's key.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag's value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --namespace-id (string)
          The namespace used to indicate that a job is a customer-managed job.

          When you specify a value for this parameter, Amazon Web Services IoT
          Core  sends jobs notifications to MQTT topics that contain the value
          in the following format.
              $aws/things/*THING_NAME*      /jobs/*JOB_ID*      /notify-names-
              pace-*NAMESPACE_ID* /

          NOTE:
              The namespaceId feature is in public preview.

       --job-template-arn (string)
          The ARN of the job template used to create the job.

       --job-executions-retry-config (structure)

          criteriaList -> (list)
              The  list  of  criteria  that  determines  how  many retries are
              allowed for each failure type for a job.

              (structure)
                 The criteria that determines how many retries are allowed for
                 each failure type for a job.

                 failureType -> (string)
                     The  type  of  job execution failures that can initiate a
                     job retry.

                 numberOfRetries -> (integer)
                     The number of retries allowed for a failure type for  the
                     job.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          criteriaList=[{failureType=string,numberOfRetries=integer},{failureType=string,numberOfRetries=integer}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "criteriaList": [
              {
                "failureType": "FAILED"|"TIMED_OUT"|"ALL",

            ]
          }

       --document-parameters (map)
          Parameters  of a managed template that you can specify to create the
          job document.

          key -> (string)

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To create a job

       The following create-job example creates a  simple  AWS  IoT  job  that
       sends a JSON document to the MyRaspberryPi device.

          aws iot create-job \
              --job-id "example-job-01" \
              --targets "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:thing/MyRaspberryPi" \
              --document file://example-job.json \
              --description "example job test" \
              --target-selection SNAPSHOT

       Output:

          {
              "jobArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:job/example-job-01",
              "jobId": "example-job-01",
              "description": "example job test"
          }

       Example 2: To create a continuous job

       The  following  create-job  example creates a job that continues to run
       after the things specified as targets have completed the job.  In  this
       example,  the target is a thing group, so when new devices are added to
       the group, the continuous job runs on those new things.

          aws iot create-job
                 --job-id              "example-job-04"              --targets
                 "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:thinggroup/DeadBulbs"
                 --document  file://example-job.json  --description   "example
                 continuous job" --target-selection CONTINUOUS

       Output:

          {
              "jobArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:job/example-job-04",
              "jobId": "example-job-04",
              "description": "example continuous job"
          }

       IoT Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       jobArn -> (string)
          The job ARN.

       jobId -> (string)
          The unique identifier you assigned to this job.

       description -> (string)
          The job description.
