LIST-AUDIT-TASKS()                                          LIST-AUDIT-TASKS()



NAME
       list-audit-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  Device  Defender  audits  that have been performed during a
       given time period.

       Requires permission to access the ListAuditTasks action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-audit-tasks is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: tasks

SYNOPSIS
            list-audit-tasks
          --start-time <value>
          --end-time <value>
          [--task-type <value>]
          [--task-status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --start-time (timestamp)
          The  beginning of the time period. Audit information is retained for
          a limited time (90 days). Requesting a start time prior to  what  is
          retained results in an "InvalidRequestException".

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end of the time period.

       --task-type (string)
          A  filter to limit the output to the specified type of audit: can be
          one of "ON_DEMAND_AUDIT_TASK" or "SCHEDULED__AUDIT_TASK".

          Possible values:

          o ON_DEMAND_AUDIT_TASK

          o SCHEDULED_AUDIT_TASK

       --task-status (string)
          A filter to limit the output to audits with the specified completion
          status: can be one of "IN_PROGRESS", "COMPLETED", "FAILED", or "CAN-
          CELED".

          Possible values:

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o COMPLETED

          o FAILED

          o CANCELED

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list all findings from an audit

       The  following  list-audit-tasks example lists the audit tasks that ran
       between June 5, 2019 and June 12, 2019.

              --start-time 1559747125 \
              --end-time 1560357228

       Output:
