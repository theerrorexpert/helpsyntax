LIST-ACTIVE-VIOLATIONS()                              LIST-ACTIVE-VIOLATIONS()



NAME
       list-active-violations -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  active violations for a given Device Defender security pro-
       file.

       Requires permission to access the ListActiveViolations action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-active-violations is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: activeViolations

SYNOPSIS
            list-active-violations
          [--thing-name <value>]
          [--security-profile-name <value>]
          [--behavior-criteria-type <value>]
          [--list-suppressed-alerts | --no-list-suppressed-alerts]
          [--verification-state <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --thing-name (string)
          The name of the thing whose active violations are listed.

       --security-profile-name (string)
          The  name  of  the Device Defender security profile for which viola-
          tions are listed.

       --behavior-criteria-type (string)
          The criteria for a behavior.

          Possible values:

          o STATIC

          o STATISTICAL

          o MACHINE_LEARNING

       --list-suppressed-alerts | --no-list-suppressed-alerts (boolean)
          A list of all suppressed alerts.

       --verification-state (string)
          The verification state of the violation (detect alarm).

          Possible values:

          o FALSE_POSITIVE

          o BENIGN_POSITIVE

          o TRUE_POSITIVE

          o UNKNOWN

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       activeViolations -> (list)
          The list of active violations.

          (structure)
              Information about an active  Device  Defender  security  profile
              behavior violation.

              violationId -> (string)
                 The ID of the active violation.

              thingName -> (string)
                 The name of the thing responsible for the active violation.

              securityProfileName -> (string)
                 The security profile with the behavior is in violation.

              behavior -> (structure)
                 The behavior that is being violated.

                 name -> (string)
                     The name you've given to the behavior.

                 metric -> (string)
                     What is measured by the behavior.

                 metricDimension -> (structure)
                     The dimension for a metric in your behavior. For example,
                     using a TOPIC_FILTER dimension, you can narrow  down  the
                     scope  of  the  metric to only MQTT topics where the name
                     matches the pattern  specified  in  the  dimension.  This
                     can't be used with custom metrics.

                     dimensionName -> (string)
                        A unique identifier for the dimension.

                     operator -> (string)
                        Defines  how  the  dimensionValues  of a dimension are
                        interpreted.   For   example,   for   dimension   type
                        TOPIC_FILTER,  the  IN  operator,  a  message  will be
                        counted only if its topic matches  one  of  the  topic
                        filters.  With  NOT_IN  operator,  a  message  will be
                        counted only if it doesn't match any of the topic fil-
                        ters.  The  operator is optional: if it's not provided
                        (is null ), it will be interpreted as IN .

                 criteria -> (structure)
                     The criteria that determine if a device is behaving  nor-
                     mally in regard to the metric .

                     comparisonOperator -> (string)
                        The operator that relates the thing measured (metric )
                        to the  criteria  (containing  a  value  or  statisti-
                        calThreshold ). Valid operators include:

                        o string-list : in-set and not-in-set

                        o number-list : in-set and not-in-set

                        o ip-address-list : in-cidr-set and not-in-cidr-set

                        o number : less-than , less-than-equals , greater-than
                          , and greater-than-equals

                     value -> (structure)
                        The value to be compared with the metric .

                        count -> (long)
                            If the  comparisonOperator  calls  for  a  numeric
                            value,  use  this to specify that numeric value to
                            be compared with the metric .

                        cidrs -> (list)
                            If the  comparisonOperator  calls  for  a  set  of
                            CIDRs, use this to specify that set to be compared
                            with the metric .

                            (string)

                        ports -> (list)
                            If the  comparisonOperator  calls  for  a  set  of
                            ports, use this to specify that set to be compared
                            with the metric .

                            (integer)

                        number -> (double)
                            The numeral value of a metric.

                        numbers -> (list)
                            The numeral values of a metric.

                            (double)

                        strings -> (list)
                            The string values of a metric.

                            (string)

                     durationSeconds -> (integer)
                        Use this to specify the time duration over  which  the
                        behavior  is evaluated, for those criteria that have a
                        time dimension (for example, NUM_MESSAGES_SENT ).  For
                        a  statisticalThreshhold  metric  comparison, measure-
                        ments from all devices are accumulated over this  time
                        duration  before  being used to calculate percentiles,
                        and later, measurements from an individual device  are
                        also  accumulated over this time duration before being
                        given  a  percentile  rank.  Cannot   be   used   with
                        list-based metric datatypes.

                     consecutiveDatapointsToAlarm -> (integer)
                        If  a  device  is in violation of the behavior for the
                        specified number of consecutive datapoints,  an  alarm
                        occurs. If not specified, the default is 1.

                     consecutiveDatapointsToClear -> (integer)
                        If  an  alarm has occurred and the offending device is
                        no longer in violation of the behavior for the  speci-
                        fied  number  of  consecutive datapoints, the alarm is
                        cleared. If not specified, the default is 1.

                     statisticalThreshold -> (structure)
                        A statistical  ranking  (percentile)that  indicates  a
                        threshold  value  by which a behavior is determined to
                        be in compliance or in violation of the behavior.

                        statistic -> (string)
                            The percentile that resolves to a threshold  value
                            by which compliance with a behavior is determined.
                            Metrics are collected over  the  specified  period
                            (durationSeconds  )  from all reporting devices in
                            your account and statistical ranks are calculated.
                            Then, the measurements from a device are collected
                            over the same period. If the accumulated  measure-
                            ments from the device fall above or below (compar-
                            isonOperator ) the value associated with the  per-
                            centile  specified,  then the device is considered
                            to be in compliance with the behavior, otherwise a
                            violation occurs.

                     the metric .

                 cidrs -> (list)
                     If  the  comparisonOperator calls for a set of CIDRs, use
                     this to specify that set to be compared with the metric .

                     (string)

                 ports -> (list)
                     If  the  comparisonOperator calls for a set of ports, use
                     this to specify that set to be compared with the metric .

                     (integer)

                 number -> (double)
                     The numeral value of a metric.
