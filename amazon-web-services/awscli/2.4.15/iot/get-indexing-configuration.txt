GET-INDEXING-CONFIGURATION()                      GET-INDEXING-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       get-indexing-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the indexing configuration.

       Requires permission to access the GetIndexingConfiguration action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-indexing-configuration
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the thing indexing configuration

       The  following get-indexing-configuration example gets the current con-
       figuration data for AWS IoT fleet indexing.

          aws iot get-indexing-configuration

       Output:

          {
              "thingIndexingConfiguration": {
                  "thingIndexingMode": "OFF",
                  "thingConnectivityIndexingMode": "OFF"
              },
              "thingGroupIndexingConfiguration": {
                  "thingGroupIndexingMode": "OFF"
              }
          }

       opers Guide.

OUTPUT
       thingIndexingConfiguration -> (structure)
          Thing indexing configuration.

          thingIndexingMode -> (string)
              Thing indexing mode. Valid values are:

              o REGISTRY  Your thing index contains registry data only.

              o REGISTRY_AND_SHADOW  -  Your thing index contains registry and
                shadow data.

              o OFF - Thing indexing is disabled.

          thingConnectivityIndexingMode -> (string)
              Thing connectivity indexing mode. Valid values are:

              o STATUS  Your thing  index  contains  connectivity  status.  To
                enable thing connectivity indexing, thingIndexMode must not be
                set to OFF.

              o OFF - Thing connectivity status indexing is disabled.

          deviceDefenderIndexingMode -> (string)
              Device Defender indexing mode. Valid values are:

              o VIOLATIONS  Your thing index contains Device  Defender  viola-
                tions.  To  enable  Device  Defender  indexing,  deviceDefend-
                erIndexingMode must not be set to OFF.

              o OFF - Device Defender indexing is disabled.

              For more  information  about  Device  Defender  violations,  see
              Device Defender Detect.

          namedShadowIndexingMode -> (string)
              Named shadow indexing mode. Valid values are:

              o ON   Your  thing  index contains named shadow. To enable thing
                named shadow indexing, namedShadowIndexingMode must not be set
                to OFF.

              o OFF - Named shadow indexing is disabled.

              For  more  information about Shadows, see IoT Device Shadow ser-
              vice.
