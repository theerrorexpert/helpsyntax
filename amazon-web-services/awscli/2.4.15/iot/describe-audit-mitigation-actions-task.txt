NAME
       describe-audit-mitigation-actions-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  information  about an audit mitigation task that is used to apply
       mitigation actions to a set of audit findings. Properties  include  the
       actions being applied, the audit checks to which they're being applied,
       the task status, and aggregated task statistics.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-audit-mitigation-actions-task
          --task-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --task-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the audit mitigation task.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To show the details of an audit mitigation actions task

       The following describe-audit-mitigation-actions-task example shows  the
       details  for the specified task, where the ResetPolicyVersionAction was
       applied to a finding. The results include when  the  task  started  and
       ended, how many findings were targeted (and the outcome), and the defi-
       nition of the action that is applied as part of this task.
