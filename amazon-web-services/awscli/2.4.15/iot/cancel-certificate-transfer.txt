CANCEL-CERTIFICATE-TRANSFER()                    CANCEL-CERTIFICATE-TRANSFER()



NAME
       cancel-certificate-transfer -

DESCRIPTION
       Cancels a pending transfer for the specified certificate.
          Note Only the transfer source account can use this operation to can-
          cel a transfer. (Transfer destinations can  use   RejectCertificate-
          Transfer  instead.)  After  transfer, IoT returns the certificate to
          the source account in the  INACTIVE  state.  After  the  destination
          account has accepted the transfer, the transfer cannot be cancelled.

       After a certificate transfer is cancelled, the status of  the  certifi-
       cate changes from PENDING_TRANSFER to INACTIVE.

       Requires permission to access the CancelCertificateTransfer action.

SYNOPSIS
            cancel-certificate-transfer
          --certificate-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the  certificate. (The last part of the certificate ARN
          contains the certificate ID.)

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To cancel the transfer a certificate to a different AWS account

       The following cancel-certificate-transfer example cancels the  transfer
       of the specified certificate transfer. The certificate is identified by
       a certificate ID. You can find the ID for a certificate in the AWS  IoT
       console.

          aws iot cancel-certificate-transfer \
              --certificate-id f0f33678c7c9a046e5cc87b2b1a58dfa0beec26db78addd5e605d630e05c7fc8

       This command produces no output.

       the AWS IoT Core Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
