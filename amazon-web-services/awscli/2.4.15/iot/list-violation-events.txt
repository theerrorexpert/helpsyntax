LIST-VIOLATION-EVENTS()                                LIST-VIOLATION-EVENTS()



NAME
       list-violation-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the Device Defender security profile violations discovered during
       the given time period. You can use filters  to  limit  the  results  to
       those  alerts  issued  for  a particular security profile, behavior, or
       thing (device).

       Requires permission to access the ListViolationEvents action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-violation-events is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: violationEvents

OPTIONS
       --start-time (timestamp)
          The start time for the alerts to be listed.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end time for the alerts to be listed.

       --thing-name (string)
          A  filter  to  limit results to those alerts caused by the specified
          thing.

       --security-profile-name (string)
          A filter to limit results to those alerts generated by the specified
          security profile.

       --behavior-criteria-type (string)
          The criteria for a behavior.

          Possible values:

          o STATIC

          o STATISTICAL

          o MACHINE_LEARNING

       --list-suppressed-alerts | --no-list-suppressed-alerts (boolean)
          A list of all suppressed alerts.

       --verification-state (string)
          The verification state of the violation (detect alarm).

          Possible values:

          o FALSE_POSITIVE

          o BENIGN_POSITIVE

          o TRUE_POSITIVE

          o UNKNOWN

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       violationEvents -> (list)
          The security profile violation alerts issued for this account during
          the  given  time  period,  potentially filtered by security profile,
          behavior violated, or thing (device) violating.

          (structure)
              Information about a Device Defender  security  profile  behavior
              violation.

              violationId -> (string)
                 The ID of the violation event.

              thingName -> (string)
                 The name of the thing responsible for the violation event.

              securityProfileName -> (string)
                 The name of the security profile whose behavior was violated.

              behavior -> (structure)
                 The behavior that was violated.

                 name -> (string)
                     The name you've given to the behavior.

                 metric -> (string)
                     What is measured by the behavior.

                 metricDimension -> (structure)
                     The dimension for a metric in your behavior. For example,
                     using  a  TOPIC_FILTER dimension, you can narrow down the
                     scope of the metric to only MQTT topics  where  the  name
                     matches  the  pattern  specified  in  the dimension. This
                     can't be used with custom metrics.

                     dimensionName -> (string)
                        A unique identifier for the dimension.

                     operator -> (string)
                        Defines how the dimensionValues  of  a  dimension  are
                        interpreted.   For   example,   for   dimension   type
                        TOPIC_FILTER, the  IN  operator,  a  message  will  be
                        counted  only  if  its  topic matches one of the topic
                        filters. With  NOT_IN  operator,  a  message  will  be
                        counted only if it doesn't match any of the topic fil-
                        ters. The operator is optional: if it's  not  provided
                        (is null ), it will be interpreted as IN .

                 criteria -> (structure)
                     The  criteria that determine if a device is behaving nor-
                     mally in regard to the metric .

                     comparisonOperator -> (string)
                        The operator that relates the thing measured (metric )
                        to  the  criteria  (containing  a  value  or statisti-
                        calThreshold ). Valid operators include:

                        o string-list : in-set and not-in-set

                        o number-list : in-set and not-in-set

                        o ip-address-list : in-cidr-set and not-in-cidr-set

                        o number : less-than , less-than-equals , greater-than
                          , and greater-than-equals

                     value -> (structure)
                        The value to be compared with the metric .

                        count -> (long)
                            If  the  comparisonOperator  calls  for  a numeric
                            value, use this to specify that numeric  value  to
                            be compared with the metric .

                        cidrs -> (list)
                            If  the  comparisonOperator  calls  for  a  set of
                            CIDRs, use this to specify that set to be compared
                            with the metric .

                            (string)

                        ports -> (list)
                            If  the  comparisonOperator  calls  for  a  set of
                            ports, use this to specify that set to be compared
                            with the metric .

                            (integer)

                        number -> (double)
                            The numeral value of a metric.

                        numbers -> (list)
                            The numeral values of a metric.

                            (double)

                        strings -> (list)
                            The string values of a metric.

                            (string)

                     durationSeconds -> (integer)
                        Use  this  to specify the time duration over which the
                        behavior is evaluated, for those criteria that have  a
                        time  dimension (for example, NUM_MESSAGES_SENT ). For
                        a statisticalThreshhold  metric  comparison,  measure-
                        ments  from all devices are accumulated over this time
                        duration before being used to  calculate  percentiles,
                        and  later, measurements from an individual device are
                        also accumulated over this time duration before  being
                        given   a   percentile   rank.  Cannot  be  used  with
                        list-based metric datatypes.

                     consecutiveDatapointsToAlarm -> (integer)
                        If a device is in violation of the  behavior  for  the
                        specified  number  of consecutive datapoints, an alarm
                        occurs. If not specified, the default is 1.

                     consecutiveDatapointsToClear -> (integer)
                        If an alarm has occurred and the offending  device  is
                        no  longer in violation of the behavior for the speci-
                        fied number of consecutive datapoints,  the  alarm  is
                        cleared. If not specified, the default is 1.

                     statisticalThreshold -> (structure)
                        A  statistical  ranking  (percentile)that  indicates a
                        threshold value by which a behavior is  determined  to
                        be in compliance or in violation of the behavior.

                        statistic -> (string)
                            The  percentile that resolves to a threshold value
                            by which compliance with a behavior is determined.
                            Metrics  are  collected  over the specified period
                            (durationSeconds ) from all reporting  devices  in
                            your account and statistical ranks are calculated.
                            Then, the measurements from a device are collected
                            over  the same period. If the accumulated measure-
                            ments from the device fall above or below (compar-
                            isonOperator  ) the value associated with the per-
                            centile specified, then the device  is  considered
                            to be in compliance with the behavior, otherwise a
                            violation occurs.

                 The value of the metric (the measurement).

                 count -> (long)
                     If  the comparisonOperator calls for a numeric value, use
                     this to specify that numeric value to  be  compared  with
                     the metric .

                 cidrs -> (list)
                     If  the  comparisonOperator calls for a set of CIDRs, use
                     this to specify that set to be compared with the metric .

                     (string)

                 ports -> (list)
                     If  the  comparisonOperator calls for a set of ports, use
                     this to specify that set to be compared with the metric .

                     (integer)

                 number -> (double)
                     The numeral value of a metric.
