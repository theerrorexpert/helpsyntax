NAME
       get-topic-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about the rule.

       Requires permission to access the GetTopicRule action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-topic-rule
          --rule-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rule-name (string)
          The name of the rule.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                        default value of the attribute is "RAW". SNS uses this
                        setting  to  determine if the payload should be parsed
                        and relevant platform-specific  bits  of  the  payload
                        should  be  extracted.  To read more about SNS message

                        (deprecated) The ARN of the IoT Analytics  channel  to
                        which message data will be sent.

                     channelName -> (string)
                        The name of the IoT Analytics channel to which message
                        data will be sent.

                     batchMode -> (boolean)
                        Whether to process the action as a batch. The  default
                        value is false .

                        When  batchMode  is  true  and  the rule SQL statement
                        evaluates to an Array, each Array element is delivered
                        as a separate message when passed by ` BatchPutMessage
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotanalytics/latest/APIReference/API_BatchPutMessage.html`__
                        to  the  IoT  Analytics  channel.  The resulting array

                        UUID value.

                        When batchMode is true , you can't specify a messageId
                        --a new UUID value will be assigned.

                        Assign a value to this property to  ensure  that  only
                        one  input  (message)  with  a given messageId will be
                        processed by an IoT Events detector.

                     batchMode -> (boolean)
                        Whether to process the event actions as a  batch.  The
                        default value is false .

                        When batchMode is true , you can't specify a messageId
                        .

                        When batchMode is true  and  the  rule  SQL  statement
                        evaluates  to  an Array, each Array element is treated
                        as a separate message when it's sent to IoT Events  by
                        calling                `               BatchPutMessage
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotevents/latest/apireference/API_iotevents-data_BatchPutMessage.html`__
                        .  The  resulting  array  can't have more than 10 mes-

                        precision of the Timestream  record's  timestamp.  You
                        can  specify  a  value  from  the message payload or a
                        value computed by a substitution template.

                        If omitted, the topic rule action  assigns  the  time-
                        stamp,  in  milliseconds, at the time it processed the

                            from the expression described in value .

                            Valid values: SECONDS | MILLISECONDS  |  MICROSEC-
                            ONDS | NANOSECONDS . The default is MILLISECONDS .

                        in  the URL, you must also specify a confirmationUrl .
                        If this is a new destination, a new  TopicRuleDestina-

                        value of the confirmation URL must be a prefix of  the
                        endpoint URL. If you do not specify a confirmation URL
                        IoT uses the endpoint URL as the confirmation URL.  If
                        you use substitution templates in the confirmationUrl,
                        you must create and  enable  topic  rule  destinations
                        that  match  each  possible  value of the substitution
                        template before traffic is allowed  to  your  endpoint

                     the URL, you must also specify  a  confirmationUrl  .  If
                     this  is a new destination, a new TopicRuleDestination is

                     IoT uses the endpoint URL as the confirmation URL. If you
                     use substitution templates in  the  confirmationUrl,  you
                     must create and enable topic rule destinations that match
