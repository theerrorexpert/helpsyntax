DELETE-THING-TYPE()                                        DELETE-THING-TYPE()



NAME
       delete-thing-type -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the specified thing type. You cannot delete a thing type if it
       has things associated with it. To delete a thing type, first mark it as
       deprecated  by calling  DeprecateThingType , then remove any associated
       things by calling  UpdateThing to change the thing type on any  associ-
       ated  thing, and finally use  DeleteThingType to delete the thing type.

       Requires permission to access the DeleteThingType action.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-thing-type
          --thing-type-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --thing-type-name (string)
          The name of the thing type.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
