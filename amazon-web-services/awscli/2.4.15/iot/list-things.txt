LIST-THINGS()                                                    LIST-THINGS()



NAME
       list-things -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  your things. Use the attributeName and attributeValue parameters
       to filter your things. For example, calling ListThings with  attribute-
       Name=Color  and attributeValue=Red retrieves all things in the registry
       that contain an attribute Color with the value Red .

       Requires permission to access the ListThings action.

       NOTE:
          You will not be charged for calling this API  if  an  Access  denied
          error  is returned. You will also not be charged if no attributes or
          pagination token was provided in request and no pagination token and
          no results were returned.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-things  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: things

SYNOPSIS
            list-things
          [--attribute-name <value>]
          [--attribute-value <value>]
          [--thing-type-name <value>]
          [--use-prefix-attribute-value | --no-use-prefix-attribute-value]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --attribute-name (string)
          The attribute name used to search for things.

       --attribute-value (string)
          The attribute value used to search for things.

       --thing-type-name (string)
          The name of the thing type used to search for things.

       --use-prefix-attribute-value     |      --no-use-prefix-attribute-value
       (boolean)
          When  true  ,  the action returns the thing resources with attribute
          values that start with the attributeValue provided.

          When false , or not present,  the  action  returns  only  the  thing
          resources with attribute values that match the entire attributeValue
          provided.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       Example 2: To list the defined things that have a specific attribute

       The following list-things example displays a list of things  that  have
       an attribute named wattage.

              --attribute-name wattage

       Output:
