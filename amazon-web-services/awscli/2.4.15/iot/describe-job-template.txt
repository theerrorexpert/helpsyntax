DESCRIBE-JOB-TEMPLATE()                                DESCRIBE-JOB-TEMPLATE()



NAME
       describe-job-template -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about a job template.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-job-template
          --job-template-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-template-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the job template.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       jobTemplateArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the job template.

       jobTemplateId -> (string)
          The unique identifier of the job template.

       description -> (string)
          A description of the job template.

       documentSource -> (string)
          An S3 link to the job document.

       document -> (string)
          The job document.

       createdAt -> (timestamp)
          The time, in seconds since the epoch, when the job template was cre-
          ated.

       presignedUrlConfig -> (structure)
          Configuration for pre-signed S3 URLs.

          roleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of an IAM role that grants grants permission to download
              files  from the S3 bucket where the job data/updates are stored.
              The role must also grant permission  for  IoT  to  download  the
              files.

          expiresInSec -> (long)
              How  long  (in  seconds) pre-signed URLs are valid. Valid values
              are 60 - 3600, the default value  is  3600  seconds.  Pre-signed
              URLs  are  generated  when Jobs receives an MQTT request for the
              job document.

       jobExecutionsRolloutConfig -> (structure)
          Allows you to create a staged rollout of a job.

          maximumPerMinute -> (integer)
              The maximum number of things that will be notified of a  pending
              job,  per  minute.  This parameter allows you to create a staged
              rollout.

          exponentialRate -> (structure)
              The rate of increase for a job rollout.  This  parameter  allows
              you to define an exponential rate for a job rollout.

              baseRatePerMinute -> (integer)
                 The minimum number of things that will be notified of a pend-
                 ing job, per minute at the start of job rollout. This parame-
                 ter allows you to define the initial rate of rollout.

              incrementFactor -> (double)
                 The  exponential factor to increase the rate of rollout for a
                 job.

                 Amazon Web Services IoT Core supports up to one  digit  after
                 the decimal (for example, 1.5, but not 1.55).

              rateIncreaseCriteria -> (structure)
                 The  criteria to initiate the increase in rate of rollout for
                 a job.

                 numberOfNotifiedThings -> (integer)
                     The threshold for number of  notified  things  that  will
                     initiate the increase in rate of rollout.

                 numberOfSucceededThings -> (integer)
                     The  threshold  for  number of succeeded things that will
                     initiate the increase in rate of rollout.

       abortConfig -> (structure)
          The criteria that determine when and how a job abort takes place.

          criteriaList -> (list)
              The list of criteria that determine when and how  to  abort  the
              job.

              (structure)
                 The  criteria  that  determine when and how a job abort takes
                 place.

                 failureType -> (string)
                     The type of job execution failures that  can  initiate  a
                     job abort.

                 action -> (string)
                     The type of job action to take to initiate the job abort.

                 thresholdPercentage -> (double)
                     The minimum percentage of  job  execution  failures  that
                     must occur to initiate the job abort.

                     Amazon  Web  Services  IoT Core supports up to two digits
                     after the decimal (for example, 10.9 and 10.99,  but  not
                     10.999).

                 minNumberOfExecutedThings -> (integer)
                     The  minimum number of things which must receive job exe-
                     cution notifications before the job can be aborted.

       timeoutConfig -> (structure)
          Specifies the amount of time each device has to finish its execution
          of  the job. A timer is started when the job execution status is set
          to IN_PROGRESS . If the job execution status is not set  to  another
          terminal  state  before  the timer expires, it will be automatically
          set to TIMED_OUT .

          inProgressTimeoutInMinutes -> (long)
              Specifies the amount of time, in minutes,  this  device  has  to
              finish  execution  of this job. The timeout interval can be any-
              where between 1 minute and 7 days (1 to 10080 minutes).  The  in
              progress timer can't be updated and will apply to all job execu-
              tions for the job. Whenever  a  job  execution  remains  in  the
              IN_PROGRESS status for longer than this interval, the job execu-
              tion will fail and switch to the terminal TIMED_OUT status.

       jobExecutionsRetryConfig -> (structure)
          The configuration that determines how many retries are  allowed  for
          each failure type for a job.

          criteriaList -> (list)
              The  list  of  criteria  that  determines  how  many retries are
              allowed for each failure type for a job.

              (structure)
                 The criteria that determines how many retries are allowed for
                 each failure type for a job.

                 failureType -> (string)
                     The  type  of  job execution failures that can initiate a
                     job retry.

                 numberOfRetries -> (integer)
                     The number of retries allowed for a failure type for  the
                     job.
