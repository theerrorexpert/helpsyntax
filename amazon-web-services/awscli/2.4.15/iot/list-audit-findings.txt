LIST-AUDIT-FINDINGS()                                    LIST-AUDIT-FINDINGS()



NAME
       list-audit-findings -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  findings  (results)  of  a  Device Defender audit or of the
       audits performed during a specified time period. (Findings are retained
       for 90 days.)

       Requires permission to access the ListAuditFindings action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-audit-findings is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: findings

       Shorthand Syntax:

          deviceCertificateId=string,caCertificateId=string,cognitoIdentityPoolId=string,clientId=string,policyVersionIdentifier={policyName=string,policyVersionId=string},account=string,iamRoleArn=string,roleAliasArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "deviceCertificateId": "string",
            "caCertificateId": "string",
            "cognitoIdentityPoolId": "string",
            "clientId": "string",
            "policyVersionIdentifier": {
              "policyName": "string",
              "policyVersionId": "string"
            },
            "account": "string",
            "iamRoleArn": "string",
            "roleAliasArn": "string"
          }

       --start-time (timestamp)
          A  filter  to limit results to those found after the specified time.
          You must specify either the startTime and endTime or the taskId, but
          not both.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          A  filter to limit results to those found before the specified time.
          You must specify either the startTime and endTime or the taskId, but
          not both.

       --list-suppressed-findings | --no-list-suppressed-findings (boolean)
          Boolean  flag indicating whether only the suppressed findings or the
          unsuppressed findings should be listed. If this parameter isn't pro-
          vided, the response will list both suppressed and unsuppressed find-
          ings.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To list all findings from an audit

       The  following  list-audit-findings  example lists all findings from an
       AWS IoT Device Defender audit with a specified task ID.

          aws iot list-audit-findings \
              --task-id a3aea009955e501a31b764abe1bebd3d

       Output:

          {
              "findings": []
          }

       Example 2: To list findings for an audit check type

       The following list-audit-findings example shows findings from  AWS  IoT
       Device  Defender audits that ran between June 5, 2019 and June 19, 2019
       in which devices are sharing a device certificate. When you  specify  a
       check name, you must provide a start and end time.

          aws iot list-audit-findings \
              --check-name DEVICE_CERTIFICATE_SHARED_CHECK \
              --start-time 1559747125 \
              --end-time 1560962028
