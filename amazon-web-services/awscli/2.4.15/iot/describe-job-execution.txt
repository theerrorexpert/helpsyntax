DESCRIBE-JOB-EXECUTION()                              DESCRIBE-JOB-EXECUTION()



NAME
       describe-job-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes a job execution.

       Requires permission to access the DescribeJobExecution action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-job-execution
          --job-id <value>
          --thing-name <value>
          [--execution-number <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The  unique identifier you assigned to this job when it was created.

       --thing-name (string)
          The name of the thing on which the job execution is running.

       --execution-number (long)
          A string (consisting of the digits "0" through "9" which is used  to
          specify a particular job execution on a particular device.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get execution details for a job on a device

       The following describe-job-execution example gets execution details for
       the specified job.

          aws iot describe-job-execution \
              --job-id "example-job-01" \
              --thing-name "MyRaspberryPi"

       Output:

          {
              "execution": {
                  "jobId": "example-job-01",
                  "status": "QUEUED",
                  "statusDetails": {},
                  "thingArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:thing/MyRaspberryPi",
                  "queuedAt": 1560787023.636,
                  "lastUpdatedAt": 1560787023.636,
                  "executionNumber": 1,
                  "versionNumber": 1
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       execution -> (structure)
          Information about the job execution.

          jobId -> (string)
              The  unique  identifier you assigned to the job when it was cre-
              ated.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the job execution  (IN_PROGRESS,  QUEUED,  FAILED,
              SUCCEEDED, TIMED_OUT, CANCELED, or REJECTED).

          forceCanceled -> (boolean)
              Will be true if the job execution was canceled with the optional
              force parameter set to true .

          statusDetails -> (structure)
              A collection of name/value pairs that describe the status of the
              job execution.

              detailsMap -> (map)
                 The job execution status.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

          thingArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the thing on which the job execution is running.

          queuedAt -> (timestamp)
              The time, in seconds since the epoch, when the job execution was
              queued.

          startedAt -> (timestamp)
              The time, in seconds since the epoch,  when  the  job  execution
              started.

          lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The time, in seconds since the epoch, when the job execution was
              last updated.

          executionNumber -> (long)
              A string (consisting of the digits "0" through "9") which  iden-
              tifies  this particular job execution on this particular device.
              It can be used in commands which return or update job  execution
              information.

          versionNumber -> (long)
              The  version  of  the  job execution. Job execution versions are
              incremented each time they are updated by a device.

          approximateSecondsBeforeTimedOut -> (long)
              The estimated number of seconds that remain before the job  exe-
              cution  status will be changed to TIMED_OUT . The timeout inter-
              val can be anywhere between 1 minute and 7 days (1 to 10080 min-
              utes).  The actual job execution timeout can occur up to 60 sec-
              onds later than the estimated duration. This value will  not  be
              included if the job execution has reached a terminal status.
