DESCRIBE-AUDIT-FINDING()                              DESCRIBE-AUDIT-FINDING()



NAME
       describe-audit-finding -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  information  about a single audit finding. Properties include the
       reason for noncompliance, the severity of the issue, and the start time
       when the audit that returned the finding.

       Requires permission to access the DescribeAuditFinding action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-audit-finding
          --finding-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --finding-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for  a single audit finding. You can use this
          identifier to apply mitigation actions to the finding.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list details for an audit finding

       The following describe-audit-finding example lists the details for  the
       specified  AWS  IoT Device Defender audit finding. An audit can produce
       multiple findings. Use the list-audit-findings command to get a list of
       the findings from an audit to get the findingId.

          aws iot describe-audit-finding \
              --finding-id "ef4826b8-e55a-44b9-b460-5c485355371b"
