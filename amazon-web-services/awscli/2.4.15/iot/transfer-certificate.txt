TRANSFER-CERTIFICATE()                                  TRANSFER-CERTIFICATE()



NAME
       transfer-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Transfers  the  specified  certificate to the specified Amazon Web Ser-
       vices account.

       Requires permission to access the TransferCertificate action.

       You can cancel the transfer until it is acknowledged by the  recipient.

       No notification is sent to the transfer destination's account. It is up
       to the caller to notify the transfer target.

       The certificate being transferred must not be in the ACTIVE state.  You
       can use the  UpdateCertificate action to deactivate it.

       The  certificate must not have any policies attached to it. You can use
       the  DetachPolicy action to detach them.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            transfer-certificate
          --certificate-id <value>
          --target-aws-account <value>
          [--transfer-message <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-id (string)
          The ID of the certificate. (The last part  of  the  certificate  ARN
          contains the certificate ID.)

       --target-aws-account (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account.

       --transfer-message (string)
          The transfer message.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To transfer a device certificate to a different AWS account

       The  following transfer-certificate example transfers a device certifi-
       cate to another AWS account. The certificate and AWS account are  iden-
       tified by ID.

          aws iot transfer-certificate \
              --certificate-id 488b6a7f2acdeb00a77384e63c4e40b18b1b3caaae57b7272ba44c45e3448142 \
              --target-aws-account 030714055129

       Output:

          {
              "transferredCertificateArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:030714055129:cert/488b6a7f2acdeb00a77384e63c4e40b18b1b3caaae57b7272ba44c45e3448142"
          }

       For  more information, see Transfer a certificate to another account in
       the AWS IoT Core Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       transferredCertificateArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the certificate.
