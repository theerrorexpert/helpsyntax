DELETE-CERTIFICATE()                                      DELETE-CERTIFICATE()



NAME
       delete-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the specified certificate.

       A  certificate  cannot  be  deleted  if  it  has  a policy or IoT thing
       attached to it or if its status is set to ACTIVE. To delete a  certifi-
       cate,  first use the  DetachPolicy action to detach all policies. Next,
       use the  UpdateCertificate action to set the certificate to  the  INAC-
       TIVE status.

       Requires permission to access the DeleteCertificate action.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-certificate
          --certificate-id <value>
          [--force-delete | --no-force-delete]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the  certificate. (The last part of the certificate ARN
          contains the certificate ID.)

       --force-delete | --no-force-delete (boolean)
          Forces the deletion of a certificate if it is inactive  and  is  not
          attached to an IoT thing.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
