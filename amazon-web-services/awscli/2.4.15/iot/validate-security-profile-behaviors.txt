DESCRIPTION
       Validates a Device Defender security profile behaviors specification.

       Requires  permission  to  access  the  ValidateSecurityProfileBehaviors
       action.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            validate-security-profile-behaviors
          --behaviors <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --behaviors (list)
          Specifies the behaviors that, when violated  by  a  device  (thing),
          cause an alert.

          (structure)
              A Device Defender security profile behavior.

              name -> (string)
                 The name you've given to the behavior.

              metric -> (string)
                 What is measured by the behavior.

              metricDimension -> (structure)
                 The  dimension  for  a  metric in your behavior. For example,
                 using a TOPIC_FILTER dimension, you can narrow down the scope
                 of  the metric to only MQTT topics where the name matches the
                 pattern specified in the dimension. This can't be  used  with
                 custom metrics.

                 dimensionName -> (string)
                     A unique identifier for the dimension.

                 operator -> (string)
                     Defines how the dimensionValues of a dimension are inter-
                     preted. For example, for dimension type TOPIC_FILTER, the
                     IN  operator, a message will be counted only if its topic
                     matches one of the topic filters. With NOT_IN operator, a
                     message  will  be counted only if it doesn't match any of
                     the topic filters. The operator is optional: if it's  not
                     provided (is null ), it will be interpreted as IN .

              criteria -> (structure)
                 The  criteria that determine if a device is behaving normally
                 in regard to the metric .

                 comparisonOperator -> (string)
                     The operator that relates the thing measured (metric ) to
                     the  criteria (containing a value or statisticalThreshold
                     ). Valid operators include:

                     o string-list : in-set and not-in-set

                     o number-list : in-set and not-in-set

                     o ip-address-list : in-cidr-set and not-in-cidr-set

                     o number : less-than , less-than-equals , greater-than  ,
                       and greater-than-equals

                 value -> (structure)
                     The value to be compared with the metric .

                     count -> (long)
                        If  the  comparisonOperator calls for a numeric value,
                        use this to specify that numeric value to be  compared
                        with the metric .

                     cidrs -> (list)
                        If  the  comparisonOperator  calls for a set of CIDRs,
                        use this to specify that set to be compared  with  the
                        metric .

                        (string)

                     ports -> (list)
                        If  the  comparisonOperator  calls for a set of ports,
                        use this to specify that set to be compared  with  the
                        metric .

                        (integer)

                     number -> (double)
                        The numeral value of a metric.

                     numbers -> (list)
                        The numeral values of a metric.

                        (double)

                     strings -> (list)
                        The string values of a metric.

                        (string)

                 durationSeconds -> (integer)
                     Use  this  to  specify  the  time duration over which the
                     behavior is evaluated, for those  criteria  that  have  a
                     time  dimension  (for example, NUM_MESSAGES_SENT ). For a
                     statisticalThreshhold  metric  comparison,   measurements
                     from  all devices are accumulated over this time duration
                     before being used to calculate  percentiles,  and  later,
                     measurements  from  an individual device are also accumu-
                     lated over this time duration before being given  a  per-
                     centile  rank.  Cannot  be  used  with  list-based metric
                     datatypes.

                 consecutiveDatapointsToAlarm -> (integer)
                     If a device is in violation of the behavior for the spec-
                     ified  number of consecutive datapoints, an alarm occurs.
                     If not specified, the default is 1.

                 consecutiveDatapointsToClear -> (integer)
                     If an alarm has occurred and the offending device  is  no
                     longer  in  violation  of  the behavior for the specified
                     number of consecutive datapoints, the alarm  is  cleared.
                     If not specified, the default is 1.

                 statisticalThreshold -> (structure)
                     A   statistical   ranking  (percentile)that  indicates  a
                     threshold value by which a behavior is determined  to  be
                     in compliance or in violation of the behavior.

                     statistic -> (string)
                        The  percentile  that resolves to a threshold value by
                        which compliance with a behavior is  determined.  Met-
                        rics  are  collected  over the specified period (dura-
                        tionSeconds )  from  all  reporting  devices  in  your
                        account  and  statistical  ranks are calculated. Then,
                        the measurements from a device are collected over  the
                        same  period. If the accumulated measurements from the
                        device fall above or below (comparisonOperator  )  the
                        value  associated  with the percentile specified, then
                        the device is considered to be in compliance with  the
                        behavior, otherwise a violation occurs.

                 mlDetectionConfig -> (structure)
                     The configuration of an ML Detect

                     confidenceLevel -> (string)
                        The  sensitivity of anomalous behavior evaluation. Can
                        be Low , Medium , or High .

              suppressAlerts -> (boolean)
                 Suppresses alerts.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
