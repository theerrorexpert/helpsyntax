LIST-JOBS()                                                        LIST-JOBS()



NAME
       list-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists jobs.

       Requires permission to access the ListJobs action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in
       order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagi-
       nation  by  providing  the --no-paginate argument.  When using --output
       text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: jobs

SYNOPSIS
            list-jobs
          [--status <value>]
          [--target-selection <value>]
          [--thing-group-name <value>]
          [--thing-group-id <value>]
          [--namespace-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --status (string)
          An optional filter that lets you search for jobs that have the spec-
          ified status.

          Possible values:

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o CANCELED

          o COMPLETED

          o DELETION_IN_PROGRESS

       --target-selection (string)
          Specifies whether the job will continue to run (CONTINUOUS), or will
          be complete after all those things specified as  targets  have  com-
          pleted the job (SNAPSHOT). If continuous, the job may also be run on
          a thing when a change is detected in a target. For  example,  a  job
          will  run on a thing when the thing is added to a target group, even
          after the job was completed by all things originally in the group.

          Possible values:

          o CONTINUOUS

          o SNAPSHOT

       --thing-group-name (string)
          A filter that limits the returned jobs to those  for  the  specified
          group.

       --thing-group-id (string)
          A  filter  that  limits the returned jobs to those for the specified
          group.

       --namespace-id (string)
          The namespace used to indicate that a job is a customer-managed job.

          When you specify a value for this parameter, Amazon Web Services IoT
          Core sends jobs notifications to MQTT topics that contain the  value
          in the following format.
              $aws/things/*THING_NAME*      /jobs/*JOB_ID*      /notify-names-
              pace-*NAMESPACE_ID* /

          NOTE:
              The namespaceId feature is in public preview.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the jobs in your AWS account

       The  following  list-jobs  example  lists all jobs in your AWS account,
       sorted by the job status.

          aws iot list-jobs

       Output:

          {
              "jobs": [
                  {
                      "jobArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:job/example-job-01",
                      "jobId": "example-job-01",
                      "targetSelection": "SNAPSHOT",
                      "status": "IN_PROGRESS",
                      "createdAt": 1560787022.733,
                      "lastUpdatedAt": 1560787026.294
                  }
              ]
          }

              jobArn -> (string)
                 The job ARN.

              jobId -> (string)
                 The  unique  identifier  you assigned to this job when it was
                 created.

              thingGroupId -> (string)
