LIST-AUDIT-MITIGATION-ACTIONS-EXECUTLIST-AUDIT-MITIGATION-ACTIONS-EXECUTIONS()



NAME
       list-audit-mitigation-actions-executions -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the status of audit mitigation action tasks that were executed.

       Requires  permission to access the ListAuditMitigationActionsExecutions
       action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-audit-mitigation-actions-executions is a paginated operation. Mul-
       tiple  API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set
       of results. You can disable pagination by providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: actionsExecutions

SYNOPSIS
            list-audit-mitigation-actions-executions
          --task-id <value>
          [--action-status <value>]
          --finding-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --task-id (string)
          Specify this filter to limit results to actions for a specific audit
          mitigation actions task.

       --action-status (string)
          Specify this filter to limit results to those with a  specific  sta-
          tus.

          Possible values:

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o COMPLETED

          o FAILED

          o CANCELED

          o SKIPPED

          o PENDING

       --finding-id (string)
          Specify this filter to limit results to those that were applied to a
          specific audit finding.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the details of an audit mitigation action execution

       An  audit  mitigation action task applies a mitigation action to one or
       more findings from an AWS IoT  Device  Defender  audit.  The  following
       list-audit-mitigation-actions-executions  example lists the details for
       the mitigation action task with the specified taskId and for the speci-
       fied finding.

          aws iot list-audit-mitigation-actions-executions \
              --task-id myActionsTaskId \
              --finding-id 0edbaaec-2fe1-4cf5-abc9-d4c3e51f7464

       Output:

          {
              "actionsExecutions": [
                  {
                      "taskId": "myActionsTaskId",
                      "findingId": "0edbaaec-2fe1-4cf5-abc9-d4c3e51f7464",
                      "actionName": "ResetPolicyVersionAction",
                      "actionId": "1ea0b415-bef1-4a01-bd13-72fb63c59afb",
                      "status": "COMPLETED",
                      "startTime": "2019-12-10T15:19:13.279000-08:00",
                      "endTime": "2019-12-10T15:19:13.337000-08:00"
                  }
              ]
          }

       tion Action Commands) in the AWS IoT Developer Guide.
