UPDATE-CERTIFICATE()                                      UPDATE-CERTIFICATE()



NAME
       update-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the  status  of  the  specified certificate. This operation is
       idempotent.

       Requires permission to access the UpdateCertificate action.

       Certificates must be in the ACTIVE state to authenticate  devices  that
       use a certificate to connect to IoT.

       Within a few minutes of updating a certificate from the ACTIVE state to
       any other state, IoT disconnects all devices that used that certificate
       to  connect. Devices cannot use a certificate that is not in the ACTIVE
       state to reconnect.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-certificate
          --certificate-id <value>
          --new-status <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-id (string)
          The ID of the certificate. (The last part  of  the  certificate  ARN
          contains the certificate ID.)

       --new-status (string)
          The new status.
              Note:  Setting the status to PENDING_TRANSFER or PENDING_ACTIVA-
              TION will result in an exception being thrown.  PENDING_TRANSFER
              and PENDING_ACTIVATION are statuses used internally by IoT. They
              are not intended for developer use.

              Note: The  status  value  REGISTER_INACTIVE  is  deprecated  and
              should not be used.

          Possible values:

          o ACTIVE

          o INACTIVE

          o REVOKED

          o PENDING_TRANSFER

          o REGISTER_INACTIVE

          o PENDING_ACTIVATION

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update a device certificate

       The following update-certificate example sets the specified device cer-
       tificate to INACTIVE status.

          aws iot update-certificate \
              --certificate-id d1eb269fb55a628552143c8f96eb3c258fcd5331ea113e766ba0c82bf225f0be \
              --new-status INACTIVE

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       None
