OPTIONS
       --security-profile-name (string)
          The name of the security profile you want to update.

       --security-profile-description (string)
          A description of the security profile.

       --behaviors (list)
          Specifies  the  behaviors  that,  when violated by a device (thing),
          cause an alert.

          (structure)
              A Device Defender security profile behavior.

              name -> (string)
                 The name you've given to the behavior.

              metric -> (string)
                 What is measured by the behavior.

              metricDimension -> (structure)
                 The dimension for a metric in  your  behavior.  For  example,
                 using a TOPIC_FILTER dimension, you can narrow down the scope
                 of the metric to only MQTT topics where the name matches  the
                 pattern  specified  in the dimension. This can't be used with
                 custom metrics.

                 dimensionName -> (string)
                     A unique identifier for the dimension.

                 operator -> (string)
                     Defines how the dimensionValues of a dimension are inter-
                     preted. For example, for dimension type TOPIC_FILTER, the
                     IN operator, a message will be counted only if its  topic
                     matches one of the topic filters. With NOT_IN operator, a
                     message will be counted only if it doesn't match  any  of
                     the  topic filters. The operator is optional: if it's not
                     provided (is null ), it will be interpreted as IN .

              criteria -> (structure)
                 The criteria that determine if a device is behaving  normally
                 in regard to the metric .

                 comparisonOperator -> (string)
                     The operator that relates the thing measured (metric ) to
                     the criteria (containing a value or  statisticalThreshold
                     ). Valid operators include:

                     o string-list : in-set and not-in-set

                     o number-list : in-set and not-in-set

                     o ip-address-list : in-cidr-set and not-in-cidr-set

                     o number  : less-than , less-than-equals , greater-than ,
                       and greater-than-equals

                 value -> (structure)
                     The value to be compared with the metric .

                     count -> (long)
                        If the comparisonOperator calls for a  numeric  value,
                        use  this to specify that numeric value to be compared
                        with the metric .

                     cidrs -> (list)
                        If the comparisonOperator calls for a  set  of  CIDRs,
                        use  this  to specify that set to be compared with the
                        metric .

                        (string)

                     ports -> (list)
                        If the comparisonOperator calls for a  set  of  ports,
                        use  this  to specify that set to be compared with the
                        metric .

                        (integer)

                     number -> (double)
                        The numeral value of a metric.

                     numbers -> (list)
                        The numeral values of a metric.

                        (double)

                     strings -> (list)
                        The string values of a metric.

                        (string)

                 durationSeconds -> (integer)
                     Use this to specify the  time  duration  over  which  the
                     behavior  is  evaluated,  for  those criteria that have a
                     time dimension (for example, NUM_MESSAGES_SENT ).  For  a
                     statisticalThreshhold   metric  comparison,  measurements
                     from all devices are accumulated over this time  duration
                     before  being  used  to calculate percentiles, and later,
                     measurements from an individual device are  also  accumu-
                     lated  over  this time duration before being given a per-
                     centile rank.  Cannot  be  used  with  list-based  metric
                     datatypes.

                 consecutiveDatapointsToAlarm -> (integer)
                     If a device is in violation of the behavior for the spec-
                     ified number of consecutive datapoints, an alarm  occurs.
                     If not specified, the default is 1.

                 consecutiveDatapointsToClear -> (integer)
                     If  an  alarm has occurred and the offending device is no
                     longer in violation of the  behavior  for  the  specified
                     number  of  consecutive datapoints, the alarm is cleared.
                     If not specified, the default is 1.

                 statisticalThreshold -> (structure)
                     A  statistical  ranking  (percentile)that   indicates   a
                     threshold  value  by which a behavior is determined to be
                     in compliance or in violation of the behavior.

                     statistic -> (string)
                        The percentile that resolves to a threshold  value  by
                        which  compliance  with a behavior is determined. Met-
                        rics are collected over the  specified  period  (dura-
                        tionSeconds  )  from  all  reporting  devices  in your
                        account and statistical ranks  are  calculated.  Then,
                        the  measurements from a device are collected over the
                        same period. If the accumulated measurements from  the
                        device  fall  above or below (comparisonOperator ) the
                        value associated with the percentile  specified,  then
                        the  device is considered to be in compliance with the
                        behavior, otherwise a violation occurs.

                 mlDetectionConfig -> (structure)
                     The configuration of an ML Detect

                     confidenceLevel -> (string)
                        The sensitivity of anomalous behavior evaluation.  Can
                        be Low , Medium , or High .

              suppressAlerts -> (boolean)
                 Suppresses alerts.

       --additional-metrics-to-retain (list)
              Please use   UpdateSecurityProfileRequest$additionalMetricsToRe-
              tainV2 instead.

          A  list of metrics whose data is retained (stored). By default, data
          is retained for any metric used in the profile's behaviors , but  it
          is  also  retained  for  any metric specified here. Can be used with
          custom metrics; cannot be used with dimensions.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --additional-metrics-to-retain-v2 (list)
          A list of metrics whose data is retained (stored). By default,  data
          is  retained  for any metric used in the profile's behaviors, but it
          is also retained for any metric specified here.  Can  be  used  with
          custom metrics; cannot be used with dimensions.

          (structure)
              The metric you want to retain. Dimensions are optional.

              metric -> (string)
                 What is measured by the behavior.

              metricDimension -> (structure)
                 The  dimension  of  a  metric. This can't be used with custom
                 metrics.

                 dimensionName -> (string)
                     A unique identifier for the dimension.

                 operator -> (string)
                     Defines how the dimensionValues of a dimension are inter-
                     preted. For example, for dimension type TOPIC_FILTER, the
                     IN operator, a message will be counted only if its  topic
                     matches one of the topic filters. With NOT_IN operator, a
                     message will be counted only if it doesn't match  any  of
                     the  topic filters. The operator is optional: if it's not
                     provided (is null ), it will be interpreted as IN .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          metric=string,metricDimension={dimensionName=string,operator=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "metric": "string",
              "metricDimension": {

              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --delete-behaviors | --no-delete-behaviors (boolean)
          If true, delete all behaviors defined for this security profile.  If
          any  behaviors  are  defined in the current invocation, an exception
          occurs.

       --delete-alert-targets | --no-delete-alert-targets (boolean)
          If true, delete all alertTargets defined for this security  profile.
          If any alertTargets are defined in the current invocation, an excep-
          tion occurs.

       --delete-additional-metrics-to-retain   |   --no-delete-additional-met-
       rics-to-retain (boolean)
          If true, delete all additionalMetricsToRetain defined for this secu-
          rity profile. If any additionalMetricsToRetain are  defined  in  the
          current invocation, an exception occurs.

       --expected-version (long)
          The  expected version of the security profile. A new version is gen-
          erated whenever the security profile is updated. If  you  specify  a
          value  that  is  different  from  the  actual version, a VersionCon-
          flictException is thrown.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       securityProfileDescription -> (string)
          The description of the security profile.

       behaviors -> (list)
          Specifies  the  behaviors  that,  when violated by a device (thing),
          cause an alert.

          (structure)
              A Device Defender security profile behavior.

              name -> (string)
                 The name you've given to the behavior.

              metric -> (string)
                 What is measured by the behavior.

              metricDimension -> (structure)
                 The dimension for a metric in  your  behavior.  For  example,
                 using a TOPIC_FILTER dimension, you can narrow down the scope
                 of the metric to only MQTT topics where the name matches  the
                 pattern  specified  in the dimension. This can't be used with
                 custom metrics.

                 dimensionName -> (string)
                     A unique identifier for the dimension.

                 operator -> (string)
                     Defines how the dimensionValues of a dimension are inter-
                     preted. For example, for dimension type TOPIC_FILTER, the
                     IN operator, a message will be counted only if its  topic
                     matches one of the topic filters. With NOT_IN operator, a
                     message will be counted only if it doesn't match  any  of
                     the  topic filters. The operator is optional: if it's not
                     provided (is null ), it will be interpreted as IN .

              criteria -> (structure)
                 The criteria that determine if a device is behaving  normally
                 in regard to the metric .

                 comparisonOperator -> (string)
                     The operator that relates the thing measured (metric ) to
                     the criteria (containing a value or  statisticalThreshold
                     ). Valid operators include:

                     o string-list : in-set and not-in-set

                     o number-list : in-set and not-in-set

                     o ip-address-list : in-cidr-set and not-in-cidr-set

                     o number  : less-than , less-than-equals , greater-than ,
                       and greater-than-equals

                 value -> (structure)
                     The value to be compared with the metric .

                     count -> (long)
                        If the comparisonOperator calls for a  numeric  value,
                        use  this to specify that numeric value to be compared
                        with the metric .

                     cidrs -> (list)
                        If the comparisonOperator calls for a  set  of  CIDRs,
                        use  this  to specify that set to be compared with the
                        metric .

                        (string)

                     ports -> (list)
                        If the comparisonOperator calls for a  set  of  ports,
                        use  this  to specify that set to be compared with the
                        metric .

                        (integer)

                     number -> (double)
                        The numeral value of a metric.

                     numbers -> (list)

                        (double)

                     strings -> (list)
                        The string values of a metric.

                 durationSeconds -> (integer)
                     Use this to specify the  time  duration  over  which  the
                     behavior  is  evaluated,  for  those criteria that have a
                     time dimension (for example, NUM_MESSAGES_SENT ).  For  a
                     statisticalThreshhold   metric  comparison,  measurements
                     from all devices are accumulated over this time  duration
                     before  being  used  to calculate percentiles, and later,
                     measurements from an individual device are  also  accumu-
                     lated  over  this time duration before being given a per-
                     centile rank.  Cannot  be  used  with  list-based  metric
                     datatypes.

                 consecutiveDatapointsToAlarm -> (integer)
                     If a device is in violation of the behavior for the spec-
                     ified number of consecutive datapoints, an alarm  occurs.
                     If not specified, the default is 1.

                 consecutiveDatapointsToClear -> (integer)
                     If  an  alarm has occurred and the offending device is no
                     longer in violation of the  behavior  for  the  specified
                     number  of  consecutive datapoints, the alarm is cleared.
                     If not specified, the default is 1.

                 statisticalThreshold -> (structure)
                     A  statistical  ranking  (percentile)that   indicates   a
                     threshold  value  by which a behavior is determined to be
                     in compliance or in violation of the behavior.

                     statistic -> (string)
                        The percentile that resolves to a threshold  value  by
                        which  compliance  with a behavior is determined. Met-
                        rics are collected over the  specified  period  (dura-
                        tionSeconds  )  from  all  reporting  devices  in your
                        account and statistical ranks  are  calculated.  Then,
                        the  measurements from a device are collected over the
                        same period. If the accumulated measurements from  the
                        device  fall  above or below (comparisonOperator ) the
                        value associated with the percentile  specified,  then
                        the  device is considered to be in compliance with the
                        behavior, otherwise a violation occurs.

                 mlDetectionConfig -> (structure)
                     The configuration of an ML Detect

                     confidenceLevel -> (string)

                        be Low , Medium , or High .

              suppressAlerts -> (boolean)
                 Suppresses alerts.

       alertTargets -> (map)
          Where  the alerts are sent. (Alerts are always sent to the console.)

                 which alerts are sent.

              roleArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN of the role that grants permission to send alerts to
                 the notification target.

       additionalMetricsToRetain -> (list)

              tainV2 instead.

          A  list of metrics whose data is retained (stored). By default, data
          is retained for any metric used in the security profile's  behaviors
          , but it is also retained for any metric specified here.

          (string)

       additionalMetricsToRetainV2 -> (list)
          A  list of metrics whose data is retained (stored). By default, data
          is retained for any metric used in the profile's behaviors,  but  it
          is  also  retained  for  any metric specified here. Can be used with
          custom metrics; cannot be used with dimensions.

                     Defines how the dimensionValues of a dimension are inter-
                     preted. For example, for dimension type TOPIC_FILTER, the
                     IN  operator, a message will be counted only if its topic
                     matches one of the topic filters. With NOT_IN operator, a
                     message  will  be counted only if it doesn't match any of
                     the topic filters. The operator is optional: if it's  not
                     provided (is null ), it will be interpreted as IN .
