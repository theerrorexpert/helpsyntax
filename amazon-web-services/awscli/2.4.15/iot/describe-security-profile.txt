NAME
       describe-security-profile -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about a Device Defender security profile.

       Requires permission to access the DescribeSecurityProfile action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-security-profile
          --security-profile-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --security-profile-name (string)
          The  name of the security profile whose information you want to get.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about a security profile

       The following describe-security-profile example gets information  about
       the AWS IoT Device Defender security profile named PossibleIssue.

          aws iot describe-security-profile \
              --security-profile-name PossibleIssue

OUTPUT
       securityProfileName -> (string)
          The name of the security profile.

       securityProfileArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the security profile.

       securityProfileDescription -> (string)
          A description of the security profile (associated with the  security
          profile when it was created or updated).

       behaviors -> (list)
          Specifies  the  behaviors  that,  when violated by a device (thing),
          cause an alert.

          (structure)
              A Device Defender security profile behavior.

              name -> (string)
                 The name you've given to the behavior.

              metric -> (string)
                 What is measured by the behavior.

              metricDimension -> (structure)
                 The dimension for a metric in  your  behavior.  For  example,
                 using a TOPIC_FILTER dimension, you can narrow down the scope
                 of the metric to only MQTT topics where the name matches  the
                 pattern  specified  in the dimension. This can't be used with
                 custom metrics.

                 dimensionName -> (string)
                     A unique identifier for the dimension.

                 operator -> (string)
                     Defines how the dimensionValues of a dimension are inter-
                     preted. For example, for dimension type TOPIC_FILTER, the
                     IN operator, a message will be counted only if its  topic
                     matches one of the topic filters. With NOT_IN operator, a
                     message will be counted only if it doesn't match  any  of
                     the  topic filters. The operator is optional: if it's not
                     provided (is null ), it will be interpreted as IN .

              criteria -> (structure)
                 The criteria that determine if a device is behaving  normally
                 in regard to the metric .

                 comparisonOperator -> (string)
                     The operator that relates the thing measured (metric ) to
                     the criteria (containing a value or  statisticalThreshold
                     ). Valid operators include:

                     o string-list : in-set and not-in-set

                     o number-list : in-set and not-in-set

                     o ip-address-list : in-cidr-set and not-in-cidr-set

                     o number  : less-than , less-than-equals , greater-than ,
                       and greater-than-equals

                 value -> (structure)
                     The value to be compared with the metric .

                     count -> (long)
                        If the comparisonOperator calls for a  numeric  value,
                        use  this to specify that numeric value to be compared
                        with the metric .

                     cidrs -> (list)
                        If the comparisonOperator calls for a  set  of  CIDRs,
                        use  this  to specify that set to be compared with the
                        metric .

                        (string)

                     ports -> (list)
                        If the comparisonOperator calls for a  set  of  ports,
                        use  this  to specify that set to be compared with the
                        metric .

                        (integer)

                     number -> (double)
                        The numeral value of a metric.

                     numbers -> (list)
                        The numeral values of a metric.

                        (double)

                     strings -> (list)
                        The string values of a metric.

                        (string)

                 durationSeconds -> (integer)
                     Use this to specify the  time  duration  over  which  the
                     behavior  is  evaluated,  for  those criteria that have a
                     time dimension (for example, NUM_MESSAGES_SENT ).  For  a
                     statisticalThreshhold   metric  comparison,  measurements
                     from all devices are accumulated over this time  duration
                     before  being  used  to calculate percentiles, and later,
                     measurements from an individual device are  also  accumu-
                     lated  over  this time duration before being given a per-
                     centile rank.  Cannot  be  used  with  list-based  metric
                     datatypes.

                 consecutiveDatapointsToAlarm -> (integer)
                     If a device is in violation of the behavior for the spec-
                     ified number of consecutive datapoints, an alarm  occurs.
                     If not specified, the default is 1.

                 consecutiveDatapointsToClear -> (integer)
                     If  an  alarm has occurred and the offending device is no
                     longer in violation of the  behavior  for  the  specified
                     number  of  consecutive datapoints, the alarm is cleared.
                     If not specified, the default is 1.

                 statisticalThreshold -> (structure)
                     A  statistical  ranking  (percentile)that   indicates   a
                     threshold  value  by which a behavior is determined to be
                     in compliance or in violation of the behavior.

                     statistic -> (string)
                        The percentile that resolves to a threshold  value  by
                        which  compliance  with a behavior is determined. Met-
                        rics are collected over the  specified  period  (dura-
                        tionSeconds  )  from  all  reporting  devices  in your
                        account and statistical ranks  are  calculated.  Then,
                        the  measurements from a device are collected over the
                        same period. If the accumulated measurements from  the
                        device  fall  above or below (comparisonOperator ) the
                        value associated with the percentile  specified,  then
                        the  device is considered to be in compliance with the
                        behavior, otherwise a violation occurs.

                 mlDetectionConfig -> (structure)
                     The configuration of an ML Detect

                     confidenceLevel -> (string)
                        The sensitivity of anomalous behavior evaluation.  Can
                        be Low , Medium , or High .

              suppressAlerts -> (boolean)
                 Suppresses alerts.

       alertTargets -> (map)
          Where  the alerts are sent. (Alerts are always sent to the console.)

          key -> (string)
              The type of alert target: one of "SNS".

          value -> (structure)

                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the notification target  to
                 which alerts are sent.

              roleArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN of the role that grants permission to send alerts to
                 the notification target.

       additionalMetricsToRetain -> (list)
              Please  use    DescribeSecurityProfileResponse$additionalMetric-
              sToRetainV2 instead.

          A  list of metrics whose data is retained (stored). By default, data
          is retained for any metric used in the profile's behaviors , but  it
          is also retained for any metric specified here.

          (string)

       additionalMetricsToRetainV2 -> (list)
          A  list of metrics whose data is retained (stored). By default, data
          is retained for any metric used in the profile's behaviors,  but  it
          is also retained for any metric specified here.

          (structure)
              The metric you want to retain. Dimensions are optional.

              metric -> (string)
                 What is measured by the behavior.

              metricDimension -> (structure)
                 The  dimension  of  a  metric. This can't be used with custom

                 dimensionName -> (string)
                     A unique identifier for the dimension.

                 operator -> (string)
                     Defines how the dimensionValues of a dimension are inter-
                     preted. For example, for dimension type TOPIC_FILTER, the
                     IN operator, a message will be counted only if its  topic
                     matches one of the topic filters. With NOT_IN operator, a
                     message will be counted only if it doesn't match  any  of
                     the  topic filters. The operator is optional: if it's not
                     provided (is null ), it will be interpreted as IN .
