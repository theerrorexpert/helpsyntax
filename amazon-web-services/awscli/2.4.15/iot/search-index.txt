NAME
       search-index -

DESCRIPTION
       The query search index.

       Requires permission to access the SearchIndex action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            search-index
          [--index-name <value>]
          --query-string <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--query-version <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --index-name (string)
          The search index name.

       --query-string (string)
          The search query string.

       --next-token (string)
          The  token used to get the next set of results, or null if there are
          no additional results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return at one time.

       --query-version (string)
          The query version.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To query the thing index

       The following search-index example queries  the  AWS_Things  index  for
       things that have a type of LightBulb.

          aws iot search-index \
              --index-name "AWS_Things" \
              --query-string "thingTypeName:LightBulb"

       Output:
