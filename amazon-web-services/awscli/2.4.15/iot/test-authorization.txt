TEST-AUTHORIZATION()                                      TEST-AUTHORIZATION()



NAME
       test-authorization -

DESCRIPTION
       Tests  if  a specified principal is authorized to perform an IoT action
       on a specified resource. Use this to test and debug  the  authorization
       behavior of devices that connect to the IoT device gateway.

       Requires permission to access the TestAuthorization action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            test-authorization
          [--principal <value>]
          [--cognito-identity-pool-id <value>]
          --auth-infos <value>
          [--client-id <value>]
          [--policy-names-to-add <value>]
          [--policy-names-to-skip <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --principal (string)
          The     principal.     Valid     principals    are    CertificateArn
          (arn:aws:iot:region :accountId :cert/certificateId ),  thingGroupArn
          (arn:aws:iot:region :accountId :thinggroup/groupName ) and CognitoId
          (region :id ).

       --cognito-identity-pool-id (string)
          The Cognito identity pool ID.

       --auth-infos (list)
          A list of authorization info objects. Simulating authorization  will
          create a response for each authInfo object in the list.

          (structure)
              A collection of authorization information.

              actionType -> (string)
                 The  type  of  action for which the principal is being autho-
                 rized.

              resources -> (list)
                 The resources for which the principal is being authorized  to
                 perform the specified action.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          actionType=string,resources=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "actionType": "PUBLISH"|"SUBSCRIBE"|"RECEIVE"|"CONNECT",
              "resources": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --client-id (string)
          The MQTT client ID.

       --policy-names-to-add (list)
          When  testing  custom authorization, the policies specified here are
          treated as if they are attached to the principal being authorized.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --policy-names-to-skip (list)
          When testing custom authorization, the policies specified  here  are
          treated  as  if  they are not attached to the principal being autho-
          rized.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       The following test-authorization example tests  the  AWS  IoT  policies
       associated with the specified principal.
