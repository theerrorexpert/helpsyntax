DESCRIPTION

       Requires permission to access the CancelJob action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            cancel-job
          --job-id <value>
          [--reason-code <value>]
          [--comment <value>]
          [--force | --no-force]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The  unique identifier you assigned to this job when it was created.

       --reason-code (string)
          (Optional)A reason code string that explains why the  job  was  can-
          celed.

       --comment (string)
          An optional comment string describing why the job was canceled.

       --force | --no-force (boolean)
          (Optional)  If  true  job  executions  with status "IN_PROGRESS" and
          "QUEUED" are canceled, otherwise only  job  executions  with  status
          "QUEUED" are canceled. The default is false .

          Canceling a job which is "IN_PROGRESS", will cause a device which is
          executing the job to be unable to update the job  execution  status.
          Use  caution  and  ensure  that each device executing a job which is
          canceled is able to recover to a valid state.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
