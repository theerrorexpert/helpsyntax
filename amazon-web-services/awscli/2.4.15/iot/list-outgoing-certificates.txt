LIST-OUTGOING-CERTIFICATES()                      LIST-OUTGOING-CERTIFICATES()



NAME
       list-outgoing-certificates -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists certificates that are being transferred but not yet accepted.

       Requires permission to access the ListOutgoingCertificates action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-outgoing-certificates is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: outgoingCertificates

SYNOPSIS
            list-outgoing-certificates
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--ascending-order | --no-ascending-order]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --ascending-order | --no-ascending-order (boolean)
          Specifies  the  order for results. If True, the results are returned
          in ascending order, based on the creation date.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list certificates being transferred to a different AWS account

       The following list-outgoing-certificates example lists all device  cer-
       tificates  that  are in the process of being transferred to a different
       AWS account using the transfer-certificate command.

          aws iot list-outgoing-certificates

       Output:

          {
              "outgoingCertificates": [
                  {
                      "certificateArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:030714055129:cert/488b6a7f2acdeb00a77384e63c4e40b18b1b3caaae57b7272ba44c45e3448142",
