LIST-AUDIT-SUPPRESSIONS()                            LIST-AUDIT-SUPPRESSIONS()



NAME
       list-audit-suppressions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists your Device Defender audit listings.

       Requires permission to access the ListAuditSuppressions action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-audit-suppressions  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: suppressions

SYNOPSIS

          [--check-name <value>]

OPTIONS
       --check-name (string)
          An audit check name. Checks must be enabled for your  account.  (Use
          DescribeAccountAuditConfiguration  to  see  the  list of all checks,
          including those that are enabled or use UpdateAccountAuditConfigura-
          tion to select which checks are enabled.)

       --resource-identifier (structure)
          Information that identifies the noncompliant resource.

          deviceCertificateId -> (string)
              The ID of the certificate attached to the resource.

          caCertificateId -> (string)
              The  ID of the CA certificate used to authorize the certificate.

          cognitoIdentityPoolId -> (string)
              The ID of the Amazon Cognito identity pool.

          clientId -> (string)
              The client ID.

          policyVersionIdentifier -> (structure)
              The version of the policy associated with the resource.

              policyName -> (string)
                 The name of the policy.

              policyVersionId -> (string)
                 The ID of the version  of  the  policy  associated  with  the
                 resource.

          account -> (string)
              The account with which the resource is associated.

          iamRoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the IAM role that has overly permissive actions.

          roleAliasArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the role alias that has overly permissive actions.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          deviceCertificateId=string,caCertificateId=string,cognitoIdentityPoolId=string,clientId=string,policyVersionIdentifier={policyName=string,policyVersionId=string},account=string,iamRoleArn=string,roleAliasArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "deviceCertificateId": "string",
            "caCertificateId": "string",
            "cognitoIdentityPoolId": "string",
            "clientId": "string",
            "policyVersionIdentifier": {
              "policyName": "string",
              "policyVersionId": "string"
            },
            "account": "string",
            "iamRoleArn": "string",
            "roleAliasArn": "string"
          }

       --ascending-order | --no-ascending-order (boolean)
          Determines  whether  suppressions  are  listed in ascending order by
          expiration date or  not.  If  parameter  isn't  provided,  ascendin-
          gOrder=true .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                          "deviceCertificateId": "c7691e<shortened>"
