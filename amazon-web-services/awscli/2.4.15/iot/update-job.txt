SYNOPSIS
            update-job
          --job-id <value>
          [--description <value>]
          [--presigned-url-config <value>]
          [--job-executions-rollout-config <value>]
          [--abort-config <value>]
          [--timeout-config <value>]
          [--namespace-id <value>]
          [--job-executions-retry-config <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The ID of the job to be updated.

       --description (string)
          A short text description of the job.

       --presigned-url-config (structure)
          Configuration information for pre-signed S3 URLs.

          roleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of an IAM role that grants grants permission to download
              files from the S3 bucket where the job data/updates are  stored.
              The  role  must  also  grant  permission for IoT to download the
              files.

          expiresInSec -> (long)
              How long (in seconds) pre-signed URLs are  valid.  Valid  values
              are  60  -  3600,  the default value is 3600 seconds. Pre-signed
              URLs are generated when Jobs receives an MQTT  request  for  the
              job document.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          roleArn=string,expiresInSec=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "roleArn": "string",
            "expiresInSec": long
          }

       --job-executions-rollout-config (structure)
          Allows you to create a staged rollout of the job.

          maximumPerMinute -> (integer)
              The  maximum number of things that will be notified of a pending
              job, per minute. This parameter allows you to  create  a  staged
              rollout.

          exponentialRate -> (structure)
              The  rate  of  increase for a job rollout. This parameter allows
              you to define an exponential rate for a job rollout.

              baseRatePerMinute -> (integer)
                 The minimum number of things that will be notified of a pend-
                 ing job, per minute at the start of job rollout. This parame-
                 ter allows you to define the initial rate of rollout.

              incrementFactor -> (double)
                 The exponential factor to increase the rate of rollout for  a
                 job.

                 Amazon  Web  Services IoT Core supports up to one digit after
                 the decimal (for example, 1.5, but not 1.55).

              rateIncreaseCriteria -> (structure)
                 The criteria to initiate the increase in rate of rollout  for
                 a job.

                 numberOfNotifiedThings -> (integer)
                     The  threshold  for  number  of notified things that will
                     initiate the increase in rate of rollout.

                 numberOfSucceededThings -> (integer)
                     The threshold for number of succeeded  things  that  will
                     initiate the increase in rate of rollout.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          maximumPerMinute=integer,exponentialRate={baseRatePerMinute=integer,incrementFactor=double,rateIncreaseCriteria={numberOfNotifiedThings=integer,numberOfSucceededThings=integer}}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "maximumPerMinute": integer,
            "exponentialRate": {
              "baseRatePerMinute": integer,
              "incrementFactor": double,
              "rateIncreaseCriteria": {
                "numberOfNotifiedThings": integer,
                "numberOfSucceededThings": integer
              }
            }
          }

       --abort-config (structure)
          Allows you to create criteria to abort a job.

          criteriaList -> (list)
              The  list  of  criteria that determine when and how to abort the
              job.

              (structure)
                 The criteria that determine when and how a  job  abort  takes
                 place.

                 failureType -> (string)
                     The  type  of  job execution failures that can initiate a
                     job abort.

                 action -> (string)
                     The type of job action to take to initiate the job abort.

                 thresholdPercentage -> (double)
                     The  minimum  percentage  of  job execution failures that
                     must occur to initiate the job abort.

                     Amazon Web Services IoT Core supports up  to  two  digits
                     after  the  decimal (for example, 10.9 and 10.99, but not
                     10.999).

                 minNumberOfExecutedThings -> (integer)
                     The minimum number of things which must receive job  exe-
                     cution notifications before the job can be aborted.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          criteriaList=[{failureType=string,action=string,thresholdPercentage=double,minNumberOfExecutedThings=integer},{failureType=string,action=string,thresholdPercentage=double,minNumberOfExecutedThings=integer}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "criteriaList": [
              {
                "failureType": "FAILED"|"REJECTED"|"TIMED_OUT"|"ALL",
                "action": "CANCEL",
                "thresholdPercentage": double,
                "minNumberOfExecutedThings": integer
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --timeout-config (structure)
          Specifies the amount of time each device has to finish its execution
          of the job. The timer is started when the job  execution  status  is
          set  to  IN_PROGRESS  .  If  the  job execution status is not set to
          another terminal state before the time expires, it will be automati-
          cally set to TIMED_OUT .

          inProgressTimeoutInMinutes -> (long)
              Specifies  the  amount  of  time, in minutes, this device has to
              finish execution of this job. The timeout interval can  be  any-
              where  between  1 minute and 7 days (1 to 10080 minutes). The in
              progress timer can't be updated and will apply to all job execu-
              tions  for  the  job.  Whenever  a  job execution remains in the
              IN_PROGRESS status for longer than this interval, the job execu-
              tion will fail and switch to the terminal TIMED_OUT status.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          inProgressTimeoutInMinutes=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "inProgressTimeoutInMinutes": long
          }

       --namespace-id (string)
          The namespace used to indicate that a job is a customer-managed job.

          When you specify a value for this parameter, Amazon Web Services IoT
          Core  sends jobs notifications to MQTT topics that contain the value
          in the following format.
              $aws/things/*THING_NAME*      /jobs/*JOB_ID*      /notify-names-
              pace-*NAMESPACE_ID* /

          NOTE:
              The namespaceId feature is in public preview.

       --job-executions-retry-config (structure)
          Allows you to create the criteria to retry a job.

          criteriaList -> (list)
              The  list  of  criteria  that  determines  how  many retries are
              allowed for each failure type for a job.

              (structure)
                 The criteria that determines how many retries are allowed for
                 each failure type for a job.

                 failureType -> (string)
                     The  type  of  job execution failures that can initiate a
                     job retry.

                 numberOfRetries -> (integer)
                     The number of retries allowed for a failure type for  the
                     job.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          criteriaList=[{failureType=string,numberOfRetries=integer},{failureType=string,numberOfRetries=integer}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "criteriaList": [
              {
                "failureType": "FAILED"|"TIMED_OUT"|"ALL",
                "numberOfRetries": integer
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.
