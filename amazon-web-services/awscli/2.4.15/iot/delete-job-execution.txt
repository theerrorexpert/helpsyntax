NAME
       delete-job-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a job execution.

       Requires permission to access the DeleteJobExecution action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-job-execution
          --job-id <value>
          --thing-name <value>
          --execution-number <value>
          [--force | --no-force]
          [--namespace-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the  job whose execution on a particular device will be
          deleted.

       --thing-name (string)
          The name of the thing whose job execution will be deleted.

       --execution-number (long)
          The ID of the job  execution  to  be  deleted.  The  executionNumber
          refers  to the execution of a particular job on a particular device.

          Note that once a job execution is deleted, the  executionNumber  may
          be reused by IoT, so be sure you get and use the correct value here.

       --force | --no-force (boolean)
          (Optional) When true, you  can  delete  a  job  execution  which  is
          "IN_PROGRESS".  Otherwise, you can only delete a job execution which
          is in a terminal state ("SUCCEEDED", "FAILED", "REJECTED", "REMOVED"
          or "CANCELED") or an exception will occur. The default is false.

          NOTE:
              Deleting  a job execution which is "IN_PROGRESS", will cause the
              device to be unable to access job information or update the  job
              execution status. Use caution and ensure that the device is able
              to recover to a valid state.

       --namespace-id (string)
          The namespace used to indicate that a job is a customer-managed job.

          When you specify a value for this parameter, Amazon Web Services IoT
          Core sends jobs notifications to MQTT topics that contain the  value
          in the following format.
              $aws/things/*THING_NAME*      /jobs/*JOB_ID*      /notify-names-
              pace-*NAMESPACE_ID* /

          NOTE:
              The namespaceId feature is in public preview.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a job execution

       The following delete-job-execution example deletes the job execution of
       the  specified  job  on a device. Use describe-job-execution to get the
       execution number.

          aws iot delete-job-execution
              --job-id "example-job-02"
              --thing-name "MyRaspberryPi"
              --execution-number 1

       This command produces no output.

       For more information, see Creating and Managing Jobs (CLI) in  the  AWS
       IoT Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
