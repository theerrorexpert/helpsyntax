CREATE-THING()                                                  CREATE-THING()



NAME
       create-thing -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  thing record in the registry. If this call is made multiple
       times using the same thing name and configuration, the call  will  suc-
       ceed.  If this call is made with the same thing name but different con-
       figuration a ResourceAlreadyExistsException is thrown.

       NOTE:
          This is a control plane operation. See Authorization for information
          about authorizing control plane actions.

       Requires permission to access the CreateThing action.

SYNOPSIS
            create-thing
          --thing-name <value>
          [--thing-type-name <value>]
          [--attribute-payload <value>]
          [--billing-group-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --thing-name (string)
          The name of the thing to create.

          You  can't  change  a  thing's name after you create it. To change a
          thing's name, you must create a new thing, give it the new name, and
          then delete the old thing.

       --thing-type-name (string)
          The name of the thing type associated with the new thing.

       --attribute-payload (structure)
          The  attribute  payload,  which  consists  of up to three name/value
          pairs in a JSON document. For example:
              {\"attributes\":{\"string1\":\"string2\"}}

          attributes -> (map)
              A JSON string containing up to three key-value pair in JSON for-
              mat. For example:
                 {\"attributes\":{\"string1\":\"string2\"}}

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          merge -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  the  list  of  attributes  provided  in  the
              AttributePayload is merged with the  attributes  stored  in  the
              registry, instead of overwriting them.

              To remove an attribute, call UpdateThing with an empty attribute
              value.

              NOTE:
                 The merge attribute is only valid when calling UpdateThing or
                 UpdateThingGroup .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attributes={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string},merge=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "attributes": {"string": "string"
              ...},
            "merge": true|false
          }

       --billing-group-name (string)
          The name of the billing group the thing will be added to.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To create a thing record in the registry

       The following create-thing example creates an entry for a device in the
       AWS IoT thing registry.

          aws iot create-thing \
              --thing-name SampleIoTThing

       Output:

          {
              "thingName": "SampleIoTThing",
              "thingArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2: 123456789012:thing/SampleIoTThing",
              "thingId": " EXAMPLE1-90ab-cdef-fedc-ba987EXAMPLE "
          }

       Example 2: To define a thing that is associated with a thing type

       The following create-thing example create a thing that has  the  speci-
       fied thing type and its attributes.

          aws iot create-thing \
              --thing-name "MyLightBulb" \
              --thing-type-name "LightBulb" \
              --attribute-payload "{"attributes": {"wattage":"75", "model":"123"}}"

       Output:

          {
              "thingName": "MyLightBulb",
              "thingArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:thing/MyLightBulb",
              "thingId": "40da2e73-c6af-406e-b415-15acae538797"
          }

       Thing Types in the AWS IoT Developers Guide.

OUTPUT
       thingName -> (string)
          The name of the new thing.

       thingArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the new thing.

       thingId -> (string)
          The thing ID.
