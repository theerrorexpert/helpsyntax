CREATE-CACHE-SECURITY-GROUP()                    CREATE-CACHE-SECURITY-GROUP()



NAME
       create-cache-security-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a new cache security group. Use a cache security group to con-
       trol access to one or more clusters.

       Cache security groups are only used when you  are  creating  a  cluster
       outside  of  an  Amazon  Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). If you are
       creating a cluster inside of a VPC, use a cache subnet  group  instead.
       For more information, see CreateCacheSubnetGroup .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-cache-security-group
          --cache-security-group-name <value>
          --description <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cache-security-group-name (string)
          A  name for the cache security group. This value is stored as a low-
          ercase string.

          Constraints: Must contain no more than 255 alphanumeric  characters.
          Cannot be the word "Default".

          Example: mysecuritygroup

       --description (string)
          A description for the cache security group.

       --tags (list)
          A  list  of  tags to be added to this resource. A tag is a key-value
          pair. A tag key must be accompanied by a tag value, although null is
          accepted.

          (structure)
              A tag that can be added to an ElastiCache cluster or replication
              group. Tags are composed of a Key/Value pair. You can  use  tags
              to categorize and track all your ElastiCache resources, with the
              exception of global replication group. When you  add  or  remove
              tags  on replication groups, those actions will be replicated to
              all nodes in the replication group. A tag with a null  Value  is
              permitted.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for the tag. May not be null.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag's value. May be null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
