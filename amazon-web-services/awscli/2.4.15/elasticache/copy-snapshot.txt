NAME
       copy-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Makes a copy of an existing snapshot.

       NOTE:
          This operation is valid for Redis only.

       WARNING:
          Users or groups that have permissions to use the CopySnapshot opera-
          tion can create their own Amazon S3 buckets and  copy  snapshots  to
          it.  To  control access to your snapshots, use an IAM policy to con-
          trol who has the ability to use the CopySnapshot operation. For more
          information about using IAM to control the use of ElastiCache opera-
          tions, see Exporting Snapshots and Authentication & Access Control .

       You could receive the following error messages.
          Error Messages

       o Error  Message: The S3 bucket %s is outside of the region.  Solution:
         Create an Amazon S3 bucket in the same region as your  snapshot.  For
         more information, see Step 1: Create an Amazon S3 Bucket in the Elas-
         tiCache User Guide.

       o Error Message: The S3 bucket %s does not exist.  Solution: Create  an
         Amazon S3 bucket in the same region as your snapshot. For more infor-
         mation, see Step 1: Create an Amazon S3  Bucket  in  the  ElastiCache
         User Guide.

       o Error  Message:  The  S3  bucket %s is not owned by the authenticated
         user.  Solution: Create an Amazon S3 bucket in  the  same  region  as
         your  snapshot. For more information, see Step 1: Create an Amazon S3
         Bucket in the ElastiCache User Guide.

       o Error Message: The authenticated user does not have  sufficient  per-
         missions  to  perform  the  desired activity.  Solution: Contact your
         system administrator to get the needed permissions.

       o Error Message: The S3 bucket %s already contains an object  with  key
         %s.  Solution: Give the TargetSnapshotName a new and unique value. If
         exporting a snapshot, you could alternatively create a new Amazon  S3
         bucket and use this same value for TargetSnapshotName .

       o Error  Message:  ElastiCache has not been granted READ permissions %s
         on the S3 Bucket.  Solution: Add List and  Read  permissions  on  the
         bucket. For more information, see Step 2: Grant ElastiCache Access to
         Your Amazon S3 Bucket in the ElastiCache User Guide.

       o Error Message: ElastiCache has not been granted WRITE permissions  %s
         on  the  S3  Bucket.   Solution: Add Upload/Delete permissions on the
         bucket. For more information, see Step 2: Grant ElastiCache Access to
         Your Amazon S3 Bucket in the ElastiCache User Guide.

       o Error  Message: ElastiCache has not been granted READ_ACP permissions
         %s on the S3 Bucket.  Solution: Add View Permissions on  the  bucket.
         For  more  information,  see Step 2: Grant ElastiCache Access to Your
         Amazon S3 Bucket in the ElastiCache User Guide.

SYNOPSIS
            copy-snapshot
          --source-snapshot-name <value>
          --target-snapshot-name <value>
          [--target-bucket <value>]
          [--kms-key-id <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-snapshot-name (string)
          The name of an existing snapshot from which to make a copy.

       --target-snapshot-name (string)
          A name for the snapshot copy. ElastiCache does not permit  overwrit-
          ing  a  snapshot, therefore this name must be unique within its con-
          text - ElastiCache or an Amazon S3 bucket if exporting.

       --target-bucket (string)
          The Amazon S3 bucket to which the snapshot is exported. This parame-
          ter is used only when exporting a snapshot for external access.

          When using this parameter to export a snapshot, be sure Amazon Elas-
          tiCache has the needed permissions  to  this  S3  bucket.  For  more
          information,  see Step 2: Grant ElastiCache Access to Your Amazon S3
          Bucket in the Amazon ElastiCache User Guide .

          For more information, see Exporting a Snapshot in the Amazon Elasti-
          Cache User Guide .

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The ID of the KMS key used to encrypt the target snapshot.

       --tags (list)
          A  list  of  tags to be added to this resource. A tag is a key-value
          pair. A tag key must be accompanied by a tag value, although null is
          accepted.

          (structure)
              A tag that can be added to an ElastiCache cluster or replication
              group. Tags are composed of a Key/Value pair. You can  use  tags
              to categorize and track all your ElastiCache resources, with the
              exception of global replication group. When you  add  or  remove
              tags  on replication groups, those actions will be replicated to
              all nodes in the replication group. A tag with a null  Value  is
              permitted.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for the tag. May not be null.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag's value. May be null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       Snapshot -> (structure)
          Represents a copy of an entire Redis cluster as of the time when the
          snapshot was taken.

          SnapshotName -> (string)
              The name of a snapshot. For an automatic snapshot, the  name  is
              system-generated.  For  a manual snapshot, this is the user-pro-
              vided name.

          ReplicationGroupId -> (string)
              The unique identifier of the source replication group.

          ReplicationGroupDescription -> (string)
              A description of the source replication group.

          CacheClusterId -> (string)
              The user-supplied identifier of the source cluster.

          SnapshotStatus -> (string)
              The status of the snapshot. Valid values: creating | available |
              restoring | copying | deleting .

          SnapshotSource -> (string)
              Indicates  whether  the  snapshot  is  from  an automatic backup
              (automated ) or was created manually (manual ).

          CacheNodeType -> (string)
              The name of the compute and memory capacity node  type  for  the
              source cluster.

              The following node types are supported by ElastiCache. Generally
              speaking, the current generation types provide more  memory  and
              computational power at lower cost when compared to their equiva-
              lent previous generation counterparts.

              cache subnet group for the source cluster.

          AutoMinorVersionUpgrade -> (boolean)
              If you are running Redis engine version 6.0 or later,  set  this
              parameter  to  yes  if you want to opt-in to the next auto minor
              version upgrade campaign. This parameter is disabled for  previ-
              ous versions.

          SnapshotRetentionLimit -> (integer)
              For  an automatic snapshot, the number of days for which Elasti-
              Cache retains the snapshot before deleting it.

              Limit for the source cluster when the snapshot was created. This
              field is otherwise ignored: Manual snapshots do not expire,  and
              can only be deleted using the DeleteSnapshot operation.
                 Important  If  the  value of SnapshotRetentionLimit is set to
                 zero (0), backups are turned off.

          SnapshotWindow -> (string)

              shots of the source cluster.

          NumNodeGroups -> (integer)
              The  number  of  node  groups  (shards)  in  this snapshot. When
              restoring from a snapshot, the number of node groups (shards) in
              the  snapshot  and in the restored replication group must be the
              same.

          AutomaticFailover -> (string)
              Indicates the status of automatic failover for the source  Redis
              replication group.

          NodeSnapshots -> (list)
              A list of the cache nodes in the source cluster.

              (structure)
                 Represents  an individual cache node in a snapshot of a clus-
