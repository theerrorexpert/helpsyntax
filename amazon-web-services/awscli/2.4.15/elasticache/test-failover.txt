TEST-FAILOVER()                                                TEST-FAILOVER()



NAME
       test-failover -

DESCRIPTION
       Represents  the  input of a TestFailover operation which test automatic
       failover on a specified node group (called shard in the console)  in  a
       replication group (called cluster in the console).

       This  API  is  designed for testing the behavior of your application in
       case of ElastiCache failover. It is not designed to be  an  operational
       tool  for initiating a failover to overcome a problem you may have with
       the cluster. Moreover, in certain conditions such as large-scale opera-
       tional events, Amazon may block this API.
          Note the following

       o A customer can use this operation to test automatic failover on up to
         5 shards (called node groups in the ElastiCache API and  Amazon  CLI)
         in any rolling 24-hour period.

       o If  calling  this  operation  on shards in different clusters (called
         replication groups in the API and CLI), the calls can be made concur-
         rently.

       o If  calling  this operation multiple times on different shards in the
         same Redis (cluster mode enabled) replication group, the  first  node
         replacement must complete before a subsequent call can be made.

       o To  determine  whether the node replacement is complete you can check
         Events using the Amazon ElastiCache console, the Amazon CLI,  or  the
         ElastiCache  API.  Look  for the following automatic failover related
         events, listed here in order of occurrance:

         o Replication group message: Test Failover API called for node  group
           <node-group-id>

         o Cache cluster message: Failover from primary node <primary-node-id>
           to replica node <node-id> completed

         o Replication  group  message:  Failover  from  primary  node   <pri-
           mary-node-id> to replica node <node-id> completed

         o Cache cluster message: Recovering cache nodes <node-id>

         o Cache cluster message: Finished recovery for cache nodes <node-id>

       For more information see:

          o Viewing ElastiCache Events in the ElastiCache User Guide

          o DescribeEvents in the ElastiCache API Reference

SYNOPSIS
            test-failover
          --replication-group-id <value>
          --node-group-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --replication-group-id (string)
          The name of the replication group (console: cluster) whose automatic
          failover is being tested by this operation.

       --node-group-id (string)
          The name of the node group (called shard in  the  console)  in  this
          replication  group  on which automatic failover is to be tested. You
          may test automatic failover on up to 5 node groups  in  any  rolling
          24-hour period.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To test failover of a node group

       The  following  test-failover  example  tests automatic failover on the
       specified node group (called a shard in the console) in  a  replication
       group (called a cluster in the console).

          aws elasticache test-failover /
              --replication-group-id "mycluster" /
              --node-group-id "0001"

          MemberClusters -> (list)
              The names of all the cache clusters that are part of this repli-
              cation group.

              (string)

          NodeGroups -> (list)
              A  list  of  node  groups  in  this replication group. For Redis
              (cluster mode disabled)  replication  groups,  this  is  a  sin-
              gle-element  list.  For Redis (cluster mode enabled) replication
              groups, the list contains an entry for each node group  (shard).

              (structure)
                 Represents  a  collection  of  cache  nodes  in a replication
                 group. One node in the node group is the  read/write  primary
                 node. All the other nodes are read-only Replica nodes.

                 NodeGroupId -> (string)
                     The identifier for the node group (shard). A Redis (clus-
                     ter mode disabled) replication group contains only 1 node
                     group;  therefore,  the  node  group  ID is 0001. A Redis
                     (cluster mode enabled) replication group contains 1 to 90
                     node  groups  numbered 0001 to 0090. Optionally, the user
                     can provide the id for a node group.

                 Status -> (string)
                     The current state of this replication group - creating  ,
                     available , modifying , deleting .

                 PrimaryEndpoint -> (structure)
                     The  endpoint  of  the  primary  node  in this node group
                     (shard).

                     Address -> (string)
                        The DNS hostname of the cache node.

                     Port -> (integer)
                        The port number that the cache engine is listening on.

                 ReaderEndpoint -> (structure)
                     The  endpoint  of  the  replica  nodes in this node group
                     (shard).

                     Address -> (string)
                        The DNS hostname of the cache node.

                     Port -> (integer)
                        The port number that the cache engine is listening on.

                 Slots -> (string)
