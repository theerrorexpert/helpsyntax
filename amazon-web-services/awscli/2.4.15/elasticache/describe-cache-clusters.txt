DESCRIBE-CACHE-CLUSTERS()                            DESCRIBE-CACHE-CLUSTERS()



NAME
       describe-cache-clusters -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about all provisioned clusters if no cluster iden-
       tifier is specified, or about a specific cache  cluster  if  a  cluster
       identifier is supplied.

       By default, abbreviated information about the clusters is returned. You
       can use the optional ShowCacheNodeInfo flag to retrieve detailed infor-
       mation  about  the  cache  nodes  associated  with  the clusters. These
       details include the DNS address and port for the cache node endpoint.

       If the cluster is in the creating state, only cluster-level information
       is displayed until all of the nodes are successfully provisioned.

       If the cluster is in the deleting state, only cluster-level information
       is displayed.

       If cache nodes are currently being added to the cluster, node  endpoint
       information  and  creation  time  for the additional nodes are not dis-
       played until they are completely provisioned. When the cluster state is
       available , the cluster is ready for use.

       If  cache  nodes  are currently being removed from the cluster, no end-
       point information for the removed nodes is displayed.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-cache-clusters is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: CacheClusters

SYNOPSIS
            describe-cache-clusters
          [--cache-cluster-id <value>]
          [--show-cache-node-info | --no-show-cache-node-info]
          [--show-cache-clusters-not-in-replication-groups | --no-show-cache-clusters-not-in-replication-groups]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cache-cluster-id (string)
          The  user-supplied  cluster  identifier. If this parameter is speci-
          fied, only information about that specific cluster is returned. This
          parameter isn't case sensitive.

       --show-cache-node-info | --no-show-cache-node-info (boolean)
          An  optional  flag  that can be included in the DescribeCacheCluster
          request to retrieve information about the individual cache nodes.

       --show-cache-clusters-not-in-replication-groups | --no-show-cache-clus-
       ters-not-in-replication-groups (boolean)
          An  optional  flag  that can be included in the DescribeCacheCluster
          request to show only nodes (API/CLI: clusters) that are not  members
          of  a replication group. In practice, this mean Memcached and single
          node Redis clusters.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          Provides an identifier to allow retrieval of paginated results.

       CacheClusters -> (list)
          A list of clusters. Each item in the list contains detailed informa-
          tion about one cluster.

          (structure)
              Contains all of the attributes of a specific cluster.

              CacheClusterId -> (string)
                 The user-supplied identifier of the cluster. This  identifier
                 is a unique key that identifies a cluster.

              ConfigurationEndpoint -> (structure)
                 Represents  a Memcached cluster endpoint which can be used by
                 an application to connect to any node  in  the  cluster.  The
                 configuration endpoint will always have .cfg in it.

                 Example: mem-3.9dvc4r.cfg.usw2.cache.amazonaws.com:11211

                 Address -> (string)

                 The name of the compute and memory capacity node type for the
                 cluster.

                 The following node types are supported by ElastiCache. Gener-
                 ally speaking, the current generation types provide more mem-
                 ory  and  computational  power at lower cost when compared to
                 their equivalent previous generation counterparts.

                     protocol-compliant caching software - either Memcached or
                     Redis.

                     The  following  node  types are supported by ElastiCache.
                     Generally speaking, the current generation types  provide
                     more  memory  and  computational power at lower cost when
                     compared to their equivalent previous generation counter-
                     parts.

                 The  number  of  days for which ElastiCache retains automatic
                 cluster snapshots before deleting them. For example,  if  you
                 set  SnapshotRetentionLimit  to  5, a snapshot that was taken
                 today is retained for 5 days before being deleted.

                 WARNING:
                     If the value of SnapshotRetentionLimit  is  set  to  zero

                 You cannot modify the value of TransitEncryptionEnabled after
                 the  cluster is created. To enable in-transit encryption on a
                 cluster you must set TransitEncryptionEnabled  to  true  when
                 you create a cluster.
                     Required:  Only  available  when  creating  a replication
                     group in an Amazon VPC using redis version 3.2.6 , 4.x or
