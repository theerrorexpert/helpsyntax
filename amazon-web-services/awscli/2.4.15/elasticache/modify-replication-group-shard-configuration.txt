MODIFY-REPLICATION-GROUP-SHARD-CMODIFY-REPLICATION-GROUP-SHARD-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       modify-replication-group-shard-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  a replication group's shards (node groups) by allowing you to
       add shards, remove shards, or rebalance the  keyspaces  among  existing
       shards.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-replication-group-shard-configuration
          --replication-group-id <value>
          --node-group-count <value>
          --apply-immediately | --no-apply-immediately
          [--resharding-configuration <value>]
          [--node-groups-to-remove <value>]
          [--node-groups-to-retain <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --replication-group-id (string)
          The  name  of  the Redis (cluster mode enabled) cluster (replication
          group) on which the shards are to be configured.

       --node-group-count (integer)
          The number of node groups (shards) that results from  the  modifica-
          tion of the shard configuration.

       --apply-immediately | --no-apply-immediately (boolean)
          Indicates that the shard reconfiguration process begins immediately.
          At present, the only permitted value for this parameter is true .

          Value: true

       --resharding-configuration (list)
          Specifies the preferred availability zones for each  node  group  in
          the cluster. If the value of NodeGroupCount is greater than the cur-
          rent number of node groups (shards), you can use this  parameter  to
          specify the preferred availability zones of the cluster's shards. If
          you omit this parameter ElastiCache selects availability  zones  for
          you.

          You  can  specify this parameter only if the value of NodeGroupCount
          is greater than the current number of node groups (shards).

          (structure)
              A list of PreferredAvailabilityZones objects that specifies  the
              configuration of a node group in the resharded cluster.

              NodeGroupId -> (string)
                 Either  the  ElastiCache  for  Redis supplied 4-digit id or a
                 user supplied id for the node group these configuration  val-
                 ues apply to.

              PreferredAvailabilityZones -> (list)
                 A  list of preferred availability zones for the nodes in this
                 cluster.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          NodeGroupId=string,PreferredAvailabilityZones=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "NodeGroupId": "string",
              "PreferredAvailabilityZones": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --node-groups-to-remove (list)
          If the value of NodeGroupCount is less than the  current  number  of
          node  groups  (shards), then either NodeGroupsToRemove or NodeGroup-
          sToRetain is required. NodeGroupsToRemove is a list of NodeGroupId s
          to remove from the cluster.

          ElastiCache  for Redis will attempt to remove all node groups listed
          by NodeGroupsToRemove from the cluster.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --node-groups-to-retain (list)
          If the value of NodeGroupCount is less than the  current  number  of
          node  groups  (shards), then either NodeGroupsToRemove or NodeGroup-
          sToRetain is required. NodeGroupsToRetain is a list of NodeGroupId s
          to retain in the cluster.

          ElastiCache  for Redis will attempt to remove all node groups except
          those listed by NodeGroupsToRetain from the cluster.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To modify a replication group shard configuration

       The  following  modify-replication-group-shard-configuration  decreases
       the node group count using the Redis engine.

          aws elasticache modify-replication-group-shard-configuration \
              --replication-group-id mycluster \
              --node-group-count 3 \
              --apply-immediately \
              --node-groups-to-remove 0002

              (string)

          NodeGroups -> (list)
              A list of node groups  in  this  replication  group.  For  Redis
              (cluster  mode  disabled)  replication  groups,  this  is a sin-
              gle-element list. For Redis (cluster mode  enabled)  replication
              groups,  the list contains an entry for each node group (shard).

              (structure)
                 Represents a collection  of  cache  nodes  in  a  replication
                 group.  One  node in the node group is the read/write primary

                     ter mode disabled) replication group contains only 1 node
                     group; therefore, the node group  ID  is  0001.  A  Redis
                     (cluster mode enabled) replication group contains 1 to 90
                     node groups numbered 0001 to 0090. Optionally,  the  user
                     can provide the id for a node group.

                     Address -> (string)
                        The DNS hostname of the cache node.

                            primary  or replica . This member is only applica-
                            ble for Redis (cluster mode disabled)  replication
                            groups.

              retained for 5 days before being deleted.

              WARNING:
                 If  the  value  of SnapshotRetentionLimit is set to zero (0),

              If  you do not specify this parameter, ElastiCache automatically
              chooses an appropriate time range.
