NAME
       decrease-replica-count -

DESCRIPTION
       Dynamically  decreases  the number of replicas in a Redis (cluster mode
       disabled) replication group or the number of replica nodes  in  one  or
       more node groups (shards) of a Redis (cluster mode enabled) replication
       group. This operation is performed with no cluster down time.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            decrease-replica-count
          --replication-group-id <value>
          [--new-replica-count <value>]
          [--replica-configuration <value>]
          [--replicas-to-remove <value>]
          --apply-immediately | --no-apply-immediately
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --replication-group-id (string)
          The id of the replication  group  from  which  you  want  to  remove
          replica nodes.

       --new-replica-count (integer)
          The  number of read replica nodes you want at the completion of this
          operation. For Redis (cluster  mode  disabled)  replication  groups,
          this  is  the  number of replica nodes in the replication group. For
          Redis (cluster mode enabled) replication groups, this is the  number
          of replica nodes in each of the replication group's node groups.

          The minimum number of replicas in a shard or replication group is:

          o Redis (cluster mode disabled)

            o If Multi-AZ is enabled: 1

            o If Multi-AZ is not enabled: 0

          o Redis  (cluster  mode  enabled): 0 (though you will not be able to
            failover to a replica if your primary node fails)

       --replica-configuration (list)
          A list of ConfigureShard objects that can be used to configure  each
          shard  in a Redis (cluster mode enabled) replication group. The Con-
          figureShard has three members: NewReplicaCount , NodeGroupId  ,  and
          PreferredAvailabilityZones .

          (structure)
              Node group (shard) configuration options when adding or removing
              replicas. Each node group (shard) configuration has the  follow-
              ing  members:  NodeGroupId, NewReplicaCount, and PreferredAvail-
              abilityZones.

              NodeGroupId -> (string)
                 The 4-digit id for the node group you  are  configuring.  For
                 Redis  (cluster  mode  disabled) replication groups, the node
                 group id is always  0001.  To  find  a  Redis  (cluster  mode
                 enabled)'s  node  group's (shard's) id, see Finding a Shard's
                 Id .

              NewReplicaCount -> (integer)
                 The number of replicas you want in this node group at the end
                 of  this  operation. The maximum value for NewReplicaCount is
                 5. The minimum value depends upon the type of Redis  replica-
                 tion group you are working with.

                 The  minimum  number  of  replicas  in a shard or replication
                 group is:

                 o Redis (cluster mode disabled)

                   o If Multi-AZ: 1

                   o If Multi-AZ: 0

                 o Redis (cluster mode enabled): 0 (though  you  will  not  be
                   able to failover to a replica if your primary node fails)

              PreferredAvailabilityZones -> (list)
                 A  list  of  PreferredAvailabilityZone  strings  that specify
                 which availability zones the replication group's nodes are to
                 be  in.  The nummber of PreferredAvailabilityZone values must
                 equal the value of NewReplicaCount plus 1 to account for  the
                 primary node. If this member of ReplicaConfiguration is omit-
                 ted, ElastiCache for Redis selects the availability zone  for
                 each of the replicas.

                 (string)

              PreferredOutpostArns -> (list)
                 The outpost ARNs in which the cache cluster is created.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          NodeGroupId=string,NewReplicaCount=integer,PreferredAvailabilityZones=string,string,PreferredOutpostArns=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "NodeGroupId": "string",
              "NewReplicaCount": integer,
              "PreferredAvailabilityZones": ["string", ...],
              "PreferredOutpostArns": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --replicas-to-remove (list)
          A  list of the node ids to remove from the replication group or node
          group (shard).

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --apply-immediately | --no-apply-immediately (boolean)
          If True , the number of  replica  nodes  is  decreased  immediately.
          ApplyImmediately=False is not currently supported.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To decrease replica count

       The  following decrease-replica-count example dynamically decreases the
       number of replics in a Redis (cluster mode disabled) replication  group
       or the number of replica nodes in one or more node groups (shards) of a
       Redis (cluster mode enabled) replication group. This operation is  per-
       formed with no cluster downtime.

          MemberClusters -> (list)
              The names of all the cache clusters that are part of this repli-
              cation group.

              (string)

          NodeGroups -> (list)
              A list of node groups  in  this  replication  group.  For  Redis
              (cluster  mode  disabled)  replication  groups,  this  is a sin-
              gle-element list. For Redis (cluster mode  enabled)  replication
              groups,  the list contains an entry for each node group (shard).

              (structure)
                 Represents a collection  of  cache  nodes  in  a  replication
                 group.  One  node in the node group is the read/write primary
                 node. All the other nodes are read-only Replica nodes.

                 NodeGroupId -> (string)
                     The identifier for the node group (shard). A Redis (clus-
                     ter mode disabled) replication group contains only 1 node
                     group; therefore, the node group  ID  is  0001.  A  Redis
                     (cluster mode enabled) replication group contains 1 to 90
                     node groups numbered 0001 to 0090. Optionally,  the  user
                     can provide the id for a node group.

                 Status -> (string)
