NAME
       create-user-group -

DESCRIPTION
       For  Redis  engine version 6.0 onwards: Creates a Redis user group. For
       more information, see Using Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-user-group
          --user-group-id <value>
          --engine <value>
          [--user-ids <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-group-id (string)
          The ID of the user group.

       --engine (string)
          The current supported value is Redis.

       --user-ids (list)
          The list of user IDs that belong to the user group.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags to be added to this resource. A tag  is  a  key-value
          pair. A tag key must be accompanied by a tag value, although null is
          accepted.

          (structure)
              A tag that can be added to an ElastiCache cluster or replication
              group.  Tags  are composed of a Key/Value pair. You can use tags
              to categorize and track all your ElastiCache resources, with the
              exception  of  global  replication group. When you add or remove
              tags on replication groups, those actions will be replicated  to
              all  nodes  in the replication group. A tag with a null Value is
              permitted.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for the tag. May not be null.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag's value. May be null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a user group

       The following create-user-group example creates a new user group.

          aws elasticache create-user-group \
              --user-group-id myusergroup \
              --engine redis \
              --user-ids default

       Output:

          {
              "UserGroupId": "myusergroup",
              "Status": "creating",
              "Engine": "redis",
              "UserIds": [
                  "default"
              ],
              "ReplicationGroups": [],
              "ARN": "arn:aws:elasticache:us-west-2:xxxxxxxxxx52:usergroup:myusergroup"
          }

       Control (RBAC) in the Elasticache User Guide.
