NAME
       create-global-replication-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Global  Datastore  for  Redis  offers fully managed, fast, reliable and
       secure cross-region replication. Using Global Datastore for Redis,  you
       can create cross-region read replica clusters for ElastiCache for Redis
       to enable low-latency reads and disaster recovery across  regions.  For
       more information, see Replication Across Regions Using Global Datastore
       .

       o The GlobalReplicationGroupIdSuffix is the name of the  Global  datas-
         tore.

       o The  PrimaryReplicationGroupId  represents  the  name  of the primary
         cluster that accepts writes and will replicate updates  to  the  sec-
         ondary cluster.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-global-replication-group
          --global-replication-group-id-suffix <value>
          [--global-replication-group-description <value>]
          --primary-replication-group-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-replication-group-id-suffix (string)
          The  suffix name of a Global datastore. Amazon ElastiCache automati-
          cally applies a prefix to the Global datastore ID when  it  is  cre-
          ated.  Each Amazon Region has its own prefix. For instance, a Global
          datastore ID created in the US-West-1 region will begin with "dsdfu"
          along  with  the  suffix name you provide. The suffix, combined with
          the auto-generated prefix, guarantees uniqueness of the Global data-
          store name across multiple regions.

          For a full list of Amazon Regions and their respective Global datas-
          tore iD prefixes, see Using the Amazon CLI with Global datastores  .

       --global-replication-group-description (string)
          Provides details of the Global datastore

       --primary-replication-group-id (string)
          The  name of the primary cluster that accepts writes and will repli-
          cate updates to the secondary cluster.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a global replication group

       The following create-global-replication-group  example  creates  a  new
       global replication group.

          aws elasticache create-global-replication-group \
              --global-replication-group-id-suffix my-global-replication-group \
              --primary-replication-group-id my-primary-cluster

          cally replicates updates to the secondary cluster.
