DESCRIBE-REPLICATION-GROUPS()                    DESCRIBE-REPLICATION-GROUPS()



NAME
       describe-replication-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about a particular replication group. If no identi-
       fier is specified, DescribeReplicationGroups returns information  about
       all replication groups.

       NOTE:
          This operation is valid for Redis only.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-replication-groups  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: ReplicationGroups

SYNOPSIS
            describe-replication-groups
          [--replication-group-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --replication-group-id (string)
          The identifier for the  replication  group  to  be  described.  This
          parameter is not case sensitive.

          If you do not specify this parameter, information about all replica-
          tion groups is returned.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       The  following describe-replication-groups example returns the replica-
       tion groups.

                 The names of all the cache clusters that  are  part  of  this
                 replication group.

                 (string)

              NodeGroups -> (list)
                 A  list  of  node groups in this replication group. For Redis
                 (cluster mode disabled) replication groups, this  is  a  sin-
                 gle-element  list.  For Redis (cluster mode enabled) replica-
                 tion groups, the list contains an entry for each  node  group
                 (shard).

                 (structure)
                     Represents  a  collection of cache nodes in a replication
                     group. One node in the node group is the read/write  pri-
                     mary  node.  All  the  other  nodes are read-only Replica
                     nodes.

                     NodeGroupId -> (string)
                        The identifier for the node  group  (shard).  A  Redis
                        (cluster  mode  disabled)  replication  group contains
                        only 1 node group; therefore, the  node  group  ID  is
                        0001. A Redis (cluster mode enabled) replication group
                        contains 1 to 90 node groups numbered  0001  to  0090.

                 cluster  snapshots  before deleting them. For example, if you
                 set SnapshotRetentionLimit to 5, a snapshot  that  was  taken
                 today is retained for 5 days before being deleted.

                 WARNING:
                     If  the  value  of  SnapshotRetentionLimit is set to zero

                 If  you  do not specify this parameter, ElastiCache automati-
                 cally chooses an appropriate time range.

                 NOTE:
