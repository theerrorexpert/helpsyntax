NAME
       decrease-node-groups-in-global-replication-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Decreases the number of node groups in a Global datastore

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            decrease-node-groups-in-global-replication-group
          --global-replication-group-id <value>
          --node-group-count <value>
          [--global-node-groups-to-remove <value>]
          [--global-node-groups-to-retain <value>]
          --apply-immediately | --no-apply-immediately
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-replication-group-id (string)
          The name of the Global datastore

       --node-group-count (integer)
          The  number  of node groups (shards) that results from the modifica-
          tion of the shard configuration

       --global-node-groups-to-remove (list)
          If the value of NodeGroupCount is less than the  current  number  of
          node  groups  (shards), then either NodeGroupsToRemove or NodeGroup-
          sToRetain is required. GlobalNodeGroupsToRemove is a list  of  Node-
          GroupIds  to  remove  from  the  cluster. ElastiCache for Redis will
          attempt to remove all node groups listed by GlobalNodeGroupsToRemove
          from the cluster.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --global-node-groups-to-retain (list)
          If  the  value  of NodeGroupCount is less than the current number of
          node groups (shards), then either NodeGroupsToRemove  or  NodeGroup-
          sToRetain  is  required. GlobalNodeGroupsToRetain is a list of Node-
          GroupIds to retain from the  cluster.  ElastiCache  for  Redis  will
          attempt to retain all node groups listed by GlobalNodeGroupsToRetain
          from the cluster.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --apply-immediately | --no-apply-immediately (boolean)
          Indicates that the shard reconfiguration process begins immediately.
          At present, the only permitted value for this parameter is true.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GlobalReplicationGroup -> (structure)

          cally replicates updates to the secondary cluster.

          o The GlobalReplicationGroupIdSuffix  represents  the  name  of  the

            cluster.

                 Required: Only available when creating a replication group in
