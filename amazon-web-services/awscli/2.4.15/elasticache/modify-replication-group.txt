OPTIONS
       --replication-group-id (string)
          The identifier of the replication group to modify.

       --replication-group-description (string)
          A description for the replication group. Maximum length is 255 char-
          acters.

       --primary-cluster-id (string)
          For replication groups with a single primary, if this  parameter  is
          specified,  ElastiCache promotes the specified cluster in the speci-
          fied replication group to the primary role. The nodes of  all  other
          clusters in the replication group are read replicas.

       --snapshotting-cluster-id (string)
          The  cluster  ID  that  is used as the daily snapshot source for the
          replication group. This parameter cannot be set for  Redis  (cluster
          mode enabled) replication groups.

       --automatic-failover-enabled      |     --no-automatic-failover-enabled
       (boolean)
          Determines whether a  read  replica  is  automatically  promoted  to
          read/write primary if the existing primary encounters a failure.

          Valid values: true | false

       --multi-az-enabled | --no-multi-az-enabled (boolean)
          A flag to indicate MultiAZ is enabled.

       --node-group-id (string)
          Deprecated. This parameter is not used.

       --cache-security-group-names (list)
          A  list  of cache security group names to authorize for the clusters
          in this replication group. This change is asynchronously applied  as
          soon as possible.

          This  parameter  can  be used only with replication group containing
          clusters running outside of an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud  (Amazon
          VPC).

          Constraints:  Must contain no more than 255 alphanumeric characters.
          Must not be Default .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --security-group-ids (list)
          Specifies the VPC Security Groups associated with  the  clusters  in
          the replication group.

          This  parameter  can  be used only with replication group containing
          clusters running in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --preferred-maintenance-window (string)
          Specifies the weekly time range  during  which  maintenance  on  the
          cluster  is  performed.  It  is  specified  as a range in the format
          ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi (24H Clock  UTC).  The  minimum  maintenance
          window is a 60 minute period.

          Valid values for ddd are:

          o sun

          o mon

          o tue

          o wed

          o thu

          o fri

          o sat

          Example: sun:23:00-mon:01:30

       --notification-topic-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of the Amazon SNS topic to which
          notifications are sent.

          NOTE:
              The Amazon SNS topic owner must be same as the replication group
              owner.

       --cache-parameter-group-name (string)
          The  name  of the cache parameter group to apply to all of the clus-
          ters in  this  replication  group.  This  change  is  asynchronously
          applied as soon as possible for parameters when the ApplyImmediately
          parameter is specified as true for this request.

       --notification-topic-status (string)
          The status of the Amazon SNS notification topic for the  replication
          group. Notifications are sent only if the status is active .

          Valid values: active | inactive

       --apply-immediately | --no-apply-immediately (boolean)
          If  true  ,  this parameter causes the modifications in this request
          and any pending modifications to be applied, asynchronously  and  as
          soon  as possible, regardless of the PreferredMaintenanceWindow set-
          ting for the replication group.

          If false , changes to the nodes in the replication group are applied
          on  the  next maintenance reboot, or the next failure reboot, which-
          ever occurs first.

          Valid values: true | false

          Default: false

       --engine-version (string)
          The upgraded version of the cache engine to be run on  the  clusters
          in the replication group.
              Important:  You  can  upgrade  to  a  newer  engine version (see
              Selecting a Cache Engine and Version ), but you cannot downgrade
              to  an  earlier  engine  version.  If you want to use an earlier
              engine version, you must delete the existing  replication  group
              and create it anew with the earlier engine version.

       --auto-minor-version-upgrade      |     --no-auto-minor-version-upgrade
       (boolean)
          If you are running Redis engine  version  6.0  or  later,  set  this
          parameter  to  yes if you want to opt-in to the next auto minor ver-
          sion upgrade campaign. This parameter is disabled for previous  ver-
          sions.

       --snapshot-retention-limit (integer)
          The  number  of  days  for  which ElastiCache retains automatic node
          group (shard) snapshots before deleting them. For  example,  if  you
          set  SnapshotRetentionLimit to 5, a snapshot that was taken today is
          retained for 5 days before being deleted.
              Important If the value of SnapshotRetentionLimit is set to  zero
              (0), backups are turned off.

       --snapshot-window (string)
          The daily time range (in UTC) during which ElastiCache begins taking
          a daily snapshot of the node group (shard)  specified  by  Snapshot-
          tingClusterId .

          Example: 05:00-09:00

          If  you  do  not  specify  this parameter, ElastiCache automatically
          chooses an appropriate time range.

       --cache-node-type (string)
          A valid cache node type that you  want  to  scale  this  replication
          group to.

       --auth-token (string)
          Reserved parameter. The password used to access a password protected
          server.   This   parameter    must    be    specified    with    the
          auth-token-update-strategy parameter. Password constraints:

          o Must be only printable ASCII characters

          o Must  be at least 16 characters and no more than 128 characters in
            length

          o Cannot contain any of the following characters: '/', '"', or  '@',
            '%'

          For more information, see AUTH password at AUTH .

       --auth-token-update-strategy (string)
          Specifies the strategy to use to update the AUTH token. This parame-
          ter must be specified with the auth-token parameter.  Possible  val-
          ues:

          o Rotate

          o Set

          For more information, see Authenticating Users with Redis AUTH

          Possible values:

              "DestinationType": "cloudwatch-logs"|"kinesis-firehose",
              "DestinationDetails": {
                "CloudWatchLogsDetails": {
                  "LogGroup": "string"
                },
                "KinesisFirehoseDetails": {
                  "DeliveryStream": "string"
                }
              },

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
