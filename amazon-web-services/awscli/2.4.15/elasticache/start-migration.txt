NAME
       start-migration -

DESCRIPTION
       Start the migration of data.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-migration
          --replication-group-id <value>
          --customer-node-endpoint-list <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --replication-group-id (string)
          The ID of the replication group to which data should be migrated.

       --customer-node-endpoint-list (list)
          List  of  endpoints  from  which  data should be migrated. For Redis
          (cluster mode disabled), list should have only one element.

          (structure)
              The endpoint from which data should be migrated.

              Address -> (string)
                 The address of the node endpoint

              Port -> (integer)
                 The port of the node endpoint

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Address=string,Port=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Address": "string",
              "Port": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To start a migration

       The following start-migratio migrates your data from self-hosted  Redis
       on Amazon EC2 to Amazon ElastiCache, using the Redis engine.

          aws elasticache start-migration \
             --replication-group-id test \
             --customer-node-endpoint-list "Address='test.g2xbih.ng.0001.usw2.cache.amazonaws.com',Port=6379"

              (string)

          NodeGroups -> (list)
              A list of node groups  in  this  replication  group.  For  Redis
              (cluster  mode  disabled)  replication  groups,  this  is a sin-
              gle-element list. For Redis (cluster mode  enabled)  replication
              groups,  the list contains an entry for each node group (shard).

                     ter mode disabled) replication group contains only 1 node
                     group; therefore, the node group  ID  is  0001.  A  Redis
                     (cluster mode enabled) replication group contains 1 to 90
                     node groups numbered 0001 to 0090. Optionally,  the  user
                     can provide the id for a node group.

                 Status -> (string)
                     The  current state of this replication group - creating ,
                     available , modifying , deleting .

                 PrimaryEndpoint -> (structure)
                     The endpoint of the  primary  node  in  this  node  group
                     (shard).

                     The endpoint of the replica  nodes  in  this  node  group
                     (shard).

                     Address -> (string)
                        The DNS hostname of the cache node.

                     Port -> (integer)
                        The port number that the cache engine is listening on.

                        ReadEndpoint -> (structure)
                            The  information  required  for client programs to
                            connect to a node for read  operations.  The  read
                            endpoint is only applicable on Redis (cluster mode
                            disabled) clusters.

                            Address -> (string)

                            primary  or replica . This member is only applica-
                            ble for Redis (cluster mode disabled)  replication
                            groups.

              ter  snapshots  before  deleting  them.  For example, if you set
              SnapshotRetentionLimit to 5, a snapshot that was taken today  is
              retained for 5 days before being deleted.

              WARNING:
                 If  the  value  of SnapshotRetentionLimit is set to zero (0),
                 backups are turned off.

          SnapshotWindow -> (string)
              The daily time range (in UTC) during  which  ElastiCache  begins
              taking a daily snapshot of your node group (shard).

              Example: 05:00-09:00

              If  you do not specify this parameter, ElastiCache automatically
              chooses an appropriate time range.

              NOTE:
                 This parameter is only valid if the Engine parameter is redis
                 .

          ClusterEnabled -> (boolean)
              A flag indicating whether or not this replication group is clus-
              ter enabled; i.e., whether its data can  be  partitioned  across
              multiple shards (API/CLI: node groups).

          TransitEncryptionEnabled -> (boolean)
              A flag that enables in-transit encryption when set to true .

              You  cannot  modify  the value of TransitEncryptionEnabled after
              the cluster is created. To enable  in-transit  encryption  on  a
              cluster  you  must set TransitEncryptionEnabled to true when you
              create a cluster.
                 Required: Only available when creating a replication group in
                 an Amazon VPC using redis version 3.2.6 , 4.x or later.

              Default: false

          AtRestEncryptionEnabled -> (boolean)
              A flag that enables encryption at-rest when set to true .

              You cannot modify the value of AtRestEncryptionEnabled after the
              cluster is created. To enable encryption at-rest  on  a  cluster
              you  must  set AtRestEncryptionEnabled to true when you create a
              cluster.
                 Required: Only available when creating a replication group in
