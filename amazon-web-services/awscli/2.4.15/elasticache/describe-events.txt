DESCRIBE-EVENTS()                                            DESCRIBE-EVENTS()



NAME
       describe-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  events  related  to clusters, cache security groups, and cache
       parameter groups. You can obtain events specific to a particular  clus-
       ter,  cache  security  group, or cache parameter group by providing the
       name as a parameter.

       By default,  only  the  events  occurring  within  the  last  hour  are
       returned;  however,  you can retrieve up to 14 days' worth of events if
       necessary.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-events is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Events

SYNOPSIS
            describe-events
          [--source-identifier <value>]
          [--source-type <value>]
          [--start-time <value>]
          [--end-time <value>]
          [--duration <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the event source for which events are returned. If
          not specified, all sources are included in the response.

       --source-type (string)
          The event source to retrieve events for. If no value  is  specified,
          all events are returned.

          Possible values:

          o cache-cluster

          o cache-parameter-group

          o cache-security-group

          o cache-subnet-group

          o replication-group

          o user

          o user-group

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The beginning of the time interval to retrieve events for, specified
          in ISO 8601 format.
              Example: 2017-03-30T07:03:49.555Z

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end of the time interval for which to retrieve events, specified
          in ISO 8601 format.
              Example: 2017-03-30T07:03:49.555Z

       --duration (integer)
          The number of minutes worth of events to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe events of a replication group

       The following describe-events example returns a list of  events  for  a
       replication group.

          aws elasticache describe-events \
              --source-identifier test-cluster \
              --source-type replication-group

       Output:

          {
              "Events": [
                  {
                      "SourceIdentifier": "test-cluster",
                      "SourceType": "replication-group",
                      "Message": "Automatic failover has been turned on for replication group test-cluster",
                      "Date": "2020-03-18T23:51:34.457Z"
                  },
                  {
                      "SourceIdentifier": "test-cluster",
                      "SourceType": "replication-group",
                      "Message": "Replication group test-cluster created",
                      "Date": "2020-03-18T23:50:31.378Z"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Guide.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          Provides an identifier to allow retrieval of paginated results.

       Events -> (list)
          A list of events. Each element in the list contains detailed  infor-
          mation about one event.

          (structure)
              Represents  a  single occurrence of something interesting within
              the system. Some examples of  events  are  creating  a  cluster,
              adding or removing a cache node, or rebooting a node.

              SourceIdentifier -> (string)
                 The  identifier  for the source of the event. For example, if
                 the event occurred at the cluster level, the identifier would
                 be the name of the cluster.

              SourceType -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  origin of this event - a cluster, a parameter
                 group, a security group, etc.

              Message -> (string)
                 The text of the event.

              Date -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the event occurred.
