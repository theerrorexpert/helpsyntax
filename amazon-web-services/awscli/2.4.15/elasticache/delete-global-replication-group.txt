DELETE-GLOBAL-REPLICATION-GROUP()            DELETE-GLOBAL-REPLICATION-GROUP()



NAME
       delete-global-replication-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Deleting a Global datastore is a two-step process:

       o First,  you  must   DisassociateGlobalReplicationGroup  to remove the
         secondary clusters in the Global datastore.

       o Once the Global datastore contains only the primary cluster, you  can
         use  the DeleteGlobalReplicationGroup API to delete the Global datas-
         tore while retainining the primary cluster using  RetainPrimaryRepli-
         cationGroup=true .

       Since  the  Global Datastore has only a primary cluster, you can delete
       the Global Datastore while retaining the primary by setting  RetainPri-
       maryReplicationGroup=true  .  The primary cluster is never deleted when
       deleting a Global Datastore. It can only be deleted when it  no  longer
       is associated with any Global Datastore.

       When  you  receive  a  successful  response from this operation, Amazon
       ElastiCache immediately begins deleting  the  selected  resources;  you
       cannot cancel or revert this operation.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-global-replication-group
          --global-replication-group-id <value>
          --retain-primary-replication-group | --no-retain-primary-replication-group
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-replication-group-id (string)
          The name of the Global datastore

       --retain-primary-replication-group    |    --no-retain-primary-replica-
       tion-group (boolean)
          The primary replication group is retained as a  standalone  replica-
          tion group.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a global replication group

       The  following  delete-global-replication-group  example  deletes a new
       global replication group.

          aws elasticache delete-global-replication-group \
              --global-replication-group-id my-global-replication-group \
              --retain-primary-replication-group

       Output:

          {
              "GlobalReplicationGroup": {
                  "GlobalReplicationGroupId": "sgaui-my-grg",
                  "GlobalReplicationGroupDescription": "my-grg",
                  "Status": "deleting",
                  "CacheNodeType": "cache.r5.large",
                  "Engine": "redis",
                  "EngineVersion": "5.0.6",

                      {
                          "ReplicationGroupId": "my-cluster-grg",
                          "ReplicationGroupRegion": "us-west-2",
                          "Role": "PRIMARY",

                          "Status": "associated"
                      }
                  ],
                  "ClusterEnabled": false,
                  "AuthTokenEnabled": false,
                  "TransitEncryptionEnabled": false,
                  "AtRestEncryptionEnabled": false
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       GlobalReplicationGroup -> (structure)
          Consists  of a primary cluster that accepts writes and an associated
          secondary cluster that resides in a  different  Amazon  region.  The
          secondary  cluster accepts only reads. The primary cluster automati-
          cally replicates updates to the secondary cluster.

          o The GlobalReplicationGroupIdSuffix  represents  the  name  of  the
            Global  datastore,  which is what you use to associate a secondary
            cluster.

              you must set TransitEncryptionEnabled to true when you create  a
              cluster.
                 Required: Only available when creating a replication group in
