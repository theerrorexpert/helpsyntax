CLOUDWATCH()                                                      CLOUDWATCH()



NAME
       cloudwatch -

DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  CloudWatch  monitors  your Amazon Web Services (Amazon Web Ser-
       vices) resources and the applications you run on Amazon Web Services in
       real  time.  You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which
       are the variables you want to measure for your resources  and  applica-
       tions.

       CloudWatch  alarms  send  notifications  or  automatically  change  the
       resources you are monitoring based on rules that you define. For  exam-
       ple,  you  can  monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your
       Amazon EC2 instances. Then, use this  data  to  determine  whether  you
       should  launch  additional  instances to handle increased load. You can
       also use this data to stop under-used instances to save money.

       In addition to monitoring the built-in metrics that  come  with  Amazon
       Web Services, you can monitor your own custom metrics. With CloudWatch,
       you gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization,  application
       performance, and operational health.
