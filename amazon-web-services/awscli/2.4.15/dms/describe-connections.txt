DESCRIBE-CONNECTIONS()                                  DESCRIBE-CONNECTIONS()



NAME
       describe-connections -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the status of the connections that have been made between the
       replication instance and an endpoint. Connections are created when  you
       test an endpoint.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-connections  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Connections

SYNOPSIS
            describe-connections
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          The filters applied to the connection.

          Valid filter names: endpoint-arn | replication-instance-arn

          (structure)
              Identifies the name and value of a filter object. This filter is
              used  to  limit  the  number  and  type  of DMS objects that are
              returned for a particular Describe* call or  similar  operation.
              Filters are used as an optional parameter for certain API opera-
              tions.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter as specified for a Describe* or  simi-
                 lar operation.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  value, which can specify one or more values used
                 to narrow the returned results.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe connections

       The  following  describe-connections example lists the connections that
       you have tested between a replication instance and an endpoint.

          aws dms describe-connections

       Output:

          {
              "Connections": [
                  {
                      "Status": "successful",
                      "ReplicationInstanceIdentifier": "test",

                  }

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter is specified, the response includes  only  records  beyond
          the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .

       Connections -> (list)
          A description of the connections.

          (structure)
              Status  of  the connection between an endpoint and a replication
              instance, including Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)  and  the  last
              error message issued.

              ReplicationInstanceArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the replication instance.

              EndpointArn -> (string)
                 The ARN string that uniquely identifies the endpoint.

              Status -> (string)
                 The  connection  status. This parameter can return one of the
                 following values:

                 o "successful"

                 o "testing"

                 o "failed"

                 o "deleting"

              LastFailureMessage -> (string)
                 The error message when the connection last failed.

              EndpointIdentifier -> (string)
                 The identifier of the endpoint. Identifiers must begin with a
                 letter  and  must  contain  only  ASCII  letters, digits, and
                 hyphens. They can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecu-
                 tive hyphens.

              ReplicationInstanceIdentifier -> (string)
                 The replication instance identifier. This parameter is stored
                 as a lowercase string.
