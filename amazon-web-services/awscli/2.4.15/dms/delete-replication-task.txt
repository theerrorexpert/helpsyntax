DELETE-REPLICATION-TASK()                            DELETE-REPLICATION-TASK()



NAME
       delete-replication-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the specified replication task.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-replication-task
          --replication-task-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --replication-task-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the  replication  task to be
          deleted.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              NOTE:
                 `                           StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun.html`__
                 is an improved premigration task assessment operation. The  `
                 StartReplicationTaskAssessment
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTaskAssessment.html`__
                 operation  assesses  data type compatibility only between the
                 source and target database of a given migration task. In con-
                 trast,           `          StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun.html`__
                 enables you to specify a variety of premigration task assess-
                 ments in addition to data type compatibility.  These  assess-
                 ments  include  ones  for the validity of primary key defini-
                 tions and likely issues with database migration  performance,
                 among others.

          LastFailureMessage -> (string)
              The  last  error (failure) message generated for the replication
              task.

          StopReason -> (string)
              The reason the  replication  task  was  stopped.  This  response
              parameter can return one of the following values:

              o "STOP_REASON_FULL_LOAD_COMPLETED"   Full-load  migration  com-
                pleted.

              o "STOP_REASON_CACHED_CHANGES_APPLIED"   Change   data   capture
                (CDC) load completed.

              o "STOP_REASON_CACHED_CHANGES_NOT_APPLIED"   In  a full-load and
                CDC migration, the  full  load  stopped  as  specified  before
                starting the CDC migration.

              o "STOP_REASON_SERVER_TIME"  The migration stopped at the speci-
                fied server time.

          ReplicationTaskCreationDate -> (timestamp)
              The date the replication task was created.

          ReplicationTaskStartDate -> (timestamp)
              The date the replication task is scheduled to start.

          CdcStartPosition -> (string)
              Indicates when you want a change data capture (CDC) operation to
              start.  Use  either  CdcStartPosition or CdcStartTime to specify
              when you want the CDC operation to start. Specifying both values
              results in an error.

              The value can be in date, checkpoint, or LSN/SCN format.

              Date Example: --cdc-start-position 2018-03-08T12:12:12

              Checkpoint       Example:      --cdc-start-position      "check-
              point:V1#27#mysql-bin-changelog.157832:1975:-1:2002:677883278264080:mysql-bin-changelog.157832:1876#0#0#*#0#93"

              LSN Example: --cdc-start-position mysql-bin-changelog.000024:373

          CdcStopPosition -> (string)
              Indicates when you want a change data capture (CDC) operation to
              stop. The value can be either server time or commit time.

              Server         time         example:         --cdc-stop-position
              server_time:2018-02-09T12:12:12

          RecoveryCheckpoint -> (string)
              Indicates the last checkpoint that occurred during a change data
              capture (CDC) operation. You can provide this value to the  Cdc-
              StartPosition  parameter to start a CDC operation that begins at
              that checkpoint.

                 start or a target reload.

              StartDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date the replication task was started either with a fresh

              FullLoadFinishDate -> (timestamp)

          TaskData -> (string)
              Supplemental information that the task requires to  migrate  the
              data  for certain source and target endpoints. For more informa-
              tion, see Specifying Supplemental Data for Task Settings in  the
              Database Migration Service User Guide.

          TargetReplicationInstanceArn -> (string)
              The  ARN of the replication instance to which this task is moved
