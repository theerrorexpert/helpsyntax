NAME
       delete-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the specified certificate.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-certificate
          --certificate-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the certificate.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Certificate -> (structure)

              and hyphens. They can't end with a hyphen or contain two consec-
              utive hyphens.

          CertificateCreationDate -> (timestamp)
              The date that the certificate was created.

          CertificatePem -> (string)
              The contents of a .pem file, which contains  an  X.509  certifi-
              cate.

          CertificateWallet -> (blob)
              The  location  of  an imported Oracle Wallet certificate for use
              with              SSL.              Example:               file-

          ValidToDate -> (timestamp)
              The final date that the certificate is valid.

          SigningAlgorithm -> (string)
              The signing algorithm for the certificate.

          KeyLength -> (integer)
              The key length of the cryptographic algorithm being used.
