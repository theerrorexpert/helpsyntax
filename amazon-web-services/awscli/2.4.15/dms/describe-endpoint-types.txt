DESCRIBE-ENDPOINT-TYPES()                            DESCRIBE-ENDPOINT-TYPES()



NAME
       describe-endpoint-types -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about the type of endpoints available.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-endpoint-types  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: SupportedEndpointTypes

SYNOPSIS
            describe-endpoint-types
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Filters applied to the endpoint types.

          Valid filter names: engine-name | endpoint-type

          (structure)
              Identifies the name and value of a filter object. This filter is
              used  to  limit  the  number  and  type  of DMS objects that are
              returned for a particular Describe* call or  similar  operation.
              Filters are used as an optional parameter for certain API opera-
              tions.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter as specified for a Describe* or  simi-
                 lar operation.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  value, which can specify one or more values used
                 to narrow the returned results.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the available endpoint types

       The  following describe-endpoint-types example lists the MySQL endpoint
       types that are available.

          aws dms describe-endpoint-types \
              --filters "Name=engine-name,Values=mysql"

       Output:

          {
              "SupportedEndpointTypes": [
                  {
                      "EngineName": "mysql",
                      "SupportsCDC": true,
                      "EndpointType": "source",
                      "EngineDisplayName": "MySQL"
                  },
                  {
                      "EngineName": "mysql",
                      "SupportsCDC": true,
                      "EndpointType": "target",
                      "EngineDisplayName": "MySQL"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter  is  specified,  the response includes only records beyond
          the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .

       SupportedEndpointTypes -> (list)
          The types of endpoints that are supported.

          (structure)
              Provides information  about  types  of  supported  endpoints  in
              response  to  a  request by the DescribeEndpointTypes operation.
              This information includes the type  of  endpoint,  the  database
              engine name, and whether change data capture (CDC) is supported.

              EngineName -> (string)
                 The database engine name. Valid values, depending on the End-
                 pointType,  include  "mysql" , "oracle" , "postgres" , "mari-
                 adb" , "aurora" , "aurora-postgresql" , "redshift" ,  "s3"  ,
                 "db2"  ,  "azuredb"  ,  "sybase"  ,  "dynamodb" , "mongodb" ,
                 "kinesis"  ,  "kafka"  ,  "elasticsearch"  ,  "documentdb"  ,
                 "sqlserver" , and "neptune" .

              SupportsCDC -> (boolean)
                 Indicates if change data capture (CDC) is supported.

              EndpointType -> (string)
                 The type of endpoint. Valid values are source and target .

              ReplicationInstanceEngineMinimumVersion -> (string)
                 The  earliest  DMS engine version that supports this endpoint
                 engine. Note that endpoint engines released with DMS versions
                 earlier  than 3.1.1 do not return a value for this parameter.

              EngineDisplayName -> (string)
                 The expanded name for the engine name. For  example,  if  the
                 EngineName parameter is "aurora," this value would be "Amazon
                 Aurora MySQL."
