       create-replication-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates the replication instance using the specified parameters.

       DMS requires that your account have certain roles with appropriate per-
       missions before you can create a replication instance. For  information
       on  the  required roles, see Creating the IAM Roles to Use With the CLI
       and DMS API . For information on the required permissions, see IAM Per-
       missions Needed to Use DMS .

          the replication instance.

       --replication-instance-class (string)
          The  compute  and  memory  capacity  of  the replication instance as
          defined for the specified replication instance class. For example to
          specify  the  instance  class  dms.c4.large,  set  this parameter to
          "dms.c4.large" .

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --availability-zone (string)
          The Availability Zone where the replication instance  will  be  cre-
          ated. The default value is a random, system-chosen Availability Zone
          in  the  endpoint's  Amazon  Web  Services  Region,   for   example:
          us-east-1d

       --replication-subnet-group-identifier (string)
          A subnet group to associate with the replication instance.

       --preferred-maintenance-window (string)

       --multi-az | --no-multi-az (boolean)
          Specifies whether the replication instance is a Multi-AZ deployment.
          You can't set the AvailabilityZone parameter if the Multi-AZ parame-
          ter is set to true .

       --engine-version (string)
          The engine version number of the replication instance.

          If an engine version number is  not  specified  when  a  replication
          instance is created, the default is the latest engine version avail-
          able.

       --auto-minor-version-upgrade     |      --no-auto-minor-version-upgrade
       (boolean)
          A  value  that  indicates  whether minor engine upgrades are applied
          automatically to the replication  instance  during  the  maintenance
          window. This parameter defaults to true .

          Default: true

       --tags (list)
          One or more tags to be assigned to the replication instance.

          (structure)
              A  user-defined  key-value pair that describes metadata added to
              an DMS resource and that is used by operations such as the  fol-
              lowing:

              o AddTagsToResource

              o ListTagsForResource

              o RemoveTagsFromResource

              Key -> (string)
                 A  key  is the required name of the tag. The string value can
                 be 1-128 Unicode characters in length and can't  be  prefixed
                 with  "aws:"  or "dms:". The string can only contain only the
                 set of Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_',  '.',  '/',
                 '=',      '+',     '-'     (Java     regular     expressions:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A value is the optional value of the tag.  The  string  value
                 can  be  1-256 Unicode characters in length and can't be pre-
                 fixed with "aws:" or "dms:". The string can only contain only
                 the  set  of  Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_', '.',
                 '/',   '=',   '+',    '-'    (Java    regular    expressions:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) string that uniquely identi-
                 fies the resource for which the tag is created.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string,ResourceArn=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string",
              "ResourceArn": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --kms-key-id (string)
          An KMS key identifier that is used to encrypt the data on the repli-
          cation instance.

          If  you  don't  specify a value for the KmsKeyId parameter, then DMS
          uses your default encryption key.

          KMS creates the default encryption key for your Amazon Web  Services
          account.  Your  Amazon  Web Services account has a different default
          encryption key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

       --publicly-accessible | --no-publicly-accessible (boolean)
          Specifies the accessibility options for the replication instance.  A
          value  of  true  represents  an instance with a public IP address. A
          value of false represents an instance with a private IP address. The
          default value is true .

       --dns-name-servers (string)
          A  list  of  custom  DNS  name servers supported for the replication
          instance to access your on-premise source or target  database.  This
          list overrides the default name servers supported by the replication
          instance.  You  can  specify  a  comma-separated  list  of  internet
          addresses  for  up to four on-premise DNS name servers. For example:
          "1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2,3.3.3.3,4.4.4.4"

       --resource-identifier (string)
          A friendly name for the resource identifier at the end of  the  End-
          pointArn response parameter that is returned in the created Endpoint
          object. The value for this parameter can have up to  31  characters.
          It  can  contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphen ('-'). Also,
          it can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive  hyphens,  and
          can  only  begin with a letter, such as Example-App-ARN1 . For exam-
          ple,  this   value   might   result   in   the   EndpointArn   value
          arn:aws:dms:eu-west-1:012345678901:rep:Example-App-ARN1   .  If  you
          don't specify a ResourceIdentifier value, DMS  generates  a  default
          identifier value for the end of EndpointArn .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

                 as defined for the specified replication instance class.

                 For  more  information on the settings and capacities for the
                 available replication instance  classes,  see  Selecting  the
                 right DMS replication instance for your migration .

              AllocatedStorage -> (integer)
                 The  amount  of  storage (in gigabytes) that is allocated for
                 the replication instance.

              MultiAZ -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether the  replication  instance  is  a  Multi-AZ
                 deployment.  You  can't set the AvailabilityZone parameter if
                 the Multi-AZ parameter is set to true .

              EngineVersion -> (string)
                 The engine version number of the replication instance.

          MultiAZ -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether the replication instance is a Multi-AZ deploy-
              ment.  You  can't  set  the  AvailabilityZone  parameter  if the
              Multi-AZ parameter is set to true .

          EngineVersion -> (string)
              The engine version number of the replication instance.

              If an engine version number is not specified when a  replication
              instance  is  created,  the default is the latest engine version
              available.

              When modifying a major engine version of an instance,  also  set
              AllowMajorVersionUpgrade to true .

          AutoMinorVersionUpgrade -> (boolean)
              Boolean value indicating if minor version upgrades will be auto-
              matically applied to the instance.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              An KMS key identifier that is used to encrypt the  data  on  the
              replication instance.

              If  you  don't  specify a value for the KmsKeyId parameter, then
              DMS uses your default encryption key.

              KMS creates the default encryption key for your Amazon Web  Ser-
              vices  account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different
              default encryption key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

          ReplicationInstanceArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the replication instance.

          ReplicationInstancePublicIpAddress -> (string)
              The public IP address of the replication instance.

          ReplicationInstancePrivateIpAddress -> (string)
              The private IP address of the replication instance.

          ReplicationInstancePublicIpAddresses -> (list)
              One or more public IP addresses for the replication instance.

              (string)

          ReplicationInstancePrivateIpAddresses -> (list)
              One or more private IP addresses for the replication instance.

              (string)

          PubliclyAccessible -> (boolean)
              Specifies  the  accessibility  options   for   the   replication
              instance.  A  value of true represents an instance with a public
              IP address. A value of false represents an instance with a  pri-
              vate IP address. The default value is true .

          SecondaryAvailabilityZone -> (string)
              The  Availability  Zone of the standby replication instance in a
              Multi-AZ deployment.

          FreeUntil -> (timestamp)
              The expiration date of the free  replication  instance  that  is
              part of the Free DMS program.

          DnsNameServers -> (string)
