DESCRIPTION

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-event-subscription
          --subscription-name <value>
          [--sns-topic-arn <value>]
          [--source-type <value>]
          [--event-categories <value>]
          [--enabled | --no-enabled]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subscription-name (string)
          The  name of the DMS event notification subscription to be modified.

       --sns-topic-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic  created  for
          event notification. The ARN is created by Amazon SNS when you create
          a topic and subscribe to it.

       --source-type (string)
          The type of DMS resource that generates the events you want to  sub-
          scribe to.

          Valid values: replication-instance | replication-task

       --event-categories (list)
          A  list  of event categories for a source type that you want to sub-
          scribe to. Use the DescribeEventCategories action to see a  list  of
          event categories.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --enabled | --no-enabled (boolean)
          A Boolean value; set to true to activate the subscription.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To modify an event subscription

       The following modify-event-subscription example changes the source type
       of an event subscription.

          aws dms modify-event-subscription \
              --subscription-name "my-dms-events" \
              --source-type replication-task

       Output:

          {
              "EventSubscription": {
                  "CustomerAwsId": "123456789012",
                  "CustSubscriptionId": "my-dms-events",
                  "SnsTopicArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:my-sns-topic",
                  "Status": "modifying",
                  "SubscriptionCreationTime": "2020-05-29 17:04:40.262",
                  "SourceType": "replication-task",
                  "Enabled": true
              }
          }

          CustomerAwsId -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services customer account associated with the DMS

              The status "no-permission" indicates that DMS no longer has per-

              The time the DMS event notification subscription was created.

          SourceType -> (string)
              The type of DMS resource that generates events.

              Valid values: replication-instance | replication-server |  secu-
              rity-group | replication-task

          SourceIdsList -> (list)
              A list of source Ids for the event subscription.

              (string)

          EventCategoriesList -> (list)
              A lists of event categories.

              (string)

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Boolean  value  that  indicates  if  the  event  subscription is
