CANCEL-REPLICATION-TASK-ASSESSMENT-RUNCANCEL-REPLICATION-TASK-ASSESSMENT-RUN()



NAME
       cancel-replication-task-assessment-run -

DESCRIPTION
       Cancels a single premigration assessment run.

       This operation prevents any individual assessments from running if they
       haven't started running. It also  attempts  to  cancel  any  individual
       assessments that are currently running.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            cancel-replication-task-assessment-run
          --replication-task-assessment-run-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --replication-task-assessment-run-arn (string)
          Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the premigration assessment run to be
          canceled.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
