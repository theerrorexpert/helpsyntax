OPTIONS
       --replication-task-identifier (string)
          An identifier for the replication task.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain 1-255 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.

          o First character must be a letter.

          o Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

       --source-endpoint-arn (string)
          An  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies the source
          endpoint.

       --target-endpoint-arn (string)
          An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely  identifies  the  target
          endpoint.

       --replication-instance-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a replication instance.

       --migration-type (string)
          The    migration   type.   Valid   values:   full-load   |   cdc   |
          full-load-and-cdc

          Possible values:

          o full-load

          o cdc

          o full-load-and-cdc

       --table-mappings (string)
          The table mappings for the task, in JSON format. For  more  informa-
          tion,  see Using Table Mapping to Specify Task Settings in the Data-
          base Migration Service User Guide.

       --replication-task-settings (string)
          Overall settings for the task, in JSON format. For more information,
          see Specifying Task Settings for Database Migration Service Tasks in
          the Database Migration Service User Guide.

       --cdc-start-time (timestamp)
          Indicates the start time for a change data capture (CDC)  operation.
          Use either CdcStartTime or CdcStartPosition to specify when you want
          a CDC operation to start.  Specifying  both  values  results  in  an
          error.

          Timestamp Example: --cdc-start-time 2018-03-08T12:12:12

       --cdc-start-position (string)
          Indicates  when  you  want  a change data capture (CDC) operation to
          start. Use either CdcStartPosition or CdcStartTime to  specify  when
          you want a CDC operation to start. Specifying both values results in
          an error.

          The value can be in date, checkpoint, or LSN/SCN format.

          Date Example: --cdc-start-position 2018-03-08T12:12:12

          Checkpoint       Example:        --cdc-start-position        "check-

          LSN Example: --cdc-start-position mysql-bin-changelog.000024:373

          NOTE:
              When you use this task setting with a  source  PostgreSQL  data-
              base,  a  logical replication slot should already be created and
              associated with the source endpoint. You can verify this by set-
              ting the slotName extra connection attribute to the name of this
              logical replication slot. For more information, see  Extra  Con-
              nection Attributes When Using PostgreSQL as a Source for DMS .

       --cdc-stop-position (string)
          Indicates  when  you  want  a change data capture (CDC) operation to
          stop. The value can be either server time or commit time.

          Server          time          example:           --cdc-stop-position
          server_time:2018-02-09T12:12:12

          Commit     time     example:     --cdc-stop-position    commit_time:
          2018-02-09T12:12:12

       --tags (list)
          One or more tags to be assigned to the replication task.

          (structure)
              A user-defined key-value pair that describes metadata  added  to
              an  DMS resource and that is used by operations such as the fol-
              lowing:

              o AddTagsToResource

              o ListTagsForResource

              o RemoveTagsFromResource

              Key -> (string)
                 A key is the required name of the tag. The string  value  can
                 be  1-128  Unicode characters in length and can't be prefixed
                 with "aws:" or "dms:". The string can only contain  only  the
                 set  of  Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_', '.', '/',
                 '=',     '+',     '-'     (Java     regular      expressions:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A  value  is  the optional value of the tag. The string value
                 can be 1-256 Unicode characters in length and can't  be  pre-
                 fixed with "aws:" or "dms:". The string can only contain only
                 the set of Unicode letters, digits,  white-space,  '_',  '.',
                 '/',    '=',    '+',    '-'    (Java   regular   expressions:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) string that  uniquely  identi-
                 fies the resource for which the tag is created.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string,ResourceArn=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string",
              "ResourceArn": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --task-data (string)
          Supplemental  information that the task requires to migrate the data
          for certain source and target endpoints. For more  information,  see
          Specifying  Supplemental  Data  for  Task  Settings  in the Database
          Migration Service User Guide.

       --resource-identifier (string)
          A friendly name for the resource identifier at the end of  the  End-
          pointArn response parameter that is returned in the created Endpoint
          object. The value for this parameter can have up to  31  characters.
          It  can  contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphen ('-'). Also,
          it can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive  hyphens,  and
          can  only  begin with a letter, such as Example-App-ARN1 . For exam-
          ple,  this   value   might   result   in   the   EndpointArn   value
          arn:aws:dms:eu-west-1:012345678901:rep:Example-App-ARN1   .  If  you
          don't specify a ResourceIdentifier value, DMS  generates  a  default
          identifier value for the end of EndpointArn .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 is  an improved premigration task assessment operation. The `
                 StartReplicationTaskAssessment
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTaskAssessment.html`__
                 operation assesses data type compatibility only  between  the
                 source and target database of a given migration task. In con-
                 trast,          `           StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun.html`__
                 enables you to specify a variety of premigration task assess-
                 ments  in  addition to data type compatibility. These assess-
                 ments include ones for the validity of  primary  key  defini-
                 tions  and likely issues with database migration performance,
                 among others.

          LastFailureMessage -> (string)
              The last error (failure) message generated for  the  replication
              task.

          StopReason -> (string)
              The  reason  the  replication  task  was  stopped. This response
              parameter can return one of the following values:

              o "STOP_REASON_FULL_LOAD_COMPLETED"   Full-load  migration  com-
                pleted.

              o "STOP_REASON_CACHED_CHANGES_APPLIED"    Change   data  capture
                (CDC) load completed.

              o "STOP_REASON_CACHED_CHANGES_NOT_APPLIED"  In a  full-load  and
                CDC  migration,  the  full  load  stopped  as specified before
                starting the CDC migration.

              o "STOP_REASON_SERVER_TIME"  The migration stopped at the speci-
                fied server time.

          ReplicationTaskCreationDate -> (timestamp)
              The date the replication task was created.

          ReplicationTaskStartDate -> (timestamp)
              The date the replication task is scheduled to start.

          CdcStartPosition -> (string)
              Indicates when you want a change data capture (CDC) operation to
              start. Use either CdcStartPosition or  CdcStartTime  to  specify
              when you want the CDC operation to start. Specifying both values
              results in an error.

              The value can be in date, checkpoint, or LSN/SCN format.

              Date Example: --cdc-start-position 2018-03-08T12:12:12

              Checkpoint      Example:      --cdc-start-position       "check-
              point:V1#27#mysql-bin-changelog.157832:1975:-1:2002:677883278264080:mysql-bin-changelog.157832:1876#0#0#*#0#93"

              LSN Example: --cdc-start-position mysql-bin-changelog.000024:373

          CdcStopPosition -> (string)
              Indicates when you want a change data capture (CDC) operation to
              stop. The value can be either server time or commit time.

              Server         time         example:         --cdc-stop-position
              server_time:2018-02-09T12:12:12

              Commit    time    example:    --cdc-stop-position   commit_time:
              2018-02-09T12:12:12

          RecoveryCheckpoint -> (string)
              Indicates the last checkpoint that occurred during a change data
              capture  (CDC) operation. You can provide this value to the Cdc-
              StartPosition parameter to start a CDC operation that begins  at
              that checkpoint.

          ReplicationTaskArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the replication task.

          ReplicationTaskStats -> (structure)
              The  statistics  for  the  task,  including elapsed time, tables
              loaded, and table errors.

              FullLoadProgressPercent -> (integer)
                 The percent complete for the full load migration task.

              ElapsedTimeMillis -> (long)
                 The elapsed time of the task, in milliseconds.

              TablesLoaded -> (integer)
                 The number of tables loaded for this task.

              TablesLoading -> (integer)
                 The number of tables currently loading for this task.

              TablesQueued -> (integer)
                 The number of tables queued for this task.

              TablesErrored -> (integer)
                 The number of errors that have occurred during this task.

              FreshStartDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date the replication task was started either with a fresh
                 start or a target reload.

              StartDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date the replication task was started either with a fresh
                 start   or   a   resume.   For    more    information,    see
                 StartReplicationTaskType .

              StopDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date the replication task was stopped.

              FullLoadStartDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date the replication task full load was started.

              FullLoadFinishDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date the replication task full load was completed.

          TaskData -> (string)
              Supplemental  information  that the task requires to migrate the
              data for certain source and target endpoints. For more  informa-
              tion,  see Specifying Supplemental Data for Task Settings in the
              Database Migration Service User Guide.

          TargetReplicationInstanceArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the replication instance to which this task is  moved
              in    response    to    running    the   `   MoveReplicationTask
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_MoveReplicationTask.html`__
              operation.  Otherwise, this response parameter isn't a member of
              the ReplicationTask object.
