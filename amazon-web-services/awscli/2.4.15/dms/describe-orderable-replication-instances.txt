NAME
       describe-orderable-replication-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  the replication instance types that can be
       created in the specified region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-orderable-replication-instances is a paginated operation. Mul-
       tiple  API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set
       of results. You can disable pagination by providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: OrderableReplicationInstances

SYNOPSIS
            describe-orderable-replication-instances
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       OrderableReplicationInstances -> (list)
          The order-able replication instances available.

          (structure)
              In response to the DescribeOrderableReplicationInstances  opera-
              tion,  this  object describes an available replication instance.
              This  description  includes  the  replication  instance's  type,
              engine version, and allocated storage.

              EngineVersion -> (string)
                 The version of the replication engine.

              ReplicationInstanceClass -> (string)
                 The  compute  and memory capacity of the replication instance
                 as defined for the specified replication instance class.  For
                 example  to specify the instance class dms.c4.large, set this
                 parameter to "dms.c4.large" .

                 For more information on the settings and capacities  for  the
                 available  replication  instance  classes,  see Selecting the
                 right DMS replication instance for your migration .

              StorageType -> (string)
                 The type of storage used by the replication instance.

              MinAllocatedStorage -> (integer)
                 The minimum amount of storage  (in  gigabytes)  that  can  be
                 allocated for the replication instance.

              MaxAllocatedStorage -> (integer)
                 The  minimum  amount  of  storage  (in gigabytes) that can be
                 allocated for the replication instance.

              DefaultAllocatedStorage -> (integer)
                 The default amount of storage (in gigabytes)  that  is  allo-
                 cated for the replication instance.

              IncludedAllocatedStorage -> (integer)
                 The  amount  of  storage (in gigabytes) that is allocated for
                 the replication instance.

              AvailabilityZones -> (list)
                 List of Availability Zones for this replication instance.

                 (string)

              ReleaseStatus -> (string)
                 The value returned when the specified  EngineVersion  of  the
                 replication  instance is in Beta or test mode. This indicates
                 some features might not work as expected.

                 NOTE:
                     DMS supports  the  ReleaseStatus  parameter  in  versions
                     3.1.4 and later.

       Marker -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter is specified, the response includes  only  records  beyond
          the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .
