NAME
       describe-replication-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about replication instances for your account in the
       current region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-replication-instances is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: ReplicationInstances

SYNOPSIS
            describe-replication-instances
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Filters applied to replication instances.

          Valid    filter    names:    replication-instance-arn   |   replica-
          tion-instance-id | replication-instance-class | engine-version

          (structure)
              Identifies the name and value of a filter object. This filter is
              used  to  limit  the  number  and  type  of DMS objects that are
              returned for a particular Describe* call or  similar  operation.
              Filters are used as an optional parameter for certain API opera-
              tions.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter as specified for a Describe* or  simi-
                 lar operation.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  value, which can specify one or more values used
                 to narrow the returned results.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     Specifies  whether the replication instance is a Multi-AZ
                     deployment. You can't set the AvailabilityZone  parameter

                 If  an engine version number is not specified when a replica-
                 tion instance is created, the default is  the  latest  engine
                 version available.

                 When  modifying  a  major engine version of an instance, also
                 set AllowMajorVersionUpgrade to true .

              AutoMinorVersionUpgrade -> (boolean)
                 Boolean value indicating if minor version  upgrades  will  be
                 automatically applied to the instance.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 An KMS key identifier that is used to encrypt the data on the
                 replication instance.

                 If you don't specify a value for the KmsKeyId parameter, then
                 DMS uses your default encryption key.

                 KMS  creates  the  default encryption key for your Amazon Web
                 Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a dif-
                 ferent  default  encryption  key for each Amazon Web Services
                 Region.

              ReplicationInstanceArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the replication instance.

              ReplicationInstancePublicIpAddress -> (string)
                 The public IP address of the replication instance.

              ReplicationInstancePrivateIpAddress -> (string)
                 The private IP address of the replication instance.

              ReplicationInstancePublicIpAddresses -> (list)
                 One or more public IP addresses for the replication instance.

                 (string)

              ReplicationInstancePrivateIpAddresses -> (list)
                 One   or  more  private  IP  addresses  for  the  replication
                 instance.

                 (string)

              PubliclyAccessible -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  the  accessibility  options  for  the  replication
                 instance.  A value of true represents an instance with a pub-
                 lic IP address. A value of false represents an instance  with
                 a private IP address. The default value is true .

              SecondaryAvailabilityZone -> (string)
                 The  Availability Zone of the standby replication instance in
                 a Multi-AZ deployment.

              FreeUntil -> (timestamp)
                 The expiration date of the free replication instance that  is
                 part of the Free DMS program.

              DnsNameServers -> (string)
                 The  DNS  name servers supported for the replication instance
                 to access your on-premise source or target database.
