SYNOPSIS
            describe-pending-maintenance-actions
          [--replication-instance-arn <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--marker <value>]
          [--max-records <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --replication-instance-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the replication instance.

       --filters (list)
          (structure)
              Identifies the name and value of a filter object. This filter is
              used to limit the number  and  type  of  DMS  objects  that  are
              returned  for  a particular Describe* call or similar operation.
              Filters are used as an optional parameter for certain API opera-
              tions.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name of the filter as specified for a Describe* or simi-
                 lar operation.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter value, which can specify one or more  values  used
                 to narrow the returned results.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --marker (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter is specified, the response includes  only  records  beyond
          the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .

       --max-records (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of records to include in the response. If more
          records exist than the  specified  MaxRecords  value,  a  pagination
          token  called  a  marker  is  included  in  the response so that the
          remaining results can be retrieved.

          Default: 100

          Constraints: Minimum 20, maximum 100.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PendingMaintenanceActions -> (list)
          The pending maintenance action.

          (structure)
              Identifies an DMS resource and any pending actions for it.

              ResourceIdentifier -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the DMS resource  that  the
                 pending  maintenance action applies to. For information about
                 creating an ARN, see Constructing  an  Amazon  Resource  Name
                 (ARN) for DMS in the DMS documentation.

              PendingMaintenanceActionDetails -> (list)
                 Detailed information about the pending maintenance action.

                 (structure)
                     Describes   a  maintenance  action  pending  for  an  DMS
                     resource, including when and how it will be applied. This
                     data  type  is a response element to the DescribePending-
                     MaintenanceActions operation.

                     Action -> (string)
                        The type of pending maintenance action that is  avail-
                        able for the resource.

                     AutoAppliedAfterDate -> (timestamp)
                        The  date of the maintenance window when the action is
                        to be applied. The maintenance action  is  applied  to
                        the resource during its first maintenance window after
                        this date. If this date is specified, any next-mainte-
                        nance opt-in requests are ignored.

                     ForcedApplyDate -> (timestamp)
                        The date when the maintenance action will be automati-
                        cally applied. The maintenance action  is  applied  to
                        the  resource  on  this date regardless of the mainte-
                        nance window for the resource. If this date is  speci-
                        fied, any immediate opt-in requests are ignored.

                     OptInStatus -> (string)
                        The  type of opt-in request that has been received for
                        the resource.

                     CurrentApplyDate -> (timestamp)
                        The effective date when the pending maintenance action
                        will  be applied to the resource. This date takes into
                        account opt-in requests received from  the  ApplyPend-
                        ingMaintenanceAction   API  operation,  and  also  the
                        AutoAppliedAfterDate  and  ForcedApplyDate   parameter
                        values.  This  value is blank if an opt-in request has
                        not been received and nothing has been  specified  for
                        AutoAppliedAfterDate or ForcedApplyDate .

                     Description -> (string)
                        A  description providing more detail about the mainte-
                        nance action.

       Marker -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter  is  specified,  the response includes only records beyond
          the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .
