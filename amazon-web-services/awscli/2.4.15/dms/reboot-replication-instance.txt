REBOOT-REPLICATION-INSTANCE()                    REBOOT-REPLICATION-INSTANCE()



NAME
       reboot-replication-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Reboots  a  replication instance. Rebooting results in a momentary out-
       age, until the replication instance becomes available again.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            reboot-replication-instance
          --replication-instance-arn <value>
          [--force-failover | --no-force-failover]
          [--force-planned-failover | --no-force-planned-failover]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --replication-instance-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the replication instance.

       --force-failover | --no-force-failover (boolean)
          If this parameter is true  ,  the  reboot  is  conducted  through  a
          Multi-AZ  failover.  If  the instance isn't configured for Multi-AZ,
          then  you  can't  specify  true  .  (  --force-planned-failover  and
          --force-failover can't both be set to true .)

       --force-planned-failover | --no-force-planned-failover (boolean)
          If  this  parameter  is  true  ,  the  reboot is conducted through a
          planned Multi-AZ failover where resources are released  and  cleaned
          up  prior to conducting the failover. If the instance isn''t config-
          ured   for   Multi-AZ,   then   you   can't   specify   true   .   (
          --force-planned-failover  and  --force-failover can't both be set to
          true .)

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 The amount of storage (in gigabytes) that  is  allocated  for
                 the replication instance.

                 Specifies  whether  the  replication  instance  is a Multi-AZ
                 deployment. You can't set the AvailabilityZone  parameter  if
                 the Multi-AZ parameter is set to true .

              ment. You  can't  set  the  AvailabilityZone  parameter  if  the
              Multi-AZ parameter is set to true .

              If  an engine version number is not specified when a replication

              If you don't specify a value for the  KmsKeyId  parameter,  then
              DMS uses your default encryption key.

              KMS  creates the default encryption key for your Amazon Web Ser-
              vices account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a  different
              default encryption key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

              Specifies   the   accessibility   options  for  the  replication
              instance. A value of true represents an instance with  a  public
              IP  address. A value of false represents an instance with a pri-
              vate IP address. The default value is true .

          SecondaryAvailabilityZone -> (string)
              The Availability Zone of the standby replication instance  in  a
              Multi-AZ deployment.

              The  expiration  date  of  the free replication instance that is
              part of the Free DMS program.
