NAME
       describe-replication-task-assessment-results -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the task assessment results from the Amazon S3 bucket that DMS
       creates in your Amazon Web Services account. This action always returns
       the latest results.

       For  more  information  about DMS task assessments, see Creating a task
       assessment report in the Database Migration Service User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-replication-task-assessment-results is a paginated  operation.
       Multiple  API  calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data
       set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the  --no-pagi-
       nate  argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a
       paginated response, the --query argument must  extract  data  from  the
       results  of  the following query expressions: ReplicationTaskAssessmen-
       tResults

SYNOPSIS
            describe-replication-task-assessment-results
          [--replication-task-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --replication-task-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) string that uniquely  identifies  the
          task.  When  this input parameter is specified, the API returns only
          one result and ignore the values of the MaxRecords and Marker param-
          eters.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size  results  in  more  calls to the AWS service,
          retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 assessment was run.

              ReplicationTaskArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the replication task.

              ReplicationTaskLastAssessmentDate -> (timestamp)
