NAME
       apply-pending-maintenance-action -

DESCRIPTION
       Applies  a  pending maintenance action to a resource (for example, to a
       replication instance).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            apply-pending-maintenance-action
          --replication-instance-arn <value>
          --apply-action <value>
          --opt-in-type <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --replication-instance-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the DMS resource that the  pending
          maintenance action applies to.

       --apply-action (string)
          The pending maintenance action to apply to this resource.

          Valid values: os-upgrade , system-update , db-upgrade

       --opt-in-type (string)
          A  value  that  specifies  the  type of opt-in request, or undoes an
          opt-in request. You can't undo an opt-in request of type immediate .

          Valid values:

          o immediate - Apply the maintenance action immediately.

          o next-maintenance  -  Apply  the maintenance action during the next
            maintenance window for the resource.

          o undo-opt-in  -  Cancel  any   existing   next-maintenance   opt-in
            requests.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ResourcePendingMaintenanceActions -> (structure)
          The DMS resource that the pending maintenance action will be applied
          to.

          ResourceIdentifier -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  DMS  resource  that  the
              pending  maintenance  action  applies  to. For information about
              creating an ARN, see Constructing an Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)
              for DMS in the DMS documentation.

          PendingMaintenanceActionDetails -> (list)
              Detailed information about the pending maintenance action.

              (structure)
                 Describes  a  maintenance action pending for an DMS resource,
                 including when and how it will be applied. This data type  is
                 a  response  element to the DescribePendingMaintenanceActions
                 operation.

                 Action -> (string)
                     The type of pending maintenance action that is  available
                     for the resource.

                 AutoAppliedAfterDate -> (timestamp)
                     The  date of the maintenance window when the action is to
                     be applied. The maintenance  action  is  applied  to  the
                     resource  during  its first maintenance window after this
                     date. If this date  is  specified,  any  next-maintenance
                     opt-in requests are ignored.

                 ForcedApplyDate -> (timestamp)
                     The  date  when  the maintenance action will be automati-
                     cally applied. The maintenance action is applied  to  the
                     resource  on this date regardless of the maintenance win-
                     dow for the resource. If  this  date  is  specified,  any
                     immediate opt-in requests are ignored.

                 OptInStatus -> (string)
                     The type of opt-in request that has been received for the
                     resource.

                 CurrentApplyDate -> (timestamp)
                     The effective date when the  pending  maintenance  action
                     will  be  applied  to  the resource. This date takes into
                     account opt-in requests received from  the  ApplyPending-
                     MaintenanceAction  API  operation,  and  also the AutoAp-
                     pliedAfterDate and ForcedApplyDate parameter values. This
                     value is blank if an opt-in request has not been received
                     and nothing has been specified  for  AutoAppliedAfterDate
                     or ForcedApplyDate .

                 Description -> (string)
                     A description providing more detail about the maintenance
                     action.
