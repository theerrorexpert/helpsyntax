DESCRIBE-EVENTS()                                            DESCRIBE-EVENTS()



NAME
       describe-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  events  for  a  given source identifier and source type. You can
       also specify a start and end time. For more information on DMS  events,
       see  Working  with  Events  and Notifications in the Database Migration
       Service User Guide.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-events is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Events

            describe-events
          [--source-identifier <value>]
          [--source-type <value>]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-identifier (string)
          The identifier of an event source.

       --source-type (string)
          The type of DMS resource that generates events.

          Valid values: replication-instance | replication-task

          Possible values:

          o replication-instance

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The start time for the events to be listed.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end time for the events to be listed.

       --duration (integer)
          The duration of the events to be listed.

       --event-categories (list)
          A list of event categories for the source type that you've chosen.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          Filters  applied  to  events.  The  only  valid  filter  is replica-
          tion-instance-id .

          (structure)
              Identifies the name and value of a filter object. This filter is
              used  to  limit  the  number  and  type  of DMS objects that are
              returned for a particular Describe* call or  similar  operation.
              Filters are used as an optional parameter for certain API opera-
              tions.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter as specified for a Describe* or  simi-
                 lar operation.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  value, which can specify one or more values used
                 to narrow the returned results.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list DMS events

       The  following describe-events example lists the events that originated
       from a replication instance.

          aws dms describe-events \
              --source-type "replication-instance"

       Output:

          {
              "Events": [
                  {
                      "SourceIdentifier": "my-repl-instance",
                      "SourceType": "replication-instance",
                      "Message": "Replication application shutdown",
                      "EventCategories": [],
                      "Date": 1590771645.776
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter is specified, the response includes  only  records  beyond
          the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .

       Events -> (list)
          The events described.

          (structure)
              Describes  an  identifiable  significant activity that affects a
              replication instance or task. This object can provide  the  mes-
              sage, the available event categories, the date and source of the
              event, and the DMS resource type.

              SourceIdentifier -> (string)
                 The identifier of an event source.

              SourceType -> (string)
                 The type of DMS resource that generates events.

                 Valid values:  replication-instance  |  endpoint  |  replica-
                 tion-task

              Message -> (string)
                 The event message.

              EventCategories -> (list)
                 The event categories available for the specified source type.

                 (string)

              Date -> (timestamp)
                 The date of the event.
