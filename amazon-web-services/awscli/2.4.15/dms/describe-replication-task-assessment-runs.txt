DESCRIBE-REPLICATION-TASK-ASSESSMENDESCRIBE-REPLICATION-TASK-ASSESSMENT-RUNS()



NAME
       describe-replication-task-assessment-runs -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a paginated list of premigration assessment runs based on fil-
       ter settings.

       These filter settings can specify a combination of premigration assess-
       ment  runs,  migration tasks, replication instances, and assessment run
       status values.

       NOTE:
          This operation doesn't return information about  individual  assess-
          ments. For this information, see the DescribeReplicationTaskIndivid-
          ualAssessments operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-replication-task-assessment-runs
          [--filters <value>]
          [--max-records <value>]
          [--marker <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Filters applied to the premigration assessment runs described in the
          form of key-value pairs.

          Valid  filter  names: replication-task-assessment-run-arn , replica-
          tion-task-arn , replication-instance-arn , status

          (structure)
              Identifies the name and value of a filter object. This filter is
              used  to  limit  the  number  and  type  of DMS objects that are
              returned for a particular Describe* call or  similar  operation.
              Filters are used as an optional parameter for certain API opera-
              tions.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter as specified for a Describe* or  simi-
                 lar operation.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  value, which can specify one or more values used
                 to narrow the returned results.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-records (integer)
          The maximum number of records to include in the  response.  If  more
          records  exist  than  the  specified  MaxRecords value, a pagination
          token called a marker is  included  in  the  response  so  that  the
          remaining results can be retrieved.

       --marker (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter is specified, the response includes  only  records  beyond
          the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          A pagination token returned for you to pass to a subsequent request.
          If you pass this token as the Marker value in a subsequent  request,
          the  response  includes  only  records  beyond the marker, up to the
          value specified in the request by MaxRecords .

       ReplicationTaskAssessmentRuns -> (list)
          One or more premigration assessment runs as specified by Filters .

          (structure)
              Provides information that describes  a  premigration  assessment
              run  that you have started using the StartReplicationTaskAssess-
              mentRun operation.

              Some of the information appears based on other  operations  that
              can return the ReplicationTaskAssessmentRun object.

                 assessment run.

              Status -> (string)
                 Assessment run status.

                 This status can have one of the following values:

                 o "cancelling"  The assessment run was canceled by  the  Can-
                   celReplicationTaskAssessmentRun operation.

                 o "deleting"    The   assessment   run  was  deleted  by  the

                   a failed status.

                 o "error-provisioning"   An  internal  error  occurred  while
                   resources were provisioned (during provisioning status).

                 o "error-executing"  An internal error occurred  while  indi-
                   vidual assessments ran (during running status).

                 o "invalid state"  The assessment run is in an unknown state.

                 o "passed"  All individual assessments  have  completed,  and
                   none has a failed status.

                 o "provisioning"    Resources   required  to  run  individual
                   assessments are being provisioned.

                 o "running"  Individual assessments are being run.

                 o "starting"  The assessment run is starting,  but  resources
                   are not yet being provisioned for individual assessments.

              ReplicationTaskAssessmentRunCreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 Date  on  which  the  assessment  run  was  created using the
                 StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun operation.

              AssessmentProgress -> (structure)
                 Indication of the  completion  progress  for  the  individual
                 assessments specified to run.

                 IndividualAssessmentCount -> (integer)
                     The  number  of individual assessments that are specified
                     to run.

                 using the  StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun  operation.  The
                 role must allow the iam:PassRole action.
