DESCRIBE-REPLICATION-TASK-INDESCRIBE-REPLICATION-TASK-INDIVIDUAL-ASSESSMENTS()



NAME
       describe-replication-task-individual-assessments -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a paginated list of individual assessments based on filter set-
       tings.

       These filter settings can specify a combination of premigration assess-
       ment runs, migration tasks, and assessment status values.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-replication-task-individual-assessments
          [--filters <value>]
          [--max-records <value>]
          [--marker <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Filters  applied to the individual assessments described in the form
          of key-value pairs.

          Valid filter names: replication-task-assessment-run-arn  ,  replica-
          tion-task-arn , status

          (structure)
              Identifies the name and value of a filter object. This filter is
              used to limit the number  and  type  of  DMS  objects  that  are
              returned  for  a particular Describe* call or similar operation.
              Filters are used as an optional parameter for certain API opera-
              tions.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name of the filter as specified for a Describe* or simi-
                 lar operation.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter value, which can specify one or more  values  used
                 to narrow the returned results.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-records (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of records to include in the response. If more
          records exist than the  specified  MaxRecords  value,  a  pagination
          token  called  a  marker  is  included  in  the response so that the
          remaining results can be retrieved.

       --marker (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter  is  specified,  the response includes only records beyond
          the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          A pagination token returned for you to pass to a subsequent request.
          If  you pass this token as the Marker value in a subsequent request,
          the response includes only records beyond  the  marker,  up  to  the
          value specified in the request by MaxRecords .

       ReplicationTaskIndividualAssessments -> (list)
          One or more individual assessments as specified by Filters .

          (structure)
              Provides  information  that  describes  an individual assessment
              from a premigration assessment run.

              ReplicationTaskIndividualAssessmentArn -> (string)
                 Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this individual assessment.

              ReplicationTaskAssessmentRunArn -> (string)
                 ARN of the premigration assessment run that is created to run
                 this individual assessment.

              IndividualAssessmentName -> (string)
                 Name of this individual assessment.

              Status -> (string)
                 Individual assessment status.

                 This status can have one of the following values:

                 o "cancelled"

                 o "error"

                 o "failed"

                 o "passed"

                 o "pending"

                 o "running"

              ReplicationTaskIndividualAssessmentStartDate -> (timestamp)
                 Date  when  this individual assessment was started as part of
                 running the StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun operation.
