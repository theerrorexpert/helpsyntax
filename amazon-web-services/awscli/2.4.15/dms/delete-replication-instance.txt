DELETE-REPLICATION-INSTANCE()                    DELETE-REPLICATION-INSTANCE()



NAME
       delete-replication-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the specified replication instance.

       NOTE:
          You  must  delete  any  migration tasks that are associated with the
          replication instance before you can delete it.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-replication-instance
          --replication-instance-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --replication-instance-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  replication  instance  to  be
          deleted.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 available replication instance  classes,  see  Selecting  the
                 right DMS replication instance for your migration .

              AllocatedStorage -> (integer)
                 The  amount  of  storage (in gigabytes) that is allocated for
                 the replication instance.

              MultiAZ -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether the  replication  instance  is  a  Multi-AZ
                 deployment.  You  can't set the AvailabilityZone parameter if
                 the Multi-AZ parameter is set to true .

              EngineVersion -> (string)
                 The engine version number of the replication instance.

          MultiAZ -> (boolean)

              ment.  You  can't  set  the  AvailabilityZone  parameter  if the
              Multi-AZ parameter is set to true .

              If  you  don't  specify a value for the KmsKeyId parameter, then
              DMS uses your default encryption key.

              KMS creates the default encryption key for your Amazon Web  Ser-
              vices  account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different
              default encryption key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

              Specifies  the  accessibility  options   for   the   replication
              instance.  A  value of true represents an instance with a public
              IP address. A value of false represents an instance with a  pri-
              vate IP address. The default value is true .

          SecondaryAvailabilityZone -> (string)
              The  Availability  Zone of the standby replication instance in a
              Multi-AZ deployment.

          FreeUntil -> (timestamp)
              The expiration date of the free  replication  instance  that  is
              part of the Free DMS program.

          DnsNameServers -> (string)
