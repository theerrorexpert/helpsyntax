MODIFY-ENDPOINT()                                            MODIFY-ENDPOINT()



NAME
       modify-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies the specified endpoint.

       NOTE:
          For  a MySQL source or target endpoint, don't explicitly specify the
          database using the DatabaseName request parameter on the  ModifyEnd-
          point API call. Specifying DatabaseName when you modify a MySQL end-
          point replicates all the task tables to this  single  database.  For
          MySQL  endpoints, you specify the database only when you specify the
          schema in the table-mapping rules of the DMS task.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ServiceAccessRoleArn": "string"
          }

       --s3-settings (structure)
          Settings  in JSON format for the target Amazon S3 endpoint. For more
          information about  the  available  settings,  see  Extra  Connection
          Attributes  When Using Amazon S3 as a Target for DMS in the Database
          Migration Service User Guide.

          ServiceAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) used by the service to access the
              IAM  role.  The role must allow the iam:PassRole action. It is a
              required parameter that enables DMS to write  and  read  objects
              from an S3 bucket.

          ExternalTableDefinition -> (string)
              Specifies how tables are defined in the S3 source files only.

          CsvRowDelimiter -> (string)
              The  delimiter  used  to separate rows in the .csv file for both
              source and target. The default is a carriage return (\n ).

          CsvDelimiter -> (string)
              The delimiter used to separate columns in the .csv file for both
              source and target. The default is a comma.

          BucketFolder -> (string)
              An  optional parameter to set a folder name in the S3 bucket. If
              provided,  tables  are  created  in  the  path  ``  bucketFolder
              /schema_name  /table_name  /``  . If this parameter isn't speci-
              fied, then the path used is `` schema_name /table_name /`` .

          BucketName -> (string)
              The name of the S3 bucket.

          CompressionType -> (string)
              An optional parameter to use GZIP to compress the target  files.
              Set to GZIP to compress the target files. Either set this param-
              eter to NONE (the default) or don't use it to  leave  the  files
              uncompressed.  This  parameter applies to both .csv and .parquet
              file formats.

          EncryptionMode -> (string)
              The type of server-side encryption that you want to use for your
              data.  This  encryption type is part of the endpoint settings or
              the extra connections attributes for Amazon S3. You  can  choose
              either SSE_S3 (the default) or SSE_KMS .

              NOTE:
                 For the ModifyEndpoint operation, you can change the existing
                 value of the EncryptionMode parameter from SSE_KMS to  SSE_S3
                 .  But  you  cant  change  the  existing value from SSE_S3 to
                 SSE_KMS .

              To use SSE_S3 , you need an Identity and Access Management (IAM)
              role  with  permission  to allow "arn:aws:s3:::dms-*" to use the
              following actions:

              o s3:CreateBucket

              o s3:ListBucket

              o s3:DeleteBucket

              o s3:GetBucketLocation

              o s3:GetObject

              o s3:PutObject

              o s3:DeleteObject

              o s3:GetObjectVersion

              o s3:GetBucketPolicy

              o s3:PutBucketPolicy

              o s3:DeleteBucketPolicy

          ServerSideEncryptionKmsKeyId -> (string)
              If you are using SSE_KMS for the EncryptionMode  ,  provide  the
              KMS  key  ID. The key that you use needs an attached policy that
              enables Identity and Access Management  (IAM)  user  permissions
              and allows use of the key.

              Here is a CLI example:
              ``
              aws   dms  create-endpoint  --endpoint-identifier  value  --end-
              point-type target --engine-name s3 --s3-settings  ServiceAccess-
              RoleArn=*value*     ,BucketFolder=*value*    ,BucketName=*value*
              ,EncryptionMode=SSE_KMS,ServerSideEncryptionKmsKeyId=*value* ``

          DataFormat -> (string)
              The format of the data that you want to use for output. You  can
              choose one of the following:

              o csv  :  This  is  a row-based file format with comma-separated
                values (.csv).

              o parquet : Apache Parquet (.parquet) is a columnar storage file
                format that features efficient compression and provides faster
                query response.

          EncodingType -> (string)
              The type of encoding you are using:

              o RLE_DICTIONARY  uses  a   combination   of   bit-packing   and
                run-length encoding to store repeated values more efficiently.
                This is the default.

              o PLAIN doesn't use encoding at all. Values are stored  as  they
                are.

              o PLAIN_DICTIONARY builds a dictionary of the values encountered
                in a given column. The dictionary is stored  in  a  dictionary
                page for each column chunk.

          DictPageSizeLimit -> (integer)
              The  maximum  size of an encoded dictionary page of a column. If
              the dictionary page exceeds this, this column is stored using an
              encoding  type of PLAIN . This parameter defaults to 1024 * 1024
              bytes (1 MiB), the maximum size of a dictionary page  before  it
              reverts  to  PLAIN encoding. This size is used for .parquet file
              format only.

          RowGroupLength -> (integer)
              The number of rows in a row group. A smaller row group size pro-
              vides  faster  reads. But as the number of row groups grows, the
              slower writes become. This parameter defaults  to  10,000  rows.
              This number is used for .parquet file format only.

              If you choose a value larger than the maximum, RowGroupLength is
              set to the max row group length in bytes (64 * 1024 * 1024).

          DataPageSize -> (integer)
              The size of one data page in bytes. This parameter  defaults  to
              1024 * 1024 bytes (1 MiB). This number is used for .parquet file
              format only.

          ParquetVersion -> (string)
              The version of the Apache Parquet format that you want  to  use:
              parquet_1_0 (the default) or parquet_2_0 .

          EnableStatistics -> (boolean)
              A  value  that  enables  statistics  for  Parquet  pages and row
              groups. Choose true to enable statistics, false to disable. Sta-
              tistics  include  NULL  ,  DISTINCT , MAX , and MIN values. This
              parameter defaults to true . This value  is  used  for  .parquet
              file format only.

          IncludeOpForFullLoad -> (boolean)
              A  value  that enables a full load to write INSERT operations to
              the comma-separated value (.csv) output files only  to  indicate
              how the rows were added to the source database.

              NOTE:
                 DMS  supports  the IncludeOpForFullLoad parameter in versions
                 3.1.4 and later.

              For full load, records can only be  inserted.  By  default  (the
              false setting), no information is recorded in these output files
              for a full load to indicate that the rows were inserted  at  the
              source  database.  If IncludeOpForFullLoad is set to true or y ,
              the INSERT is recorded as an I annotation in the first field  of
              the  .csv  file.  This  allows the format of your target records
              from a full load to be consistent with the target records from a
              CDC load.

              NOTE:
                 This  setting  works together with the CdcInsertsOnly and the
                 CdcInsertsAndUpdates parameters  for  output  to  .csv  files
                 only.  For  more  information  about  how these settings work
                 together, see Indicating Source DB Operations in Migrated  S3
                 Data in the Database Migration Service User Guide. .

          CdcInsertsOnly -> (boolean)
              A  value  that enables a change data capture (CDC) load to write
              only INSERT operations to .csv or  columnar  storage  (.parquet)
              output files. By default (the false setting), the first field in
              a .csv or .parquet record contains  the  letter  I  (INSERT),  U
              (UPDATE),  or  D (DELETE). These values indicate whether the row
              was inserted, updated, or deleted at the source database  for  a
              CDC load to the target.

              If  CdcInsertsOnly  is  set to true or y , only INSERTs from the
              source database are migrated to the .csv or .parquet  file.  For
              .csv  format only, how these INSERTs are recorded depends on the
              value of IncludeOpForFullLoad . If IncludeOpForFullLoad  is  set
              to  true  ,  the  first field of every CDC record is set to I to
              indicate the INSERT operation at the source. If IncludeOpForFul-
              lLoad  is  set  to false , every CDC record is written without a
              first field to indicate the INSERT operation at the source.  For
              more  information  about  how  these settings work together, see
              Indicating Source DB Operations in Migrated S3 Data in the Data-
              base Migration Service User Guide. .

              NOTE:
                 DMS  supports the interaction described preceding between the
                 CdcInsertsOnly and IncludeOpForFullLoad  parameters  in  ver-
                 sions 3.1.4 and later.
                     CdcInsertsOnly and CdcInsertsAndUpdates can't both be set
                     to true for the same endpoint. Set either  CdcInsertsOnly
                     or  CdcInsertsAndUpdates  to  true for the same endpoint,
                     but not both.

          TimestampColumnName -> (string)
              A value that when nonblank causes DMS to add a column with time-
              stamp  information to the endpoint data for an Amazon S3 target.

              NOTE:
                 DMS supports the TimestampColumnName  parameter  in  versions
                 3.1.4 and later.

              DMS includes an additional STRING column in the .csv or .parquet
              object files of your migrated data when you set TimestampColumn-
              Name to a nonblank value.

              For  a  full  load, each row of this timestamp column contains a
              timestamp for when the data was transferred from the  source  to
              the target by DMS.

              For  a change data capture (CDC) load, each row of the timestamp
              column contains the timestamp for the commit of that row in  the
              source database.

              The  string format for this timestamp column value is yyyy-MM-dd
              HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS . By default, the precision of this value is  in
              microseconds.  For  a  CDC  load,  the rounding of the precision
              depends on the commit timestamp supported by DMS for the  source
              database.

              When  the  AddColumnName  parameter  is  set  to true , DMS also
              includes a name for the  timestamp  column  that  you  set  with
              TimestampColumnName .

          ParquetTimestampInMillisecond -> (boolean)
              A  value  that  specifies  the precision of any TIMESTAMP column
              values that are written to an Amazon S3 object file in  .parquet
              format.

              NOTE:
                 DMS  supports  the ParquetTimestampInMillisecond parameter in
                 versions 3.1.4 and later.

              When ParquetTimestampInMillisecond is set to true  or  y  ,  DMS
              writes  all  TIMESTAMP columns in a .parquet formatted file with
              millisecond precision. Otherwise, DMS writes them with microsec-
              ond precision.

              Currently,  Amazon  Athena  and Glue can handle only millisecond
              precision for TIMESTAMP values. Set this parameter to  true  for
              S3 endpoint object files that are .parquet formatted only if you
              plan to query or process the data with Athena or Glue.

              NOTE:
                 DMS writes any TIMESTAMP column values written to an S3  file
                 in .csv format with microsecond precision.

                 Setting  ParquetTimestampInMillisecond  has  no effect on the
                 string format of the timestamp column value that is  inserted
                 by setting the TimestampColumnName parameter.

          CdcInsertsAndUpdates -> (boolean)
              A  value  that enables a change data capture (CDC) load to write
              INSERT and UPDATE operations to .csv or .parquet (columnar stor-
              age)  output  files.  The  default  setting  is false , but when
              CdcInsertsAndUpdates is set to true or  y  ,  only  INSERTs  and
              UPDATEs  from  the  source  database are migrated to the .csv or
              .parquet file.

              For .csv file format only, how these  INSERTs  and  UPDATEs  are
              recorded depends on the value of the IncludeOpForFullLoad param-
              eter. If IncludeOpForFullLoad is set to true , the  first  field
              of  every  CDC record is set to either I or U to indicate INSERT
              and UPDATE operations at the source. But if IncludeOpForFullLoad
              is  set to false , CDC records are written without an indication
              of INSERT or UPDATE operations at the source. For more  informa-
              tion  about  how  these  settings  work together, see Indicating
              Source DB Operations in Migrated S3 Data in the Database  Migra-
              tion Service User Guide. .

              NOTE:
                 DMS supports the use of the CdcInsertsAndUpdates parameter in
                 versions 3.3.1 and later.
                     CdcInsertsOnly and CdcInsertsAndUpdates can't both be set
                     to  true for the same endpoint. Set either CdcInsertsOnly
                     or CdcInsertsAndUpdates to true for  the  same  endpoint,
                     but not both.

          DatePartitionEnabled -> (boolean)
              When  set  to true , this parameter partitions S3 bucket folders
              based on transaction commit dates. The default value is false  .
              For  more  information about date-based folder partitioning, see
              Using date-based folder partitioning .

          DatePartitionSequence -> (string)
              Identifies the sequence of the date format to use during  folder
              partitioning. The default value is YYYYMMDD . Use this parameter
              when DatePartitionedEnabled is set to true .

          DatePartitionDelimiter -> (string)
              Specifies a date separating delimiter to use during folder  par-
              titioning.  The default value is SLASH . Use this parameter when
              DatePartitionedEnabled is set to true .

          UseCsvNoSupValue -> (boolean)
              This setting applies if the S3 output files during a change data
              capture  (CDC)  load  are written in .csv format. If set to true
              for columns not included in the supplemental log, DMS  uses  the
              value         specified         by        `        CsvNoSupValue
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_S3Settings.html#DMS-Type-S3Settings-CsvNoSupValue`__
              . If not set or set to false , DMS uses the null value for these
              columns.

              NOTE:
                 This setting is supported in DMS versions 3.4.1 and later.

          CsvNoSupValue -> (string)
              This setting only applies if your Amazon S3 output files  during
              a  change data capture (CDC) load are written in .csv format. If
              `                                               UseCsvNoSupValue
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_S3Settings.html#DMS-Type-S3Settings-UseCsvNoSupValue`__
              is set to true, specify a string value that you want DMS to  use
              for  all columns not included in the supplemental log. If you do
              not specify a string value, DMS uses the null  value  for  these
              columns regardless of the UseCsvNoSupValue setting.

              NOTE:
                 This setting is supported in DMS versions 3.4.1 and later.

          PreserveTransactions -> (boolean)
              If  set  to  true , DMS saves the transaction order for a change
              data capture (CDC) load on the Amazon S3 target specified  by  `
              CdcPath
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_S3Settings.html#DMS-Type-S3Settings-CdcPath`__
              . For more information, see Capturing data changes (CDC) includ-
              ing transaction order on the S3 target .

              NOTE:
                 This setting is supported in DMS versions 3.4.2 and later.

          CdcPath -> (string)
              Specifies the folder path of CDC files. For an S3  source,  this
              setting  is  required if a task captures change data; otherwise,
              it's optional. If CdcPath is set, DMS reads CDC files from  this
              path and replicates the data changes to the target endpoint. For
              an   S3   target   if    you    set    `    PreserveTransactions
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_S3Settings.html#DMS-Type-S3Settings-PreserveTransactions`__
              to true , DMS verifies that you have set  this  parameter  to  a
              folder path on your S3 target where DMS can save the transaction
              order for the CDC load. DMS creates  this  CDC  folder  path  in
              either  your  S3 target working directory or the S3 target loca-
              tion         specified         by         `         BucketFolder
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_S3Settings.html#DMS-Type-S3Settings-BucketFolder`__
              and                         `                         BucketName
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_S3Settings.html#DMS-Type-S3Settings-BucketName`__
              .

              For example, if you specify CdcPath as MyChangedData ,  and  you
              specify  BucketName as MyTargetBucket but do not specify Bucket-
              Folder , DMS creates the CDC folder  path  following:  MyTarget-
              Bucket/MyChangedData .

              If  you specify the same CdcPath , and you specify BucketName as
              MyTargetBucket and BucketFolder as MyTargetData  ,  DMS  creates
              the   CDC   folder   path   following:  MyTargetBucket/MyTarget-
              Data/MyChangedData .

              For more information on CDC including transaction order on an S3
              target,  see  Capturing data changes (CDC) including transaction
              order on the S3 target .

              NOTE:
                 This setting is supported in DMS versions 3.4.2 and later.

          UseTaskStartTimeForFullLoadTimestamp -> (boolean)
              When set to true, this parameter uses the task start time as the
              timestamp  column  value  instead of the time data is written to
              target. For full load, when useTaskStartTimeForFullLoadTimestamp
              is  set  to true , each row of the timestamp column contains the
              task start time. For CDC loads, each row of the timestamp column
              contains the transaction commit time.

              When  useTaskStartTimeForFullLoadTimestamp is set to false , the
              full load timestamp in the timestamp column increments with  the
              time data arrives at the target.

          CannedAclForObjects -> (string)
              A value that enables DMS to specify a predefined (canned) access
              control list for objects created in an Amazon S3 bucket as  .csv
              or  .parquet  files. For more information about Amazon S3 canned
              ACLs, see Canned ACL in the Amazon S3 Developer Guide.

              The default value is NONE. Valid values include  NONE,  PRIVATE,
              PUBLIC_READ,        PUBLIC_READ_WRITE,       AUTHENTICATED_READ,
              AWS_EXEC_READ, BUCKET_OWNER_READ, and BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL.

          AddColumnName -> (boolean)
              An  optional parameter that, when set to true or y , you can use
              to add column name information to the .csv output file.

              The default value is false . Valid values are true , false , y ,
              and n .

          CdcMaxBatchInterval -> (integer)
              Maximum  length of the interval, defined in seconds, after which
              to output a file to Amazon S3.

              When CdcMaxBatchInterval and CdcMinFileSize are both  specified,
              the  file write is triggered by whichever parameter condition is
              met first within an DMS CloudFormation template.

              The default value is 60 seconds.

          CdcMinFileSize -> (integer)
              Minimum file size, defined in megabytes, to  reach  for  a  file
              output to Amazon S3.

              When  CdcMinFileSize and CdcMaxBatchInterval are both specified,
              the file write is triggered by whichever parameter condition  is
              met first within an DMS CloudFormation template.

              The default value is 32 MB.

          CsvNullValue -> (string)
              An optional parameter that specifies how DMS treats null values.
              While handling the null value, you can  use  this  parameter  to
              pass  a  user-defined string as null when writing to the target.
              For example, when target columns are not nullable, you  can  use
              this  option to differentiate between the empty string value and
              the null value. So, if you set this parameter value to the empty
              string ("" or ''), DMS treats the empty string as the null value
              instead of NULL .

              The default value is NULL  .  Valid  values  include  any  valid
              string.

          IgnoreHeaderRows -> (integer)
              When this value is set to 1, DMS ignores the first row header in
              a .csv file. A value of 1 turns on the feature;  a  value  of  0
              turns off the feature.

              The default is 0.

          MaxFileSize -> (integer)
              A value that specifies the maximum size (in KB) of any .csv file
              to be created while migrating to an S3 target during full  load.

              The default value is 1,048,576 KB (1 GB). Valid values include 1
              to 1,048,576.

          Rfc4180 -> (boolean)
              For an S3 source, when this value is set to true  or  y  ,  each
              leading  double  quotation  mark has to be followed by an ending
              double quotation mark. This formatting complies with  RFC  4180.
              When  this  value  is  set  to  false or n , string literals are
              copied to the target as is. In this case, a  delimiter  (row  or
              column)  signals  the  end  of  the field. Thus, you can't use a
              delimiter as part of the string, because it signals the  end  of
              the value.

              For  an S3 target, an optional parameter used to set behavior to
              comply with RFC 4180 for data migrated to Amazon S3  using  .csv
              file format only. When this value is set to true or y using Ama-
              zon S3 as a target, if the data has quotation marks  or  newline
              characters  in  it, DMS encloses the entire column with an addi-
              tional pair of double quotation marks ("). Every quotation  mark
              within the data is repeated twice.

              The  default value is true . Valid values include true , false ,
              y , and n .

          DatePartitionTimezone -> (string)
              When creating an S3 target endpoint,  set  DatePartitionTimezone
              to  convert the current UTC time into a specified time zone. The
              conversion occurs when a date partition folder is created and  a
              CDC  filename  is  generated. The time zone format is Area/Loca-
              tion. Use this parameter when DatePartitionedEnabled is  set  to
              true , as shown in the following example.
                 s3-settings='{"DatePartitionEnabled": true, "DatePartitionSe-
                 quence":  "YYYYMMDDHH",  "DatePartitionDelimiter":   "SLASH",

              not used and can be empty.

          AuthMechanism -> (string)
              The  authentication  mechanism  you  use  to  access the MongoDB
              source endpoint.

              For the default value, in  MongoDB  version  2.x,  "default"  is
              "mongodb_cr"  .  For  MongoDB version 3.x or later, "default" is
              "scram_sha_1" . This setting isn't used when AuthType is set  to
              "no" .

              The  KMS  key  identifier that is used to encrypt the content on
              the replication instance. If you don't specify a value  for  the
              KmsKeyId  parameter,  then DMS uses your default encryption key.
              KMS creates the default encryption key for your Amazon Web  Ser-
              vices  account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different
              default encryption key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

              The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that  speci-
              fies  DMS  as the trusted entity and grants the required permis-
              sions to access the value in  SecretsManagerSecret  .  The  role
              must allow the iam:PassRole action. SecretsManagerSecret has the
              value of the Amazon Web Services  Secrets  Manager  secret  that
              allows access to the MongoDB endpoint.

              NOTE:
                 You  can  specify one of two sets of values for these permis-
                 sions. You can  specify  the  values  for  this  setting  and
                 SecretsManagerSecretId . Or you can specify clear-text values
                 for UserName , Password , ServerName , and Port .  You  can't
                 specify  both. For more information on creating this Secrets-
                 ManagerSecret   and   the   SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn   and
                 SecretsManagerSecretId  required  to  access  it,  see  Using
                 secrets to access Database Migration Service resources in the
                 Database Migration Service User Guide .

          SecretsManagerSecretId -> (string)
              The  full  ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of the SecretsMan-
              agerSecret  that  contains  the  MongoDB   endpoint   connection
              details.

       --kinesis-settings (structure)
          Settings  in  JSON format for the target endpoint for Amazon Kinesis
          Data Streams. For more information about the available settings, see
          Using object mapping to migrate data to a Kinesis data stream in the
          Database Migration Service User Guide.

          StreamArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  for  the  Amazon  Kinesis  Data
              Streams endpoint.

          MessageFormat -> (string)
              The  output  format for the records created on the endpoint. The
              message format is JSON (default) or JSON_UNFORMATTED  (a  single
              line with no tab).

          ServiceAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the IAM role that DMS uses to
              write to the Kinesis  data  stream.  The  role  must  allow  the
              iam:PassRole action.

          IncludeTransactionDetails -> (boolean)
              Provides  detailed transaction information from the source data-
              base. This information includes a commit timestamp, a log  posi-
              tion,  and values for transaction_id , previous transaction_id ,
              and transaction_record_id (the record offset within  a  transac-
              tion). The default is false .

          IncludePartitionValue -> (boolean)
              Shows  the  partition  value  within the Kinesis message output,
              unless the partition type is schema-table-type . The default  is
              false .

          PartitionIncludeSchemaTable -> (boolean)
              Prefixes  schema  and  table names to partition values, when the
              partition type is primary-key-type . Doing this  increases  data
              distribution  among  Kinesis shards. For example, suppose that a
              SysBench schema has thousands of tables and each table has  only
              limited  range for a primary key. In this case, the same primary
              key is sent from thousands of tables to the  same  shard,  which
              causes throttling. The default is false .

          IncludeTableAlterOperations -> (boolean)
              Includes  any  data  definition  language  (DDL) operations that
              change the table in the control data,  such  as  rename-table  ,
              drop-table  , add-column , drop-column , and rename-column . The
              default is false .

          IncludeControlDetails -> (boolean)
              Shows detailed control information for table definition,  column
              definition,  and table and column changes in the Kinesis message
              output. The default is false .

          IncludeNullAndEmpty -> (boolean)
              Include NULL and empty columns for records migrated to the  end-
              point. The default is false .

          NoHexPrefix -> (boolean)
              Set  this optional parameter to true to avoid adding a '0x' pre-
              fix to raw data in hexadecimal format. For example, by  default,
              DMS  adds  a  '0x'  prefix to the LOB column type in hexadecimal
              format moving from an Oracle source to an Amazon Kinesis target.
              Use  the NoHexPrefix endpoint setting to enable migration of RAW
              data type columns without adding the '0x' prefix.

       --kafka-settings (structure)
          Settings in JSON format for the target Apache  Kafka  endpoint.  For
          more information about the available settings, see Using object map-
          ping to migrate data to a Kafka topic in the Database Migration Ser-
          vice User Guide.

          Broker -> (string)
              A  comma-separated  list of one or more broker locations in your
              Kafka cluster that host your Kafka instance. Specify each broker
              location  in  the  form  `` broker-hostname-or-ip :port `` . For

              locations, see Using Apache  Kafka  as  a  target  for  Database
              Migration Service in the Database Migration Service User Guide .

          Topic -> (string)
              The topic to which you migrate the data. If you don't specify  a
              topic,  DMS  specifies  "kafka-default-topic"  as  the migration
              topic.

          MessageFormat -> (string)
              The output format for the records created on the  endpoint.  The
              message  format  is JSON (default) or JSON_UNFORMATTED (a single

              tion, and values for transaction_id , previous transaction_id  ,
              and  transaction_record_id  (the record offset within a transac-
              tion). The default is false .

          IncludePartitionValue -> (boolean)
              Shows the partition value within the Kafka message output unless
              the partition type is schema-table-type . The default is false .

          PartitionIncludeSchemaTable -> (boolean)
              Prefixes schema and table names to partition  values,  when  the
              partition  type  is primary-key-type . Doing this increases data
              distribution among Kafka partitions. For example, suppose that a
              SysBench  schema has thousands of tables and each table has only
              limited range for a primary key. In this case, the same  primary
              key  is  sent  from  thousands  of tables to the same partition,
              which causes throttling. The default is false .

          IncludeTableAlterOperations -> (boolean)
              Includes any data  definition  language  (DDL)  operations  that
              change  the  table  in  the control data, such as rename-table ,
              drop-table , add-column , drop-column , and rename-column .  The
              default is false .

          IncludeControlDetails -> (boolean)
              Shows  detailed control information for table definition, column
              definition, and table and column changes in  the  Kafka  message
              output. The default is false .

          MessageMaxBytes -> (integer)
              The  maximum  size  in bytes for records created on the endpoint
              The default is 1,000,000.

          IncludeNullAndEmpty -> (boolean)

              name and SaslPassword .

          SslClientCertificateArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the client certificate used to
              securely connect to a Kafka target endpoint.

          SslClientKeyArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) for the client private key used

              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  for  the private certificate
              authority (CA) cert that DMS uses to securely  connect  to  your
              Kafka target endpoint.

          SaslUsername -> (string)
              The  secure user name you created when you first set up your MSK
              cluster to validate a client identity and make an encrypted con-

              cluster to validate a client identity and make an encrypted con-
              nection between server and client using SASL-SSL authentication.

          NoHexPrefix -> (boolean)
              Set  this optional parameter to true to avoid adding a '0x' pre-
              fix to raw data in hexadecimal format. For example, by  default,
              DMS  adds  a  '0x'  prefix to the LOB column type in hexadecimal
              format moving from an Oracle source to a Kafka target.  Use  the

          EndpointUri -> (string)
              The endpoint for the OpenSearch cluster. DMS  uses  HTTPS  if  a
              transport protocol (http/https) is not specified.

          FullLoadErrorPercentage -> (integer)
              The  maximum  percentage  of records that can fail to be written
              before a full load operation stops.

              To avoid early failure, this counter  is  only  effective  after
              1000 records are transferred. OpenSearch also has the concept of
              error monitoring during the last 10 minutes  of  an  Observation
              Window.  If transfer of all records fail in the last 10 minutes,
              the full load operation stops.

          ErrorRetryDuration -> (integer)
              The maximum number of seconds for which DMS retries  failed  API
              requests to the OpenSearch cluster.

              Service  Role  for  Accessing  Amazon Neptune as a Target in the
              Database Migration Service User Guide.

          S3BucketName -> (string)
              The name of the Amazon S3 bucket where DMS can temporarily store
              migrated  graph data in .csv files before bulk-loading it to the
              Neptune target database. DMS maps the SQL source data  to  graph
              data before storing it in these .csv files.

          S3BucketFolder -> (string)
              A folder path where you want DMS to store migrated graph data in
              the S3 bucket specified by S3BucketName

          ErrorRetryDuration -> (integer)
              The number of milliseconds for DMS to wait to retry a  bulk-load
              of  migrated  graph  data  to the Neptune target database before

          MaxFileSize -> (integer)
              The maximum size in kilobytes of migrated graph data stored in a
              .csv  file  before DMS bulk-loads the data to the Neptune target
              database. The default is 1,048,576 KB. If the bulk load is  suc-
              cessful, DMS clears the bucket, ready to store the next batch of
              migrated graph data.

          MaxRetryCount -> (integer)
              The number of times for DMS to retry a  bulk  load  of  migrated
              graph  data  to  the  Neptune  target database before raising an
              error. The default is 5.

          IamAuthEnabled -> (boolean)
              If you want Identity and Access Management  (IAM)  authorization
              enabled  for  this  endpoint,  set this parameter to true . Then
              attach the appropriate IAM policy document to your service  role
              specified by ServiceAccessRoleArn . The default is false .

       Shorthand Syntax:

       --redshift-settings (structure)
          Provides information that defines an Amazon Redshift endpoint.

          AcceptAnyDate -> (boolean)
              A  value  that  indicates  to  allow  any date format, including
              invalid formats such as 00/00/00 00:00:00, to be loaded  without
              generating an error. You can choose true or false (the default).

              This parameter applies  only  to  TIMESTAMP  and  DATE  columns.
              Always  use  ACCEPTANYDATE with the DATEFORMAT parameter. If the
              date format for the data doesn't match the DATEFORMAT specifica-
              tion, Amazon Redshift inserts a NULL value into that field.

          AfterConnectScript -> (string)
              Code  to run after connecting. This parameter should contain the
              code itself, not the name of a file containing the code.

          BucketFolder -> (string)
              An S3 folder where the comma-separated-value  (.csv)  files  are
              stored before being uploaded to the target Redshift cluster.

              For  full load mode, DMS converts source records into .csv files
              and loads them to the BucketFolder/TableID path.  DMS  uses  the
              Redshift COPY command to upload the .csv files to the target ta-
              ble. The files are deleted once the COPY operation has finished.
              For  more  information, see COPY in the Amazon Redshift Database
              Developer Guide .

              For change-data-capture (CDC) mode, DMS creates a NetChanges ta-
              ble,    and    loads    the   .csv   files   to   this   Bucket-
              Folder/NetChangesTableID path.

          BucketName -> (string)
              The name of the intermediate S3 bucket used to store .csv  files
              before uploading data to Redshift.

          CaseSensitiveNames -> (boolean)
              If  Amazon  Redshift  is  configured  to  support case sensitive
              schema names, set CaseSensitiveNames to true .  The  default  is
              false .

          CompUpdate -> (boolean)
              If  you set CompUpdate to true Amazon Redshift applies automatic
              compression if the table is empty. This applies even if the  ta-
              ble  columns  already have encodings other than RAW . If you set
              CompUpdate to false ,  automatic  compression  is  disabled  and
              existing  column encodings aren't changed. The default is true .

          ConnectionTimeout -> (integer)
              A value that sets the amount of time to wait  (in  milliseconds)
              before timing out, beginning from when you initially establish a
              connection.

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              The name of the Amazon Redshift data  warehouse  (service)  that
              you are working with.

          DateFormat -> (string)
              The  date  format  that  you  are  using.  Valid values are auto
              (case-sensitive), your date format string enclosed in quotes, or
              NULL.  If  this parameter is left unset (NULL), it defaults to a
              format of 'YYYY-MM-DD'. Using auto recognizes most strings, even
              some that aren't supported when you use a date format string.

              If  your  date  and  time values use formats different from each
              other, set this to auto .

          EmptyAsNull -> (boolean)
              A value that specifies whether DMS should migrate empty CHAR and
              VARCHAR fields as NULL. A value of true sets empty CHAR and VAR-
              CHAR fields to null. The default is false .

          EncryptionMode -> (string)
              The type of server-side encryption that you want to use for your
              data.  This  encryption type is part of the endpoint settings or
              the extra connections attributes for Amazon S3. You  can  choose
              either SSE_S3 (the default) or SSE_KMS .

              NOTE:
                 For the ModifyEndpoint operation, you can change the existing
                 value of the EncryptionMode parameter from SSE_KMS to  SSE_S3
                 .  But  you  cant  change  the  existing value from SSE_S3 to
                 SSE_KMS .

              To use SSE_S3 , create an Identity and Access  Management  (IAM)
              role  with a policy that allows "arn:aws:s3:::*" to use the fol-
              lowing actions: "s3:PutObject", "s3:ListBucket"

          ExplicitIds -> (boolean)
              This setting is only valid for a full-load migration  task.  Set
              ExplicitIds  to  true to have tables with IDENTITY columns over-
              ride their auto-generated values  with  explicit  values  loaded
              from  the  source  data  files  used to populate the tables. The
              default is false .

          FileTransferUploadStreams -> (integer)
              The number of threads used to upload a single file. This parame-
              ter accepts a value from 1 through 64. It defaults to 10.

              The number of parallel streams used to upload a single .csv file
              to an S3 bucket using S3 Multipart Upload. For more information,
              see Multipart upload overview .
                 FileTransferUploadStreams  accepts a value from 1 through 64.
                 It defaults to 10.

          LoadTimeout -> (integer)
              The amount of time to wait (in milliseconds) before  timing  out
              of  operations  performed  by DMS on a Redshift cluster, such as
              Redshift COPY, INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE.

          MaxFileSize -> (integer)
              The maximum size (in KB) of any .csv file used to load  data  on
              an  S3  bucket and transfer data to Amazon Redshift. It defaults
              to 1048576KB (1 GB).

          Password -> (string)
              The password for the user named in the username property.

          Port -> (integer)
              The port number for Amazon Redshift. The default value is  5439.

          RemoveQuotes -> (boolean)
              A  value  that  specifies  to remove surrounding quotation marks
              from strings in the incoming data.  All  characters  within  the
              quotation marks, including delimiters, are retained. Choose true
              to remove quotation marks. The default is false .

          ReplaceInvalidChars -> (string)
              A list  of  characters  that  you  want  to  replace.  Use  with
              ReplaceChars .

          ReplaceChars -> (string)
              A value that specifies to replaces the invalid characters speci-
              fied in ReplaceInvalidChars , substituting the specified charac-
              ters instead. The default is "?" .

          ServerName -> (string)
              The name of the Amazon Redshift cluster you are using.

          ServiceAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that has access
              to  the  Amazon  Redshift  service.  The  role  must  allow  the
              iam:PassRole action.

          ServerSideEncryptionKmsKeyId -> (string)
              The  KMS key ID. If you are using SSE_KMS for the EncryptionMode
              , provide this key ID. The key that you use  needs  an  attached
              policy  that  enables IAM user permissions and allows use of the
              key.

          TimeFormat -> (string)
              The time format that you want to  use.  Valid  values  are  auto
              (case-sensitive),   'timeformat_string'   ,   'epochsecs'  ,  or
              'epochmillisecs' . It defaults to 10. Using auto recognizes most
              strings,  even  some  that  aren't supported when you use a time
              format string.

              If your date and time values use  formats  different  from  each
              other, set this parameter to auto .

          TrimBlanks -> (boolean)
              A  value that specifies to remove the trailing white space char-
              acters from a VARCHAR string. This  parameter  applies  only  to
              columns with a VARCHAR data type. Choose true to remove unneeded
              white space. The default is false .

          TruncateColumns -> (boolean)
              A value that specifies to truncate data in columns to the appro-
              priate  number  of characters, so that the data fits in the col-
              umn. This parameter applies only to columns with  a  VARCHAR  or
              CHAR  data  type,  and  rows with a size of 4 MB or less. Choose
              true to truncate data. The default is false .

          Username -> (string)
              An Amazon Redshift user name for a registered user.

          WriteBufferSize -> (integer)
              The size (in KB) of the in-memory file write  buffer  used  when
              generating  .csv  files on the local disk at the DMS replication
              instance. The default value is 1000 (buffer size is 1000KB).

          SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that  speci-
              fies  DMS  as the trusted entity and grants the required permis-
              sions to access the value in  SecretsManagerSecret  .  The  role
              must allow the iam:PassRole action. SecretsManagerSecret has the
              value of the Amazon Web Services  Secrets  Manager  secret  that
              allows access to the Amazon Redshift endpoint.

              NOTE:
                 You  can  specify one of two sets of values for these permis-
                 sions. You can  specify  the  values  for  this  setting  and
                 SecretsManagerSecretId . Or you can specify clear-text values
                 for UserName , Password , ServerName , and Port .  You  can't
                 specify  both. For more information on creating this Secrets-
                 ManagerSecret   and   the   SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn   and
                 SecretsManagerSecretId  required  to  access  it,  see  Using
                 secrets to access Database Migration Service resources in the
                 Database Migration Service User Guide .

          SecretsManagerSecretId -> (string)
              The  full  ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of the SecretsMan-
              agerSecret that contains the Amazon Redshift endpoint connection
              details.

       --postgre-sql-settings (structure)
          Settings  in  JSON  format for the source and target PostgreSQL end-
          point. For information about other  available  settings,  see  Extra
          connection  attributes when using PostgreSQL as a source for DMS and
          Extra connection attributes when using PostgreSQL as  a  target  for
          DMS in the Database Migration Service User Guide.

          AfterConnectScript -> (string)
              For  use with change data capture (CDC) only, this attribute has
              DMS bypass foreign keys and user triggers to reduce the time  it
              takes to bulk load data.

              Example:         afterConnectScript=SET         session_replica-
              tion_role='replica'

          CaptureDdls -> (boolean)
              To capture DDL events, DMS  creates  various  artifacts  in  the
              PostgreSQL  database  when the task starts. You can later remove
              these artifacts.

              If this value is set to N , you don't have to create  tables  or
              triggers on the source database.

          MaxFileSize -> (integer)
              Specifies  the  maximum  size  (in  KB) of any .csv file used to
              transfer data to PostgreSQL.

              Example: maxFileSize=512

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              Database name for the endpoint.

          DdlArtifactsSchema -> (string)
              The schema in which the operational DDL database  artifacts  are
              created.

              Example: ddlArtifactsSchema=xyzddlschema;

          ExecuteTimeout -> (integer)
              Sets  the  client statement timeout for the PostgreSQL instance,
              in seconds. The default value is 60 seconds.

              Example: executeTimeout=100;

          FailTasksOnLobTruncation -> (boolean)
              When set to true , this value causes  a  task  to  fail  if  the
              actual  size  of a LOB column is greater than the specified Lob-
              MaxSize .

              If task is set to Limited LOB mode and this  option  is  set  to
              true, the task fails instead of truncating the LOB data.

          HeartbeatEnable -> (boolean)
              The  write-ahead  log  (WAL)  heartbeat  feature  mimics a dummy
              transaction. By doing this, it prevents idle logical replication
              slots  from holding onto old WAL logs, which can result in stor-
              age  full  situations  on  the  source.  This  heartbeat   keeps
              restart_lsn moving and prevents storage full scenarios.

          HeartbeatSchema -> (string)
              Sets the schema in which the heartbeat artifacts are created.

          HeartbeatFrequency -> (integer)
              Sets the WAL heartbeat frequency (in minutes).

          Password -> (string)
              Endpoint connection password.

          Port -> (integer)
              Endpoint TCP port. The default is 5432.

          ServerName -> (string)
              Fully qualified domain name of the endpoint.

          Username -> (string)
              Endpoint connection user name.

          SlotName -> (string)
              Sets  the  name of a previously created logical replication slot
              for a change data capture (CDC) load of  the  PostgreSQL  source
              instance.

              When  used  with  the CdcStartPosition request parameter for the
              DMS API , this attribute also makes it possible  to  use  native
              CDC start points. DMS verifies that the specified logical repli-
              cation slot exists before starting the CDC load  task.  It  also
              verifies  that the task was created with a valid setting of Cdc-
              StartPosition . If the specified slot doesn't exist or the  task
              doesn't  have  a  valid  CdcStartPosition setting, DMS raises an
              error.

              For more information about setting the CdcStartPosition  request
              parameter, see Determining a CDC native start point in the Data-
              base Migration Service User Guide . For more  information  about
              using    CdcStartPosition    ,   see   CreateReplicationTask   ,
              StartReplicationTask , and ModifyReplicationTask .

          PluginName -> (string)
              Specifies the plugin to use to create a replication slot.

          SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that  speci-
              fies  DMS  as the trusted entity and grants the required permis-
              sions to access the value in  SecretsManagerSecret  .  The  role
              must allow the iam:PassRole action. SecretsManagerSecret has the
              value of the Amazon Web Services  Secrets  Manager  secret  that
              allows access to the PostgreSQL endpoint.

              NOTE:
                 You  can  specify one of two sets of values for these permis-
                 sions. You can  specify  the  values  for  this  setting  and
                 SecretsManagerSecretId . Or you can specify clear-text values
                 for UserName , Password , ServerName , and Port .  You  can't
                 specify  both. For more information on creating this Secrets-
                 ManagerSecret   and   the   SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn   and
                 SecretsManagerSecretId  required  to  access  it,  see  Using
                 secrets to access Database Migration Service resources in the
                 Database Migration Service User Guide .

          SecretsManagerSecretId -> (string)
              The  full  ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of the SecretsMan-
              agerSecret that  contains  the  PostgreSQL  endpoint  connection
              details.

       --my-sql-settings (structure)
          Settings  in  JSON  format for the source and target MySQL endpoint.
          For information about other available settings, see Extra connection
          attributes when using MySQL as a source for DMS and Extra connection
          attributes when using a MySQL-compatible database as  a  target  for
          DMS in the Database Migration Service User Guide.

          AfterConnectScript -> (string)
              Specifies  a script to run immediately after DMS connects to the
              endpoint. The migration task continues running regardless if the
              SQL statement succeeds or fails.

              For  this  parameter, provide the code of the script itself, not
              the name of a file containing the script.

          CleanSourceMetadataOnMismatch -> (boolean)
              Adjusts the behavior of DMS when migrating from  an  SQL  Server
              source  database  that  is hosted as part of an Always On avail-
              ability group cluster. If you need DMS to poll all the nodes  in
              the   Always  On  cluster  for  transaction  backups,  set  this
              attribute to false .

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              Database name for the endpoint. For a  MySQL  source  or  target
              endpoint,  don't  explicitly  specify  the  database  using  the
              DatabaseName request parameter on either the  CreateEndpoint  or
              ModifyEndpoint API call. Specifying DatabaseName when you create
              or modify a MySQL endpoint replicates all  the  task  tables  to
              this single database. For MySQL endpoints, you specify the data-
              base only when you specify the schema in the table-mapping rules
              of the DMS task.

          EventsPollInterval -> (integer)
              Specifies   how   often   to   check  the  binary  log  for  new
              changes/events when the database is idle. The  default  is  five
              seconds.

              Example: eventsPollInterval=5;

              In  the example, DMS checks for changes in the binary logs every
              five seconds.

          TargetDbType -> (string)
              Specifies where to migrate source tables on the  target,  either
              to a single database or multiple databases.

              Example: targetDbType=MULTIPLE_DATABASES

          MaxFileSize -> (integer)
              Specifies  the  maximum  size  (in  KB) of any .csv file used to
              transfer data to a MySQL-compatible database.

              Example: maxFileSize=512

          ParallelLoadThreads -> (integer)
              Improves performance when loading data into the MySQL-compatible
              target  database.  Specifies how many threads to use to load the
              data into the MySQL-compatible target database. Setting a  large
              number of threads can have an adverse effect on database perfor-
              mance, because  a  separate  connection  is  required  for  each
              thread. The default is one.

              Example: parallelLoadThreads=1

          Password -> (string)
              Endpoint connection password.

          Port -> (integer)
              Endpoint TCP port.

          ServerName -> (string)
              Fully qualified domain name of the endpoint.

          ServerTimezone -> (string)
              Specifies the time zone for the source MySQL database.

              Example: serverTimezone=US/Pacific;

              Note: Do not enclose time zones in single quotes.

          Username -> (string)
              Endpoint connection user name.

          SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The  full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that speci-
              fies DMS as the trusted entity and grants the  required  permis-
              sions  to  access  the  value in SecretsManagerSecret . The role
              must allow the iam:PassRole action. SecretsManagerSecret has the
              value  of  the  Amazon  Web Services Secrets Manager secret that
              allows access to the MySQL endpoint.

              NOTE:
                 You can specify one of two sets of values for  these  permis-
                 sions.  You  can  specify  the  values  for  this setting and
                 SecretsManagerSecretId . Or you can specify clear-text values
                 for  UserName  , Password , ServerName , and Port . You can't
                 specify both. For more information on creating this  Secrets-
                 ManagerSecret   and   the   SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn   and
                 SecretsManagerSecretId  required  to  access  it,  see  Using
                 secrets to access Database Migration Service resources in the
                 Database Migration Service User Guide .

          SecretsManagerSecretId -> (string)
              The full ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of  the  SecretsMan-
              agerSecret  that contains the MySQL endpoint connection details.

       --oracle-settings (structure)
          Settings in JSON format for the source and target  Oracle  endpoint.
          For information about other available settings, see Extra connection
          attributes when using Oracle as a source for DMS and  Extra  connec-
          tion  attributes  when using Oracle as a target for DMS in the Data-
          base Migration Service User Guide.

          AddSupplementalLogging -> (boolean)
              Set this attribute to set up  table-level  supplemental  logging
              for the Oracle database. This attribute enables PRIMARY KEY sup-
              plemental logging on all tables selected for a migration task.

              If you use this option, you still need to enable  database-level
              supplemental logging.

          ArchivedLogDestId -> (integer)
              Specifies  the ID of the destination for the archived redo logs.
              This value should be the same as a number in the dest_id  column
              of  the v$archived_log view. If you work with an additional redo
              log destination, use the AdditionalArchivedLogDestId  option  to
              specify  the additional destination ID. Doing this improves per-
              formance by ensuring that the correct logs are accessed from the
              outset.

          AdditionalArchivedLogDestId -> (integer)
              Set  this attribute with ArchivedLogDestId in a primary/ standby
              setup. This attribute is useful in the case of a switchover.  In
              this  case,  DMS  needs to know which destination to get archive
              redo logs from to read changes. This  need  arises  because  the
              previous  primary  instance  is  now  a  standby  instance after
              switchover.

              Although DMS supports the use of the Oracle RESETLOGS option  to
              open  the  database,  never  use RESETLOGS unless necessary. For
              additional information about RESETLOGS , see  RMAN  Data  Repair
              Concepts in the Oracle Database Backup and Recovery User's Guide
              .

          ExtraArchivedLogDestIds -> (list)
              Specifies the IDs of one  more  destinations  for  one  or  more
              archived redo logs. These IDs are the values of the dest_id col-
              umn in the  v$archived_log  view.  Use  this  setting  with  the
              archivedLogDestId   extra   connection   attribute   in  a  pri-
              mary-to-single setup or a primary-to-multiple-standby setup.

              This setting is useful in a switchover when you  use  an  Oracle
              Data  Guard database as a source. In this case, DMS needs infor-
              mation about what destination to get archive redo logs  from  to
              read  changes.  DMS  needs this because after the switchover the
              previous primary is a standby instance. For example, in  a  pri-
              mary-to-single  standby setup you might apply the following set-
              tings.
                 archivedLogDestId=1; ExtraArchivedLogDestIds=[2]

              In a primary-to-multiple-standby setup, you might apply the fol-
              lowing settings.
                 archivedLogDestId=1; ExtraArchivedLogDestIds=[2,3,4]

              Although  DMS supports the use of the Oracle RESETLOGS option to
              open the database, never use RESETLOGS  unless  it's  necessary.
              For more information about RESETLOGS , see RMAN Data Repair Con-
              cepts in the Oracle Database Backup and Recovery User's Guide  .

              (integer)

          AllowSelectNestedTables -> (boolean)
              Set  this  attribute  to  true  to  enable replication of Oracle
              tables containing columns that  are  nested  tables  or  defined
              types.

          ParallelAsmReadThreads -> (integer)
              Set this attribute to change the number of threads that DMS con-
              figures to perform a change data capture (CDC) load using Oracle
              Automatic  Storage  Management (ASM). You can specify an integer
              value between 2 (the default) and  8  (the  maximum).  Use  this
              attribute together with the readAheadBlocks attribute.

          ReadAheadBlocks -> (integer)
              Set  this  attribute  to  change the number of read-ahead blocks
              that DMS configures to perform a change data capture (CDC)  load
              using Oracle Automatic Storage Management (ASM). You can specify
              an integer value between 1000 (the  default)  and  200,000  (the
              maximum).

          AccessAlternateDirectly -> (boolean)
              Set this attribute to false in order to use the Binary Reader to
              capture change data for an Amazon RDS for Oracle as the  source.
              This  tells the DMS instance to not access redo logs through any
              specified path prefix replacement using direct file access.

          UseAlternateFolderForOnline -> (boolean)
              Set this attribute to true in order to use the Binary Reader  to
              capture  change data for an Amazon RDS for Oracle as the source.
              This tells the DMS instance to use any specified prefix replace-
              ment to access all online redo logs.

          OraclePathPrefix -> (string)
              Set  this string attribute to the required value in order to use
              the Binary Reader to capture change data for an Amazon  RDS  for
              Oracle  as  the  source. This value specifies the default Oracle
              root used to access the redo logs.

          UsePathPrefix -> (string)
              Set this string attribute to the required value in order to  use
              the  Binary  Reader to capture change data for an Amazon RDS for
              Oracle as the source. This value specifies the path prefix  used
              to replace the default Oracle root to access the redo logs.

          ReplacePathPrefix -> (boolean)
              Set  this attribute to true in order to use the Binary Reader to
              capture change data for an Amazon RDS for Oracle as the  source.
              This  setting  tells  DMS instance to replace the default Oracle
              root with the specified usePathPrefix setting to access the redo
              logs.

          EnableHomogenousTablespace -> (boolean)
              Set  this  attribute to enable homogenous tablespace replication
              and create existing tables or indexes under the same  tablespace
              on the target.

          DirectPathNoLog -> (boolean)
              When  set  to true , this attribute helps to increase the commit
              rate on the Oracle target database by writing directly to tables
              and not writing a trail to database logs.

          ArchivedLogsOnly -> (boolean)
              When  this  field  is  set to Y , DMS only accesses the archived
              redo logs. If the archived redo logs are stored  on  Oracle  ASM
              only, the DMS user account needs to be granted ASM privileges.

          AsmPassword -> (string)
              For  an  Oracle  source  endpoint, your Oracle Automatic Storage
              Management (ASM) password. You can set this value  from  the  ``
              asm_user_password  ``  value.  You set this value as part of the
              comma-separated value that  you  set  to  the  Password  request
              parameter  when  you  create  the endpoint to access transaction
              logs  using   Binary   Reader.   For   more   information,   see
              Configuration  for change data capture (CDC) on an Oracle source
              database .

          AsmServer -> (string)
              For an Oracle source endpoint, your ASM server address. You  can
              set  this value from the asm_server value. You set asm_server as
              part of the extra connection attribute string to access an  Ora-
              cle  server  with Binary Reader that uses ASM. For more informa-
              tion, see Configuration for change data capture (CDC) on an Ora-
              cle source database .

          AsmUser -> (string)
              For  an  Oracle source endpoint, your ASM user name. You can set
              this value from the asm_user value. You set asm_user as part  of
              the extra connection attribute string to access an Oracle server
              with Binary Reader that uses  ASM.  For  more  information,  see
              Configuration  for change data capture (CDC) on an Oracle source
              database .

          CharLengthSemantics -> (string)
              Specifies whether the length of a character column is  in  bytes
              or  in  characters. To indicate that the character column length
              is in characters, set this attribute to CHAR  .  Otherwise,  the
              character column length is in bytes.

              Example: charLengthSemantics=CHAR;

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              Database name for the endpoint.

          DirectPathParallelLoad -> (boolean)
              When set to true , this attribute specifies a parallel load when
              useDirectPathFullLoad is set to Y .  This  attribute  also  only
              applies  when  you  use the DMS parallel load feature. Note that
              the target table cannot have any constraints or indexes.

          FailTasksOnLobTruncation -> (boolean)
              When set to true , this attribute causes a task to fail  if  the
              actual  size of an LOB column is greater than the specified Lob-
              MaxSize .

              If a task is set to limited LOB mode and this option is  set  to
              true , the task fails instead of truncating the LOB data.

          NumberDatatypeScale -> (integer)
              Specifies  the number scale. You can select a scale up to 38, or
              you can select FLOAT. By default, the NUMBER data type  is  con-
              verted to precision 38, scale 10.

              Example: numberDataTypeScale=12

          Password -> (string)
              Endpoint connection password.

          Port -> (integer)
              Endpoint TCP port.

          ReadTableSpaceName -> (boolean)
              When  set  to true , this attribute supports tablespace replica-
              tion.

          RetryInterval -> (integer)
              Specifies the number of seconds that  the  system  waits  before
              resending a query.

              Example: retryInterval=6;

          SecurityDbEncryption -> (string)
              For  an  Oracle source endpoint, the transparent data encryption
              (TDE) password required by AWM DMS to access  Oracle  redo  logs
              encrypted  by  TDE  using  Binary  Reader.  It  is  also  the ``
              TDE_Password `` part of the comma-separated value you set to the
              Password  request  parameter  when  you create the endpoint. The
              SecurityDbEncryptian setting is related  to  this  SecurityDbEn-
              cryptionName   setting.  For  more  information,  see  Supported
              encryption methods for using Oracle as a source for DMS  in  the
              Database Migration Service User Guide .

          SecurityDbEncryptionName -> (string)
              For  an  Oracle  source endpoint, the name of a key used for the
              transparent data encryption (TDE) of the columns and tablespaces
              in  an  Oracle  source database that is encrypted using TDE. The
              key value is the value of the SecurityDbEncryption setting.  For
              more  information on setting the key name value of SecurityDbEn-
              cryptionName , see the information and example for  setting  the
              securityDbEncryptionName extra connection attribute in Supported
              encryption methods for using Oracle as a source for DMS  in  the
              Database Migration Service User Guide .

          ServerName -> (string)
              Fully qualified domain name of the endpoint.

          SpatialDataOptionToGeoJsonFunctionName -> (string)
              Use this attribute to convert SDO_GEOMETRY to GEOJSON format. By
              default, DMS calls the SDO2GEOJSON custom  function  if  present
              and  accessible. Or you can create your own custom function that
              mimics the operation of SDOGEOJSON and set  SpatialDataOptionTo-
              GeoJsonFunctionName to call it instead.

          StandbyDelayTime -> (integer)
              Use this attribute to specify a time in minutes for the delay in
              standby sync. If the source  is  an  Oracle  Active  Data  Guard
              standby  database,  use  this  attribute to specify the time lag
              between primary and standby databases.

              In DMS, you can create an Oracle CDC task that  uses  an  Active
              Data  Guard standby instance as a source for replicating ongoing
              changes. Doing this eliminates the need to connect to an  active
              database that might be in production.

          Username -> (string)
              Endpoint connection user name.

          UseBFile -> (boolean)
              Set  this attribute to Y to capture change data using the Binary
              Reader utility. Set UseLogminerReader to N to set this attribute
              to  Y.  To  use  Binary Reader with Amazon RDS for Oracle as the
              source, you set  additional  attributes.  For  more  information
              about  using  this setting with Oracle Automatic Storage Manage-
              ment (ASM), see Using Oracle LogMiner or DMS Binary  Reader  for
              CDC .

          UseDirectPathFullLoad -> (boolean)
              Set this attribute to Y to have DMS use a direct path full load.
              Specify this value to use the direct path protocol in the Oracle
              Call  Interface  (OCI).  By  using  this  OCI  protocol, you can
              bulk-load Oracle target tables during a full load.

          UseLogminerReader -> (boolean)
              Set this attribute to Y to capture change data using the  Oracle
              LogMiner  utility  (the default). Set this attribute to N if you
              want to access the redo logs as a  binary  file.  When  you  set
              UseLogminerReader  to N, also set UseBfile to Y. For more infor-
              mation on this setting and using Oracle ASM,  see  Using  Oracle
              LogMiner or DMS Binary Reader for CDC in the DMS User Guide .

          SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The  full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that speci-
              fies DMS as the trusted entity and grants the  required  permis-
              sions  to  access  the  value in SecretsManagerSecret . The role
              must allow the iam:PassRole action. SecretsManagerSecret has the
              value  of  the  Amazon  Web Services Secrets Manager secret that
              allows access to the Oracle endpoint.

              NOTE:
                 You can specify one of two sets of values for  these  permis-
                 sions.  You  can  specify  the  values  for  this setting and
                 SecretsManagerSecretId . Or you can specify clear-text values
                 for  UserName  , Password , ServerName , and Port . You can't
                 specify both. For more information on creating this  Secrets-

          Port -> (integer)
              Endpoint TCP port.

          BcpPacketSize -> (integer)

              using BCP.

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              Database name for the endpoint.

          ControlTablesFileGroup -> (string)
              Specifies  a  file  group  for the DMS internal tables. When the
              replication task starts, all the internal DMS control tables (
              awsdms_
               apply_exception, awsdms_apply, awsdms_changes) are created  for
              the specified file group.

          Password -> (string)
              Endpoint connection password.

          QuerySingleAlwaysOnNode -> (boolean)
              Cleans  and recreates table metadata information on the replica-
              tion instance when a mismatch occurs. An example is a  situation
              where  running an alter DDL statement on a table might result in
              different information about the table cached in the  replication
              instance.

          ReadBackupOnly -> (boolean)
              When  this  attribute  is set to Y , DMS only reads changes from
              transaction log backups and doesn't read from the active  trans-
              action log file during ongoing replication. Setting this parame-
              ter to Y enables you to  control  active  transaction  log  file
              growth  during full load and ongoing replication tasks. However,
              it can add some source latency to ongoing replication.

          SafeguardPolicy -> (string)
              Use this attribute to minimize the need to access the backup log
              and  enable DMS to prevent truncation using one of the following
              two methods.
                 Start transactions in  the  database:  This  is  the  default
                 method.  When  this method is used, DMS prevents TLOG trunca-
                 tion by mimicking a transaction in the database. As  long  as
                 such  a  transaction  is  open, changes that appear after the
                 transaction started aren't truncated. If you  need  Microsoft
                 Replication  to  be  enabled  in your database, then you must
                 choose this method.

                 Exclusively use sp_repldone within a single task : When  this
                 method   is  used,  DMS  reads  the  changes  and  then  uses
                 sp_repldone to mark the TLOG transactions as ready for  trun-
                 cation.  Although  this  method  doesn't involve any transac-
                 tional activities, it can only be used when Microsoft  Repli-
                 cation  isn't running. Also, when using this method, only one
                 DMS task can access the database at any  given  time.  There-
                 fore,  if you need to run parallel DMS tasks against the same
                 database, use the default method.

          ServerName -> (string)
              Fully qualified domain name of the endpoint.

          Username -> (string)
              Endpoint connection user name.

          UseBcpFullLoad -> (boolean)
              Use this to attribute to transfer data for full-load  operations
              using  BCP.  When  the  target table contains an identity column
              that does not exist in the source table, you  must  disable  the
              use BCP for loading table option.

          UseThirdPartyBackupDevice -> (boolean)
              When  this  attribute  is  set  to Y , DMS processes third-party
              transaction log backups if they are created in native format.

          SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that  speci-
              fies  DMS  as the trusted entity and grants the required permis-
              sions to access the value in  SecretsManagerSecret  .  The  role
              must allow the iam:PassRole action. SecretsManagerSecret has the
              value of the Amazon Web Services  Secrets  Manager  secret  that
              allows access to the SQL Server endpoint.

              NOTE:
                 You  can  specify one of two sets of values for these permis-
                 sions. You can  specify  the  values  for  this  setting  and
                 SecretsManagerSecretId . Or you can specify clear-text values
                 for UserName , Password , ServerName , and Port .  You  can't
                 specify  both. For more information on creating this Secrets-
                 ManagerSecret   and   the   SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn   and

                 secrets to access Database Migration Service resources in the
                 Database Migration Service User Guide .

          SecretsManagerSecretId -> (string)
              The  full  ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of the SecretsMan-
              agerSecret that contains  the  SQL  Server  endpoint  connection
              details.

              the  replication  instance. If you don't specify a value for the
              KmsKeyId parameter, then DMS uses your default  encryption  key.
              KMS  creates the default encryption key for your Amazon Web Ser-
              vices account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a  different
              default encryption key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

          SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The  full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that speci-
              fies DMS as the trusted entity and grants the  required  permis-
              sions  to  access  the  value in SecretsManagerSecret . The role
              must allow the iam:PassRole action. SecretsManagerSecret has the
              value  of  the  Amazon  Web Services Secrets Manager secret that
              allows access to the DocumentDB endpoint.

              NOTE:
                 You can specify one of two sets of values for  these  permis-
                 sions.  You  can  specify  the  values  for  this setting and
                 SecretsManagerSecretId . Or you can specify clear-text values
                 for  UserName  , Password , ServerName , and Port . You can't
                 specify both. For more information on creating this  Secrets-
                 ManagerSecret   and   the   SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn   and
                 SecretsManagerSecretId  required  to  access  it,  see  Using
                 secrets to access Database Migration Service resources in the
                 Database Migration Service User Guide .

          SecretsManagerSecretId -> (string)
              The full ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of  the  SecretsMan-
              agerSecret  that  contains  the  DocumentDB  endpoint connection
              details.

          }

       --redis-settings (structure)
          Settings in JSON format for the Redis target endpoint.

          ServerName -> (string)
              Fully qualified domain name of the endpoint.

          Port -> (integer)
              Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port for the endpoint.

          SslSecurityProtocol -> (string)
              The connection to a Redis target endpoint using Transport  Layer
              Security  (TLS).  Valid values include plaintext and ssl-encryp-
              tion . The default is ssl-encryption . The ssl-encryption option
              makes  an  encrypted connection. Optionally, you can identify an
              Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for an SSL certificate authority (CA)
              using the SslCaCertificateArn setting. If an ARN isn't given for
              a CA, DMS uses the Amazon root CA.

              The plaintext option doesn't provide  Transport  Layer  Security
              (TLS) encryption for traffic between endpoint and database.

          AuthType -> (string)
              The type of authentication to perform when connecting to a Redis
              target. Options include none , auth-token , and auth-role .  The
              auth-token option requires an AuthPassword value to be provided.
              The auth-role option requires AuthUserName and AuthPassword val-
              ues to be provided.

          AuthUserName -> (string)
              The user name provided with the auth-role option of the AuthType
              setting for a Redis target endpoint.

          AuthPassword -> (string)
              The password provided with the auth-role and auth-token  options
              of the AuthType setting for a Redis target endpoint.

          SslCaCertificateArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) for the certificate authority
              (CA) that DMS uses to connect to your Redis target endpoint.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ServerName=string,Port=integer,SslSecurityProtocol=string,AuthType=string,AuthUserName=string,AuthPassword=string,SslCaCertificateArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ServerName": "string",
            "Port": integer,
            "SslSecurityProtocol": "plaintext"|"ssl-encryption",

          }

       --exact-settings | --no-exact-settings (boolean)
          If this attribute is Y, the current call to ModifyEndpoint  replaces
          all  existing  endpoint  settings  with  the exact settings that you
          specify in this call. If this attribute is N, the  current  call  to
          ModifyEndpoint does two things:

          o It replaces any endpoint settings that already exist with new val-
            ues, for settings with the same names.

          o It creates new endpoint settings that you specify in the call, for
            settings with different names.

          For  example,  if  you  call create-endpoint ... --endpoint-settings
          '{"a":1}' ... , the endpoint has the  following  endpoint  settings:
          '{"a":1}' . If you then call modify-endpoint ... --endpoint-settings
          '{"b":2}' ... for the same endpoint, the endpoint has the  following
          settings: '{"a":1,"b":2}' .

          However, suppose that you follow this with a call to modify-endpoint
          ... --endpoint-settings '{"b":2}' --exact-settings ... for that same
          endpoint  again.  Then  the  endpoint  has  the  following settings:
          '{"b":2}' . All existing settings are replaced with the  exact  set-
          tings that you specify.

       --gcp-my-sql-settings (structure)
          Settings in JSON format for the source GCP MySQL endpoint.

          AfterConnectScript -> (string)
              Specifies  a script to run immediately after DMS connects to the
              endpoint. The migration task continues running regardless if the
              SQL statement succeeds or fails.

              For  this  parameter, provide the code of the script itself, not
              the name of a file containing the script.

          CleanSourceMetadataOnMismatch -> (boolean)
              Adjusts the behavior of DMS when migrating from  an  SQL  Server
              source  database  that  is hosted as part of an Always On avail-
              ability group cluster. If you need DMS to poll all the nodes  in
              the   Always  On  cluster  for  transaction  backups,  set  this
              attribute to false .

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              Database name for the endpoint. For a  MySQL  source  or  target
              endpoint,  don't  explicitly  specify  the  database  using  the
              DatabaseName request parameter on either the  CreateEndpoint  or
              ModifyEndpoint API call. Specifying DatabaseName when you create
              or modify a MySQL endpoint replicates all  the  task  tables  to
              this single database. For MySQL endpoints, you specify the data-
              base only when you specify the schema in the table-mapping rules
              of the DMS task.

          EventsPollInterval -> (integer)
              Specifies   how   often   to   check  the  binary  log  for  new
              changes/events when the database is idle. The  default  is  five
              seconds.

              Example: eventsPollInterval=5;

              In  the example, DMS checks for changes in the binary logs every
              five seconds.

          TargetDbType -> (string)
              Specifies where to migrate source tables on the  target,  either
              to a single database or multiple databases.

              Example: targetDbType=MULTIPLE_DATABASES

          MaxFileSize -> (integer)
              Specifies  the  maximum  size  (in  KB) of any .csv file used to
              transfer data to a MySQL-compatible database.

              Example: maxFileSize=512

          ParallelLoadThreads -> (integer)
              Improves performance when loading data into the MySQL-compatible
              target  database.  Specifies how many threads to use to load the
              data into the MySQL-compatible target database. Setting a  large
              number of threads can have an adverse effect on database perfor-
              mance, because  a  separate  connection  is  required  for  each
              thread. The default is one.

              Example: parallelLoadThreads=1

          Password -> (string)
              Endpoint connection password.

          Port -> (integer)

          ServerName -> (string)
              Endpoint TCP port.

          ServerTimezone -> (string)
              Specifies the time zone for the source MySQL database.

              Example: serverTimezone=US/Pacific;

              Note: Do not enclose time zones in single quotes.

          Username -> (string)
              Endpoint connection user name.

          SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The  full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that speci-
              fies DMS as the trusted entity and grants the  required  permis-
              sions to access the value in SecretsManagerSecret. The role must
              allow the  iam:PassRole  action.  SecretsManagerSecret  has  the
              value  of  the  Amazon  Web Services Secrets Manager secret that
              allows access to the MySQL endpoint.

              NOTE:
                 You can specify one of two sets of values for  these  permis-
                 sions.  You  can  specify  the  values  for  this setting and
                 SecretsManagerSecretId . Or you can specify clear-text values
                 for  UserName  , Password , ServerName , and Port . You can't
                 specify both. For more information on creating this  Secrets-
                 ManagerSecret   and   the   SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn   and
                 SecretsManagerSecretId  required  to  access  it,  see  Using
                 secrets to access Database Migration Service resources in the
                 Database Migration Service User Guide.

          SecretsManagerSecretId -> (string)
              The full ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of  the  SecretsMan-
              agerSecret  that contains the MySQL endpoint connection details.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              "sqlserver" , and "neptune" .

          EngineDisplayName -> (string)
              The expanded name for the engine name. For example, if the Engi-
              neName parameter is "aurora," this value would be "Amazon Aurora
              MySQL."

          Username -> (string)
              The user name used to connect to the endpoint.

              An KMS key identifier that is used  to  encrypt  the  connection
              parameters for the endpoint.

              If  you  don't  specify a value for the KmsKeyId parameter, then
              DMS uses your default encryption key.

              KMS creates the default encryption key for your Amazon Web  Ser-
              vices  account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different
              default encryption key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

          EndpointArn -> (string)

              endpoint.

          SslMode -> (string)
              The SSL mode used to connect to the endpoint. The default  value
              is none .

          ServiceAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) used by the service to access the
              IAM role. The role must allow the iam:PassRole action.

          ExternalTableDefinition -> (string)
              The external table definition.

          ExternalId -> (string)
              Value returned by a call to CreateEndpoint that can be used  for
              cross-account  validation.  Use  it on a subsequent call to Cre-
              ateEndpoint to create the endpoint with a cross-account.

          DynamoDbSettings -> (structure)
              The settings for the DynamoDB target endpoint. For more informa-
              tion, see the DynamoDBSettings structure.

              ServiceAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) used by the service to access

                 the IAM role. The role must allow the iam:PassRole action. It
                 is  a  required  parameter that enables DMS to write and read
                 objects from an S3 bucket.

              ExternalTableDefinition -> (string)
                 Specifies how tables are defined in the S3 source files only.

              CsvRowDelimiter -> (string)
                 The delimiter used to separate rows in the .csv file for both
                 source and target. The default is a carriage return (\n ).

              CsvDelimiter -> (string)
                 The delimiter used to separate columns in the .csv  file  for
                 both source and target. The default is a comma.

              BucketFolder -> (string)
                 An  optional parameter to set a folder name in the S3 bucket.
                 If provided, tables are created in the path  ``  bucketFolder
                 /schema_name /table_name /`` . If this parameter isn't speci-
                 fied, then the path used is `` schema_name /table_name /``  .

              BucketName -> (string)
                 The name of the S3 bucket.

              CompressionType -> (string)
                 An  optional  parameter  to  use  GZIP to compress the target
                 files. Set to GZIP to compress the target files.  Either  set
                 this parameter to NONE (the default) or don't use it to leave
                 the files uncompressed. This parameter applies to  both  .csv
                 and .parquet file formats.

              EncryptionMode -> (string)
                 The  type  of server-side encryption that you want to use for
                 your data. This encryption type is part of the endpoint  set-
                 tings  or the extra connections attributes for Amazon S3. You
                 can choose either SSE_S3 (the default) or SSE_KMS .

                 NOTE:
                     For the ModifyEndpoint  operation,  you  can  change  the
                     existing  value  of  the  EncryptionMode  parameter  from
                     SSE_KMS to SSE_S3 . But  you  cant  change  the  existing
                     value from SSE_S3 to SSE_KMS .

                 To  use  SSE_S3  , you need an Identity and Access Management
                 (IAM) role with permission to allow  "arn:aws:s3:::dms-*"  to
                 use the following actions:

                 o s3:CreateBucket

                 o s3:ListBucket

                 o s3:DeleteBucket

                 o s3:GetBucketLocation

                 o s3:GetObject

                 o s3:PutObject

                 o s3:DeleteObject

                 o s3:GetObjectVersion

                 o s3:GetBucketPolicy

                 o s3:PutBucketPolicy

                 o s3:DeleteBucketPolicy

              ServerSideEncryptionKmsKeyId -> (string)
                 If you are using SSE_KMS for the EncryptionMode , provide the
                 KMS key ID. The key that you use  needs  an  attached  policy
                 that  enables  Identity and Access Management (IAM) user per-
                 missions and allows use of the key.

                 Here is a CLI example:
                 ``
                 aws dms create-endpoint  --endpoint-identifier  value  --end-
                 point-type  target  --engine-name s3 --s3-settings ServiceAc-
                 cessRoleArn=*value* ,BucketFolder=*value* ,BucketName=*value*
                 ,EncryptionMode=SSE_KMS,ServerSideEncryptionKmsKeyId=*value*
                 ``

              DataFormat -> (string)
                 The format of the data that you want to use for  output.  You
                 can choose one of the following:

                 o csv  : This is a row-based file format with comma-separated
                   values (.csv).

                 o parquet : Apache Parquet (.parquet) is a  columnar  storage
                   file  format  that  features efficient compression and pro-
                   vides faster query response.

              EncodingType -> (string)
                 The type of encoding you are using:

                 o RLE_DICTIONARY  uses  a  combination  of  bit-packing   and
                   run-length  encoding  to  store  repeated values more effi-
                   ciently. This is the default.

                 o PLAIN doesn't use encoding at all.  Values  are  stored  as
                   they are.

                 o PLAIN_DICTIONARY  builds a dictionary of the values encoun-
                   tered in a given column. The dictionary is stored in a dic-
                   tionary page for each column chunk.

              DictPageSizeLimit -> (integer)
                 The  maximum  size of an encoded dictionary page of a column.
                 If the dictionary page exceeds this, this  column  is  stored
                 using  an encoding type of PLAIN . This parameter defaults to
                 1024 * 1024 bytes (1 MiB), the maximum size of  a  dictionary
                 page  before  it reverts to PLAIN encoding. This size is used
                 for .parquet file format only.

              RowGroupLength -> (integer)
                 The number of rows in a row group. A smaller row  group  size
                 provides faster reads. But as the number of row groups grows,
                 the slower writes become. This parameter defaults  to  10,000
                 rows. This number is used for .parquet file format only.

                 If you choose a value larger than the maximum, RowGroupLength
                 is set to the max row group length in  bytes  (64  *  1024  *
                 1024).

              DataPageSize -> (integer)
                 The  size  of one data page in bytes. This parameter defaults
                 to 1024 * 1024 bytes (1 MiB). This number is used  for  .par-
                 quet file format only.

              ParquetVersion -> (string)
                 The  version  of  the  Apache Parquet format that you want to
                 use: parquet_1_0 (the default) or parquet_2_0 .

              EnableStatistics -> (boolean)
                 A value that enables statistics for  Parquet  pages  and  row
                 groups.  Choose  true to enable statistics, false to disable.
                 Statistics include NULL , DISTINCT , MAX ,  and  MIN  values.
                 This  parameter  defaults  to  true  . This value is used for
                 .parquet file format only.

              IncludeOpForFullLoad -> (boolean)
                 A value that enables a full load to write  INSERT  operations
                 to  the  comma-separated  value  (.csv)  output files only to
                 indicate how the rows were added to the source database.

                 NOTE:
                     DMS supports the IncludeOpForFullLoad parameter  in  ver-
                     sions 3.1.4 and later.

                 For  full load, records can only be inserted. By default (the
                 false setting), no information is recorded  in  these  output
                 files for a full load to indicate that the rows were inserted
                 at the source database. If  IncludeOpForFullLoad  is  set  to
                 true  or y , the INSERT is recorded as an I annotation in the
                 first field of the .csv file. This allows the format of  your
                 target  records  from  a  full load to be consistent with the
                 target records from a CDC load.

                 NOTE:
                     This setting works together with the  CdcInsertsOnly  and
                     the  CdcInsertsAndUpdates  parameters  for output to .csv
                     files only. For more information about how these settings
                     work  together,  see  Indicating  Source DB Operations in
                     Migrated S3 Data in the Database Migration  Service  User
                     Guide. .

              CdcInsertsOnly -> (boolean)
                 A  value  that  enables  a  change data capture (CDC) load to
                 write only INSERT operations  to  .csv  or  columnar  storage
                 (.parquet)  output files. By default (the false setting), the
                 first field in a .csv or .parquet record contains the  letter
                 I  (INSERT), U (UPDATE), or D (DELETE). These values indicate
                 whether the row was inserted,  updated,  or  deleted  at  the
                 source database for a CDC load to the target.

                 If CdcInsertsOnly is set to true or y , only INSERTs from the
                 source database are migrated to the .csv  or  .parquet  file.
                 For  .csv format only, how these INSERTs are recorded depends
                 on the value of IncludeOpForFullLoad .  If  IncludeOpForFull-
                 Load  is set to true , the first field of every CDC record is
                 set to I to indicate the INSERT operation at the  source.  If
                 IncludeOpForFullLoad  is  set  to false , every CDC record is
                 written without a first field to indicate the  INSERT  opera-
                 tion at the source. For more information about how these set-
                 tings work together, see Indicating Source DB  Operations  in
                 Migrated  S3  Data  in  the  Database  Migration Service User
                 Guide. .

                 NOTE:
                     DMS supports the interaction described preceding  between
                     the CdcInsertsOnly and IncludeOpForFullLoad parameters in
                     versions 3.1.4 and later.
                        CdcInsertsOnly and CdcInsertsAndUpdates can't both  be
                        set  to  true for the same endpoint. Set either CdcIn-
                        sertsOnly or CdcInsertsAndUpdates to true for the same
                        endpoint, but not both.

              TimestampColumnName -> (string)
                 A  value  that  when nonblank causes DMS to add a column with
                 timestamp information to the endpoint data for an  Amazon  S3
                 target.

                 NOTE:
                     DMS  supports  the  TimestampColumnName parameter in ver-
                     sions 3.1.4 and later.

                 DMS includes an additional STRING column in the .csv or .par-
                 quet  object  files of your migrated data when you set Times-
                 tampColumnName to a nonblank value.

                 For a full load, each row of this timestamp column contains a
                 timestamp  for  when the data was transferred from the source
                 to the target by DMS.

                 For a change data capture (CDC) load, each row of  the  time-
                 stamp  column  contains  the timestamp for the commit of that
                 row in the source database.

                 The  string  format  for  this  timestamp  column  value   is
                 yyyy-MM-dd  HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS  .  By  default, the precision of
                 this value is in microseconds. For a CDC load,  the  rounding
                 of the precision depends on the commit timestamp supported by
                 DMS for the source database.

                 When the AddColumnName parameter is set to true  ,  DMS  also
                 includes  a  name  for the timestamp column that you set with
                 TimestampColumnName .

              ParquetTimestampInMillisecond -> (boolean)
                 A value that specifies the precision of any TIMESTAMP  column
                 values  that are written to an Amazon S3 object file in .par-
                 quet format.

                 NOTE:
                     DMS supports the ParquetTimestampInMillisecond  parameter
                     in versions 3.1.4 and later.

                 When  ParquetTimestampInMillisecond is set to true or y , DMS
                 writes all TIMESTAMP columns in  a  .parquet  formatted  file
                 with  millisecond  precision. Otherwise, DMS writes them with
                 microsecond precision.

                 Currently, Amazon Athena and Glue can handle only millisecond
                 precision  for  TIMESTAMP  values. Set this parameter to true
                 for S3 endpoint object files that are .parquet formatted only
                 if you plan to query or process the data with Athena or Glue.

                 NOTE:
                     DMS writes any TIMESTAMP column values written to  an  S3
                     file in .csv format with microsecond precision.

                     Setting  ParquetTimestampInMillisecond  has  no effect on
                     the string format of the timestamp column value  that  is
                     inserted by setting the TimestampColumnName parameter.

              CdcInsertsAndUpdates -> (boolean)
                 A  value  that  enables  a  change data capture (CDC) load to
                 write INSERT  and  UPDATE  operations  to  .csv  or  .parquet
                 (columnar storage) output files. The default setting is false
                 , but when CdcInsertsAndUpdates is set to true or  y  ,  only
                 INSERTs  and UPDATEs from the source database are migrated to
                 the .csv or .parquet file.

                 For .csv file format only, how these INSERTs and UPDATEs  are
                 recorded  depends  on  the  value of the IncludeOpForFullLoad
                 parameter. If IncludeOpForFullLoad is set to true , the first
                 field of every CDC record is set to either I or U to indicate
                 INSERT and UPDATE operations at the source. But if IncludeOp-
                 ForFullLoad is set to false , CDC records are written without
                 an indication of INSERT or UPDATE operations at  the  source.
                 For  more information about how these settings work together,
                 see Indicating Source DB Operations in Migrated  S3  Data  in
                 the Database Migration Service User Guide. .

                 NOTE:
                     DMS  supports the use of the CdcInsertsAndUpdates parame-
                     ter in versions 3.3.1 and later.
                        CdcInsertsOnly and CdcInsertsAndUpdates can't both  be
                        set  to  true for the same endpoint. Set either CdcIn-
                        sertsOnly or CdcInsertsAndUpdates to true for the same
                        endpoint, but not both.

              DatePartitionEnabled -> (boolean)
                 When  set to true , this parameter partitions S3 bucket fold-
                 ers based on transaction commit dates. The default  value  is
                 false  .  For more information about date-based folder parti-
                 tioning, see Using date-based folder partitioning .

              DatePartitionSequence -> (string)
                 Identifies the sequence of the  date  format  to  use  during
                 folder partitioning. The default value is YYYYMMDD . Use this
                 parameter when DatePartitionedEnabled is set to true .

              DatePartitionDelimiter -> (string)
                 Specifies a date separating delimiter to  use  during  folder
                 partitioning. The default value is SLASH . Use this parameter
                 when DatePartitionedEnabled is set to true .

              UseCsvNoSupValue -> (boolean)
                 This setting applies if the S3 output files during  a  change
                 data capture (CDC) load are written in .csv format. If set to
                 true for columns not included in the  supplemental  log,  DMS
                 uses    the    value    specified    by    `    CsvNoSupValue
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_S3Settings.html#DMS-Type-S3Settings-CsvNoSupValue`__
                 .  If  not  set or set to false , DMS uses the null value for
                 these columns.

                 NOTE:
                     This setting is  supported  in  DMS  versions  3.4.1  and
                     later.

              CsvNoSupValue -> (string)
                 This setting only applies if your Amazon S3 output files dur-
                 ing a change data capture (CDC) load are written in .csv for-
                 mat.             If             `            UseCsvNoSupValue
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_S3Settings.html#DMS-Type-S3Settings-UseCsvNoSupValue`__
                 is  set  to true, specify a string value that you want DMS to
                 use for all columns not included in the supplemental log.  If
                 you  do  not  specify a string value, DMS uses the null value
                 for these columns regardless of the UseCsvNoSupValue setting.

                 NOTE:
                     This  setting  is  supported  in  DMS  versions 3.4.1 and
                     later.

              PreserveTransactions -> (boolean)
                 If set to true , DMS saves the transaction order for a change
                 data  capture (CDC) load on the Amazon S3 target specified by
                 `                                                     CdcPath
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_S3Settings.html#DMS-Type-S3Settings-CdcPath`__
                 . For more information,  see  Capturing  data  changes  (CDC)
                 including transaction order on the S3 target .

                 NOTE:
                     This  setting  is  supported  in  DMS  versions 3.4.2 and
                     later.

              CdcPath -> (string)
                 Specifies the folder path of CDC files.  For  an  S3  source,
                 this setting is required if a task captures change data; oth-
                 erwise, it's optional. If CdcPath is set, DMS reads CDC files
                 from  this path and replicates the data changes to the target
                 endpoint. For an S3 target if you set `  PreserveTransactions
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_S3Settings.html#DMS-Type-S3Settings-PreserveTransactions`__
                 to true , DMS verifies that you have set this parameter to  a
                 folder path on your S3 target where DMS can save the transac-
                 tion order for the CDC load. DMS creates this CDC folder path
                 in  either  your S3 target working directory or the S3 target
                 location       specified       by       `        BucketFolder
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_S3Settings.html#DMS-Type-S3Settings-BucketFolder`__
                 and                       `                        BucketName
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_S3Settings.html#DMS-Type-S3Settings-BucketName`__
                 .

                 For example, if you specify CdcPath as  MyChangedData  ,  and
                 you  specify  BucketName as MyTargetBucket but do not specify
                 BucketFolder , DMS creates the  CDC  folder  path  following:
                 MyTargetBucket/MyChangedData .

                 If  you specify the same CdcPath , and you specify BucketName
                 as MyTargetBucket and BucketFolder as MyTargetData , DMS cre-
                 ates  the CDC folder path following: MyTargetBucket/MyTarget-
                 Data/MyChangedData .

                 For more information on CDC including transaction order on an
                 S3  target, see Capturing data changes (CDC) including trans-
                 action order on the S3 target .

                 NOTE:
                     This setting is  supported  in  DMS  versions  3.4.2  and
                     later.

              UseTaskStartTimeForFullLoadTimestamp -> (boolean)
                 When  set to true, this parameter uses the task start time as
                 the timestamp column value instead of the time data is  writ-
                 ten  to  target. For full load, when useTaskStartTimeForFull-
                 LoadTimestamp is set to true , each row of the timestamp col-
                 umn  contains the task start time. For CDC loads, each row of
                 the timestamp column contains the transaction commit time.

                 When useTaskStartTimeForFullLoadTimestamp is set to  false  ,
                 the  full  load  timestamp in the timestamp column increments
                 with the time data arrives at the target.

              CannedAclForObjects -> (string)
                 A value that enables DMS to  specify  a  predefined  (canned)
                 access  control  list  for  objects  created  in an Amazon S3
                 bucket as .csv or .parquet files. For more information  about
                 Amazon S3 canned ACLs, see Canned ACL in the Amazon S3 Devel-
                 oper Guide.

                 The default value is NONE. Valid values  include  NONE,  PRI-
                 VATE,   PUBLIC_READ,  PUBLIC_READ_WRITE,  AUTHENTICATED_READ,
                 AWS_EXEC_READ, BUCKET_OWNER_READ, and  BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CON-
                 TROL.

              AddColumnName -> (boolean)
                 An  optional  parameter that, when set to true or y , you can
                 use to add column name information to the .csv output file.

                 The default value is false . Valid values are true , false  ,
                 y , and n .

              CdcMaxBatchInterval -> (integer)
                 Maximum  length  of  the  interval, defined in seconds, after
                 which to output a file to Amazon S3.

                 When CdcMaxBatchInterval and CdcMinFileSize are  both  speci-
                 fied, the file write is triggered by whichever parameter con-
                 dition is met first within an DMS CloudFormation template.

                 The default value is 60 seconds.

              CdcMinFileSize -> (integer)
                 Minimum file size, defined in megabytes, to reach for a  file
                 output to Amazon S3.

                 When  CdcMinFileSize  and CdcMaxBatchInterval are both speci-
                 fied, the file write is triggered by whichever parameter con-
                 dition is met first within an DMS CloudFormation template.

                 The default value is 32 MB.

              CsvNullValue -> (string)
                 An optional parameter that specifies how DMS treats null val-
                 ues. While handling the null value, you can use this  parame-
                 ter to pass a user-defined string as null when writing to the
                 target. For example, when target columns  are  not  nullable,
                 you  can  use  this option to differentiate between the empty
                 string value and the null value. So, if you set this  parame-
                 ter  value  to  the  empty  string ("" or ''), DMS treats the
                 empty string as the null value instead of NULL .

                 The default value is NULL . Valid values  include  any  valid
                 string.

              IgnoreHeaderRows -> (integer)
                 When this value is set to 1, DMS ignores the first row header
                 in a .csv file. A value of 1 turns on the feature; a value of
                 0 turns off the feature.

                 The default is 0.

              MaxFileSize -> (integer)
                 A  value  that specifies the maximum size (in KB) of any .csv
                 file to be created while migrating to  an  S3  target  during
                 full load.

                 The  default  value  is  1,048,576  KB  (1  GB). Valid values
                 include 1 to 1,048,576.

              Rfc4180 -> (boolean)
                 For an S3 source, when this value is set to true or y ,  each
                 leading double quotation mark has to be followed by an ending
                 double quotation mark.  This  formatting  complies  with  RFC
                 4180.  When this value is set to false or n , string literals
                 are copied to the target as is. In  this  case,  a  delimiter
                 (row or column) signals the end of the field. Thus, you can't
                 use a delimiter as part of the string, because it signals the
                 end of the value.

                 For  an S3 target, an optional parameter used to set behavior
                 to comply with RFC 4180 for data migrated to Amazon S3  using
                 .csv  file  format  only. When this value is set to true or y
                 using Amazon S3 as a target, if the data has quotation  marks
                 or  newline  characters in it, DMS encloses the entire column
                 with an additional pair of double quotation marks (").  Every
                 quotation mark within the data is repeated twice.

                 The default value is true . Valid values include true , false
                 , y , and n .

              DatePartitionTimezone -> (string)
                 When creating an S3 target endpoint,  set  DatePartitionTime-
                 zone  to  convert  the current UTC time into a specified time
                 zone. The conversion occurs when a date partition  folder  is
                 created and a CDC filename is generated. The time zone format
                 is Area/Location. Use this parameter when  DatePartitionedEn-
                 abled is set to true , as shown in the following example.
                     s3-settings='{"DatePartitionEnabled":  true,  "DateParti-
                     tionSequence":  "YYYYMMDDHH",   "DatePartitionDelimiter":
                     "SLASH",     "DatePartitionTimezone":"*Asia/Seoul*     ",
                     "BucketName": "dms-nattarat-test"}'

          DmsTransferSettings -> (structure)
              The settings for the DMS Transfer type source. For more informa-
              tion, see the DmsTransferSettings structure.

              ServiceAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) used by the service access IAM
                 role. The role must allow the iam:PassRole action.

                 The name of the S3 bucket to use.

          MongoDbSettings -> (structure)
              The settings for the MongoDB source endpoint. For more  informa-
              tion, see the MongoDbSettings structure.

              Username -> (string)
                 The  user name you use to access the MongoDB source endpoint.

              Password -> (string)
                 The password for the user account you use to access the  Mon-
                 goDB source endpoint.

              ServerName -> (string)
                 The name of the server on the MongoDB source endpoint.

              Port -> (integer)
                 The port value for the MongoDB source endpoint.

              DatabaseName -> (string)
                 The database name on the MongoDB source endpoint.

              AuthType -> (string)
                 The  authentication type you use to access the MongoDB source
                 endpoint.

                 When when set to "no" , user name and password parameters are
                 not used and can be empty.

              AuthMechanism -> (string)
                 The  authentication  mechanism  you use to access the MongoDB
                 source endpoint.

                 For the default value, in MongoDB version 2.x,  "default"  is
                 "mongodb_cr" . For MongoDB version 3.x or later, "default" is
                 "scram_sha_1" . This setting isn't used when AuthType is  set
                 to "no" .

              NestingLevel -> (string)
                 Specifies either document or table mode.

                 Default  value  is  "none"  .  Specify "none" to use document
                 mode. Specify "one" to use table mode.

              ExtractDocId -> (string)
                 Specifies the document ID. Use this setting when NestingLevel
                 is set to "none" .

                 Default value is "false" .

              DocsToInvestigate -> (string)
                 Indicates the number of documents to preview to determine the
                 document organization. Use this setting when NestingLevel  is
                 set to "one" .

                 Must  be  a  positive value greater than 0 . Default value is
                 1000 .

              AuthSource -> (string)
                 The MongoDB database  name.  This  setting  isn't  used  when
                 AuthType is set to "no" .

                 The default is "admin" .

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The KMS key identifier that is used to encrypt the content on
                 the replication instance. If you don't specify  a  value  for
                 the KmsKeyId parameter, then DMS uses your default encryption
                 key. KMS creates the default encryption key for  your  Amazon
                 Web  Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a
                 different default encryption key for each Amazon Web Services
                 Region.

              SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The  full  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the IAM role that
                 specifies DMS as the trusted entity and grants  the  required
                 permissions to access the value in SecretsManagerSecret . The
                 role must allow the iam:PassRole action. SecretsManagerSecret
                 has  the  value  of  the  Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager
                 secret that allows access to the MongoDB endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     You can specify one of two sets of values for these  per-
                     missions. You can specify the values for this setting and
                     SecretsManagerSecretId . Or you  can  specify  clear-text
                     values  for UserName , Password , ServerName , and Port .
                     You can't specify both. For more information on  creating
                     this  SecretsManagerSecret  and the SecretsManagerAccess-
                     RoleArn and SecretsManagerSecretId required to access it,
                     see  Using  secrets  to access Database Migration Service
                     resources in the Database Migration Service User Guide  .

              SecretsManagerSecretId -> (string)
                 The  full  ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of the Secrets-
                 ManagerSecret that contains the MongoDB  endpoint  connection
                 details.

          KinesisSettings -> (structure)
              The  settings  for  the Amazon Kinesis target endpoint. For more
              information, see the KinesisSettings structure.

              StreamArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the  Amazon  Kinesis  Data
                 Streams endpoint.

              MessageFormat -> (string)
                 The  output  format  for the records created on the endpoint.
                 The message format is JSON (default) or  JSON_UNFORMATTED  (a
                 single line with no tab).

              ServiceAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the IAM role that DMS uses
                 to write to the Kinesis data stream. The role must allow  the
                 iam:PassRole action.

              IncludeTransactionDetails -> (boolean)
                 Provides  detailed  transaction  information  from the source
                 database. This information includes a commit timestamp, a log
                 position,  and  values for transaction_id , previous transac-
                 tion_id , and transaction_record_id (the record offset within
                 a transaction). The default is false .

              IncludePartitionValue -> (boolean)
                 Shows  the partition value within the Kinesis message output,
                 unless the partition type is schema-table-type . The  default
                 is false .

              PartitionIncludeSchemaTable -> (boolean)
                 Prefixes schema and table names to partition values, when the
                 partition type is primary-key-type  .  Doing  this  increases
                 data  distribution among Kinesis shards. For example, suppose
                 that a SysBench schema has thousands of tables and each table
                 has  only  limited range for a primary key. In this case, the
                 same primary key is sent from thousands of tables to the same
                 shard, which causes throttling. The default is false .

              IncludeTableAlterOperations -> (boolean)
                 Includes  any  data definition language (DDL) operations that
                 change the table in the control data, such as rename-table  ,
                 drop-table  ,  add-column , drop-column , and rename-column .
                 The default is false .

              IncludeControlDetails -> (boolean)
                 Shows detailed control information for table definition, col-
                 umn  definition,  and table and column changes in the Kinesis
                 message output. The default is false .

              IncludeNullAndEmpty -> (boolean)
                 Include NULL and empty columns for records  migrated  to  the
                 endpoint. The default is false .

              NoHexPrefix -> (boolean)
                 Set  this  optional  parameter to true to avoid adding a '0x'
                 prefix to raw data in hexadecimal  format.  For  example,  by
                 default,  DMS  adds  a  '0x' prefix to the LOB column type in
                 hexadecimal format moving from an Oracle source to an  Amazon
                 Kinesis  target.  Use  the  NoHexPrefix  endpoint  setting to
                 enable migration of RAW data type columns without adding  the
                 '0x' prefix.

          KafkaSettings -> (structure)
              The  settings  for  the  Apache  Kafka target endpoint. For more
              information, see the KafkaSettings structure.

              Broker -> (string)
                 A comma-separated list of one or  more  broker  locations  in
                 your  Kafka  cluster  that  host your Kafka instance. Specify
                 each broker location in  the  form  ``  broker-hostname-or-ip
                 :port `` . For example, "ec2-12-345-678-901.compute-1.amazon-
                 aws.com:2345" . For more information and examples of specify-
                 ing  a  list of broker locations, see Using Apache Kafka as a
                 target for Database Migration Service in the Database  Migra-
                 tion Service User Guide .

              Topic -> (string)
                 The topic to which you migrate the data. If you don't specify
                 a topic, DMS specifies "kafka-default-topic" as the migration
                 topic.

              MessageFormat -> (string)
                 The  output  format  for the records created on the endpoint.
                 The message format is JSON (default) or  JSON_UNFORMATTED  (a
                 single line with no tab).

              IncludeTransactionDetails -> (boolean)
                 Provides  detailed  transaction  information  from the source
                 database. This information includes a commit timestamp, a log
                 position,  and  values for transaction_id , previous transac-
                 tion_id , and transaction_record_id (the record offset within
                 a transaction). The default is false .

              IncludePartitionValue -> (boolean)
                 Shows  the  partition  value  within the Kafka message output
                 unless the partition type is schema-table-type . The  default
                 is false .

              PartitionIncludeSchemaTable -> (boolean)
                 Prefixes schema and table names to partition values, when the
                 partition type is primary-key-type  .  Doing  this  increases
                 data  distribution  among Kafka partitions. For example, sup-
                 pose that a SysBench schema has thousands of tables and  each
                 table has only limited range for a primary key. In this case,
                 the same primary key is sent from thousands of tables to  the
                 same partition, which causes throttling. The default is false
                 .

              IncludeTableAlterOperations -> (boolean)
                 Includes any data definition language (DDL)  operations  that
                 change  the table in the control data, such as rename-table ,
                 drop-table , add-column , drop-column , and  rename-column  .
                 The default is false .

              IncludeControlDetails -> (boolean)
                 Shows detailed control information for table definition, col-
                 umn definition, and table and column  changes  in  the  Kafka
                 message output. The default is false .

              MessageMaxBytes -> (integer)
                 The maximum size in bytes for records created on the endpoint
                 The default is 1,000,000.

              IncludeNullAndEmpty -> (boolean)
                 Include NULL and empty columns for records  migrated  to  the
                 endpoint. The default is false .

              SecurityProtocol -> (string)
                 Set secure connection to a Kafka target endpoint using Trans-
                 port Layer Security (TLS). Options include  ssl-encryption  ,
                 ssl-authentication   ,   and  sasl-ssl  .  sasl-ssl  requires
                 SaslUsername and SaslPassword .

              SslClientCertificateArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the client certificate used
                 to securely connect to a Kafka target endpoint.

              SslClientKeyArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) for the client private key
                 used to securely connect to a Kafka target endpoint.

              SslClientKeyPassword -> (string)
                 The password for the client private key used to securely con-
                 nect to a Kafka target endpoint.

              SslCaCertificateArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) for the private certificate
                 authority (CA) cert that DMS uses to securely connect to your
                 Kafka target endpoint.

              SaslUsername -> (string)
                 The  secure  user name you created when you first set up your
                 MSK cluster  to  validate  a  client  identity  and  make  an
                 encrypted connection between server and client using SASL-SSL
                 authentication.

              SaslPassword -> (string)
                 The secure password you created when you first  set  up  your
                 MSK  cluster  to  validate  a  client  identity  and  make an
                 encrypted connection between server and client using SASL-SSL
                 authentication.

              NoHexPrefix -> (boolean)
                 Set  this  optional  parameter to true to avoid adding a '0x'
                 prefix to raw data in hexadecimal  format.  For  example,  by
                 default,  DMS  adds  a  '0x' prefix to the LOB column type in
                 hexadecimal format moving from an Oracle source  to  a  Kafka
                 target. Use the NoHexPrefix endpoint setting to enable migra-
                 tion of RAW data type columns without adding the '0x' prefix.

          ElasticsearchSettings -> (structure)
              The settings for the OpenSearch source endpoint. For more infor-
              mation, see the ElasticsearchSettings structure.

              ServiceAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) used by the service to  access
                 the IAM role. The role must allow the iam:PassRole action.

              EndpointUri -> (string)
                 The  endpoint for the OpenSearch cluster. DMS uses HTTPS if a
                 transport protocol (http/https) is not specified.

              FullLoadErrorPercentage -> (integer)
                 The maximum percentage of records that can fail to be written
                 before a full load operation stops.

                 To  avoid early failure, this counter is only effective after
                 1000 records are transferred. OpenSearch also has the concept
                 of error monitoring during the last 10 minutes of an Observa-
                 tion Window. If transfer of all records fail in the  last  10
                 minutes, the full load operation stops.

              ErrorRetryDuration -> (integer)
                 The  maximum  number  of seconds for which DMS retries failed
                 API requests to the OpenSearch cluster.

          NeptuneSettings -> (structure)
              The settings for the Amazon Neptune target  endpoint.  For  more
              information, see the NeptuneSettings structure.

              ServiceAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the service role that you
                 created for the Neptune target endpoint. The role must  allow
                 the  iam:PassRole  action. For more information, see Creating
                 an IAM Service Role for Accessing Amazon Neptune as a  Target
                 in the Database Migration Service User Guide.

              S3BucketName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the Amazon S3 bucket where DMS can temporarily
                 store migrated graph data in .csv files  before  bulk-loading
                 it  to  the  Neptune target database. DMS maps the SQL source
                 data to graph data before storing it in these .csv files.

              S3BucketFolder -> (string)
                 A folder path where you want DMS to store migrated graph data
                 in the S3 bucket specified by S3BucketName

              ErrorRetryDuration -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  milliseconds  for  DMS  to  wait  to retry a
                 bulk-load of migrated graph data to the Neptune target  data-
                 base before raising an error. The default is 250.

              MaxFileSize -> (integer)
                 The  maximum  size in kilobytes of migrated graph data stored
                 in a .csv file before DMS bulk-loads the data to the  Neptune
                 target  database.  The  default  is 1,048,576 KB. If the bulk
                 load is successful, DMS clears the bucket, ready to store the
                 next batch of migrated graph data.

              MaxRetryCount -> (integer)
                 The  number of times for DMS to retry a bulk load of migrated
                 graph data to the Neptune target database before  raising  an
                 error. The default is 5.

              IamAuthEnabled -> (boolean)
                 If  you  want Identity and Access Management (IAM) authoriza-
                 tion enabled for this endpoint, set this parameter to true  .
                 Then  attach the appropriate IAM policy document to your ser-
                 vice role specified by ServiceAccessRoleArn . The default  is
                 false .

          RedshiftSettings -> (structure)
              Settings for the Amazon Redshift endpoint.

              AcceptAnyDate -> (boolean)
                 A  value  that  indicates to allow any date format, including
                 invalid formats such as 00/00/00 00:00:00, to be loaded with-
                 out  generating  an  error. You can choose true or false (the
                 default).

                 This parameter applies only to TIMESTAMP  and  DATE  columns.
                 Always  use  ACCEPTANYDATE  with the DATEFORMAT parameter. If
                 the date format for the data  doesn't  match  the  DATEFORMAT
                 specification, Amazon Redshift inserts a NULL value into that
                 field.

              AfterConnectScript -> (string)
                 Code to run after connecting. This parameter  should  contain
                 the  code itself, not the name of a file containing the code.

              BucketFolder -> (string)
                 An S3 folder where the comma-separated-value (.csv) files are
                 stored  before being uploaded to the target Redshift cluster.

                 For full load mode, DMS converts  source  records  into  .csv
                 files  and  loads  them to the BucketFolder/TableID path. DMS
                 uses the Redshift COPY command to upload the  .csv  files  to
                 the  target table. The files are deleted once the COPY opera-
                 tion has finished. For more information, see COPY in the Ama-
                 zon Redshift Database Developer Guide .

                 For  change-data-capture (CDC) mode, DMS creates a NetChanges
                 table,  and  loads   the   .csv   files   to   this   Bucket-
                 Folder/NetChangesTableID path.

              BucketName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  intermediate S3 bucket used to store .csv
                 files before uploading data to Redshift.

              CaseSensitiveNames -> (boolean)
                 If Amazon Redshift is configured to  support  case  sensitive
                 schema names, set CaseSensitiveNames to true . The default is
                 false .

              CompUpdate -> (boolean)
                 If you set CompUpdate to true Amazon Redshift  applies  auto-
                 matic compression if the table is empty. This applies even if
                 the table columns already have encodings other than RAW .  If
                 you  set  CompUpdate to false , automatic compression is dis-
                 abled and  existing  column  encodings  aren't  changed.  The
                 default is true .

              ConnectionTimeout -> (integer)
                 A  value  that  sets the amount of time to wait (in millisec-
                 onds) before timing out, beginning from  when  you  initially
                 establish a connection.

              DatabaseName -> (string)
                 The name of the Amazon Redshift data warehouse (service) that
                 you are working with.

              DateFormat -> (string)
                 The date format that you are using.  Valid  values  are  auto
                 (case-sensitive), your date format string enclosed in quotes,
                 or NULL. If this parameter is left unset (NULL), it  defaults
                 to  a  format  of  'YYYY-MM-DD'.  Using  auto recognizes most
                 strings, even some that aren't supported when you use a  date
                 format string.

                 If  your date and time values use formats different from each
                 other, set this to auto .

              EmptyAsNull -> (boolean)
                 A value that specifies whether DMS should migrate empty  CHAR
                 and  VARCHAR  fields as NULL. A value of true sets empty CHAR
                 and VARCHAR fields to null. The default is false .

              EncryptionMode -> (string)
                 The type of server-side encryption that you want to  use  for
                 your  data. This encryption type is part of the endpoint set-
                 tings or the extra connections attributes for Amazon S3.  You
                 can choose either SSE_S3 (the default) or SSE_KMS .

                 NOTE:
                     For  the  ModifyEndpoint  operation,  you  can change the
                     existing  value  of  the  EncryptionMode  parameter  from
                     SSE_KMS  to  SSE_S3  .  But  you cant change the existing
                     value from SSE_S3 to SSE_KMS .

                 To use SSE_S3 , create  an  Identity  and  Access  Management
                 (IAM)  role with a policy that allows "arn:aws:s3:::*" to use
                 the following actions: "s3:PutObject", "s3:ListBucket"

              ExplicitIds -> (boolean)
                 This setting is only valid for a  full-load  migration  task.
                 Set  ExplicitIds to true to have tables with IDENTITY columns
                 override their auto-generated  values  with  explicit  values
                 loaded  from  the  source  data  files  used  to populate the
                 tables. The default is false .

              FileTransferUploadStreams -> (integer)
                 The number of threads used to  upload  a  single  file.  This
                 parameter  accepts  a value from 1 through 64. It defaults to
                 10.

                 The number of parallel streams used to upload a  single  .csv
                 file  to  an  S3  bucket  using S3 Multipart Upload. For more
                 information, see Multipart upload overview .
                     FileTransferUploadStreams accepts a value from 1  through
                     64. It defaults to 10.

              LoadTimeout -> (integer)
                 The  amount  of  time to wait (in milliseconds) before timing
                 out of operations performed by DMS  on  a  Redshift  cluster,
                 such as Redshift COPY, INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE.

              MaxFileSize -> (integer)
                 The  maximum  size (in KB) of any .csv file used to load data
                 on an S3 bucket and transfer  data  to  Amazon  Redshift.  It
                 defaults to 1048576KB (1 GB).

              Password -> (string)
                 The password for the user named in the username property.

              Port -> (integer)
                 The  port  number  for  Amazon Redshift. The default value is
                 5439.

              RemoveQuotes -> (boolean)
                 A value that specifies to remove surrounding quotation  marks
                 from  strings in the incoming data. All characters within the
                 quotation marks, including delimiters, are  retained.  Choose
                 true to remove quotation marks. The default is false .

              ReplaceInvalidChars -> (string)
                 A  list  of  characters  that  you  want to replace. Use with
                 ReplaceChars .

                 the iam:PassRole action.

              ServerSideEncryptionKmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The KMS key ID. If you are using SSE_KMS for the  Encryption-
                 Mode  ,  provide  this  key ID. The key that you use needs an
                 attached policy that enables IAM user permissions and  allows
                 use of the key.

              TimeFormat -> (string)
                 The  time  format that you want to use. Valid values are auto
                 (case-sensitive),  'timeformat_string'  ,  'epochsecs'  ,  or

                 most strings, even some that aren't supported when you use  a
                 time format string.

                 If  your date and time values use formats different from each
                 other, set this parameter to auto .

                 A value that specifies to remove  the  trailing  white  space
                 characters from a VARCHAR string. This parameter applies only
                 to columns with a VARCHAR data type. Choose  true  to  remove
                 unneeded white space. The default is false .

              TruncateColumns -> (boolean)
                 A  value  that  specifies  to truncate data in columns to the
                 appropriate number of characters, so that the  data  fits  in
                 the  column.  This  parameter  applies only to columns with a
                 VARCHAR or CHAR data type, and rows with a size of  4  MB  or
                 less. Choose true to truncate data. The default is false .

                 generating .csv files on the local disk at the  DMS  replica-
                 tion  instance.  The  default  value  is 1000 (buffer size is
                 1000KB).

              SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the  IAM  role  that
                 specifies  DMS  as the trusted entity and grants the required
                 permissions to access the value in SecretsManagerSecret . The
                 role must allow the iam:PassRole action. SecretsManagerSecret
                 has the value of the  Amazon  Web  Services  Secrets  Manager
                 secret that allows access to the Amazon Redshift endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     You  can specify one of two sets of values for these per-
                     missions. You can specify the values for this setting and
                     SecretsManagerSecretId  .  Or  you can specify clear-text
                     values for UserName , Password , ServerName , and Port  .
                     You  can't specify both. For more information on creating
                     this SecretsManagerSecret and  the  SecretsManagerAccess-
                     RoleArn and SecretsManagerSecretId required to access it,
                     see Using secrets to access  Database  Migration  Service
                     resources  in the Database Migration Service User Guide .

              SecretsManagerSecretId -> (string)
                 The full ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of  the  Secrets-
                 ManagerSecret that contains the Amazon Redshift endpoint con-
                 nection details.

          PostgreSQLSettings -> (structure)
              The settings for the PostgreSQL source and target endpoint.  For
              more information, see the PostgreSQLSettings structure.

              AfterConnectScript -> (string)
                 For  use  with change data capture (CDC) only, this attribute
                 has DMS bypass foreign keys and user triggers to  reduce  the
                 time it takes to bulk load data.

                 Example:        afterConnectScript=SET       session_replica-
                 tion_role='replica'

              CaptureDdls -> (boolean)
                 To capture DDL events, DMS creates various artifacts  in  the
                 PostgreSQL  database  when  the  task  starts.  You can later
                 remove these artifacts.

                 If this value is set to N , you don't have to  create  tables
                 or triggers on the source database.

              MaxFileSize -> (integer)
                 Specifies  the  maximum size (in KB) of any .csv file used to
                 transfer data to PostgreSQL.

                 Example: maxFileSize=512

              DatabaseName -> (string)
                 Database name for the endpoint.

              DdlArtifactsSchema -> (string)
                 The schema in which the operational  DDL  database  artifacts
                 are created.

                 Example: ddlArtifactsSchema=xyzddlschema;

              ExecuteTimeout -> (integer)
                 Sets   the   client  statement  timeout  for  the  PostgreSQL
                 instance, in seconds. The default value is 60 seconds.

                 Example: executeTimeout=100;

              FailTasksOnLobTruncation -> (boolean)
                 When set to true , this value causes a task to  fail  if  the
                 actual  size  of  a  LOB column is greater than the specified
                 LobMaxSize .

                 If task is set to Limited LOB mode and this option is set  to
                 true, the task fails instead of truncating the LOB data.

              HeartbeatEnable -> (boolean)
                 The  write-ahead  log  (WAL) heartbeat feature mimics a dummy
                 transaction. By doing this, it prevents idle logical replica-
                 tion  slots  from holding onto old WAL logs, which can result
                 in storage full situations  on  the  source.  This  heartbeat
                 keeps restart_lsn moving and prevents storage full scenarios.

              HeartbeatSchema -> (string)
                 Sets the schema in which the heartbeat artifacts are created.

              HeartbeatFrequency -> (integer)
                 Sets the WAL heartbeat frequency (in minutes).

              Password -> (string)
                 Endpoint connection password.

              Port -> (integer)
                 Endpoint TCP port. The default is 5432.

              ServerName -> (string)
                 Fully qualified domain name of the endpoint.

              Username -> (string)
                 Endpoint connection user name.

              SlotName -> (string)
                 Sets  the  name  of  a previously created logical replication
                 slot for a change data capture (CDC) load of  the  PostgreSQL
                 source instance.

                 When used with the CdcStartPosition request parameter for the
                 DMS API , this attribute also makes it possible to use native
                 CDC  start  points.  DMS  verifies that the specified logical
                 replication slot exists before starting the CDC load task. It
                 also  verifies that the task was created with a valid setting
                 of CdcStartPosition . If the specified slot doesn't exist  or
                 the  task  doesn't have a valid CdcStartPosition setting, DMS
                 raises an error.

                 For  more  information  about  setting  the  CdcStartPosition
                 request  parameter,  see Determining a CDC native start point
                 in the Database Migration  Service  User  Guide  .  For  more
                 information    about    using    CdcStartPosition    ,    see
                 CreateReplicationTask   ,    StartReplicationTask    ,    and
                 ModifyReplicationTask .

              PluginName -> (string)
                 Specifies the plugin to use to create a replication slot.

              SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The  full  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the IAM role that
                 specifies DMS as the trusted entity and grants  the  required
                 permissions to access the value in SecretsManagerSecret . The
                 role must allow the iam:PassRole action. SecretsManagerSecret
                 has  the  value  of  the  Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager
                 secret that allows access to the PostgreSQL endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     You can specify one of two sets of values for these  per-
                     missions. You can specify the values for this setting and
                     SecretsManagerSecretId . Or you  can  specify  clear-text
                     values  for UserName , Password , ServerName , and Port .
                     You can't specify both. For more information on  creating
                     this  SecretsManagerSecret  and the SecretsManagerAccess-
                     RoleArn and SecretsManagerSecretId required to access it,
                     see  Using  secrets  to access Database Migration Service
                     resources in the Database Migration Service User Guide  .

              SecretsManagerSecretId -> (string)
                 The  full  ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of the Secrets-
                 ManagerSecret that contains the PostgreSQL  endpoint  connec-
                 tion details.

          MySQLSettings -> (structure)
              The  settings for the MySQL source and target endpoint. For more
              information, see the MySQLSettings structure.

              AfterConnectScript -> (string)
                 Specifies a script to run immediately after DMS  connects  to
                 the endpoint. The migration task continues running regardless
                 if the SQL statement succeeds or fails.

                 For this parameter, provide the code of  the  script  itself,
                 not the name of a file containing the script.

              CleanSourceMetadataOnMismatch -> (boolean)
                 Adjusts the behavior of DMS when migrating from an SQL Server
                 source database that is hosted as part of an Always On avail-
                 ability  group cluster. If you need DMS to poll all the nodes
                 in the Always On cluster for transaction  backups,  set  this
                 attribute to false .

              DatabaseName -> (string)
                 Database  name for the endpoint. For a MySQL source or target
                 endpoint, don't explicitly specify  the  database  using  the
                 DatabaseName  request  parameter on either the CreateEndpoint
                 or ModifyEndpoint API call. Specifying DatabaseName when  you
                 create  or  modify  a  MySQL endpoint replicates all the task
                 tables to this single  database.  For  MySQL  endpoints,  you
                 specify  the database only when you specify the schema in the
                 table-mapping rules of the DMS task.

              EventsPollInterval -> (integer)
                 Specifies  how  often  to  check  the  binary  log  for   new
                 changes/events when the database is idle. The default is five
                 seconds.

                 Example: eventsPollInterval=5;

                 In the example, DMS checks for changes  in  the  binary  logs
                 every five seconds.

              TargetDbType -> (string)
                 Specifies  where  to  migrate  source  tables  on the target,
                 either to a single database or multiple databases.

                 Example: targetDbType=MULTIPLE_DATABASES

              MaxFileSize -> (integer)
                 Specifies the maximum size (in KB) of any .csv file  used  to
                 transfer data to a MySQL-compatible database.

                 Example: maxFileSize=512

              ParallelLoadThreads -> (integer)
                 Improves performance when loading data into the MySQL-compat-
                 ible target database. Specifies how many threads  to  use  to
                 load the data into the MySQL-compatible target database. Set-
                 ting a large number of threads can have an adverse effect  on
                 database   performance,  because  a  separate  connection  is
                 required for each thread. The default is one.

                 Example: parallelLoadThreads=1

              Password -> (string)
                 Endpoint connection password.

              Port -> (integer)
                 Endpoint TCP port.

              ServerName -> (string)
                 Fully qualified domain name of the endpoint.

              ServerTimezone -> (string)
                 Specifies the time zone for the source MySQL database.

                 Example: serverTimezone=US/Pacific;

                 Note: Do not enclose time zones in single quotes.

              Username -> (string)
                 Endpoint connection user name.

              SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the  IAM  role  that
                 specifies  DMS  as the trusted entity and grants the required
                 permissions to access the value in SecretsManagerSecret . The
                 role must allow the iam:PassRole action. SecretsManagerSecret
                 has the value of the  Amazon  Web  Services  Secrets  Manager
                 secret that allows access to the MySQL endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     You  can specify one of two sets of values for these per-
                     missions. You can specify the values for this setting and
                     SecretsManagerSecretId  .  Or  you can specify clear-text
                     values for UserName , Password , ServerName , and Port  .
                     You  can't specify both. For more information on creating
                     this SecretsManagerSecret and  the  SecretsManagerAccess-
                     RoleArn and SecretsManagerSecretId required to access it,
                     see Using secrets to access  Database  Migration  Service
                     resources  in the Database Migration Service User Guide .

              SecretsManagerSecretId -> (string)
                 The full ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of  the  Secrets-
                 ManagerSecret  that  contains  the  MySQL endpoint connection
                 details.

          OracleSettings -> (structure)
              The settings for the Oracle source and target endpoint. For more
              information, see the OracleSettings structure.

              AddSupplementalLogging -> (boolean)
                 Set this attribute to set up table-level supplemental logging
                 for the Oracle database. This attribute enables  PRIMARY  KEY
                 supplemental  logging  on all tables selected for a migration
                 task.

                 If you use this  option,  you  still  need  to  enable  data-
                 base-level supplemental logging.

              ArchivedLogDestId -> (integer)
                 Specifies  the  ID  of  the destination for the archived redo
                 logs. This value should be  the  same  as  a  number  in  the
                 dest_id  column  of the v$archived_log view. If you work with
                 an  additional  redo  log  destination,  use  the   Addition-
                 alArchivedLogDestId option to specify the additional destina-
                 tion ID. Doing this improves performance by ensuring that the
                 correct logs are accessed from the outset.

              AdditionalArchivedLogDestId -> (integer)
                 Set  this  attribute  with  ArchivedLogDestId  in  a primary/
                 standby setup. This attribute is useful  in  the  case  of  a
                 switchover. In this case, DMS needs to know which destination
                 to get archive redo logs from  to  read  changes.  This  need
                 arises because the previous primary instance is now a standby
                 instance after switchover.

                 Although DMS supports the use of the Oracle RESETLOGS  option
                 to  open  the database, never use RESETLOGS unless necessary.
                 For additional information about RESETLOGS ,  see  RMAN  Data
                 Repair  Concepts  in  the Oracle Database Backup and Recovery
                 User's Guide .

              ExtraArchivedLogDestIds -> (list)
                 Specifies the IDs of one more destinations for  one  or  more
                 archived  redo  logs. These IDs are the values of the dest_id
                 column in the v$archived_log view. Use this setting with  the
                 archivedLogDestId   extra  connection  attribute  in  a  pri-
                 mary-to-single setup or a primary-to-multiple-standby  setup.

                 This setting is useful in a switchover when you use an Oracle
                 Data Guard database as a source.  In  this  case,  DMS  needs
                 information  about  what destination to get archive redo logs
                 from to read  changes.  DMS  needs  this  because  after  the
                 switchover  the  previous  primary is a standby instance. For
                 example, in a primary-to-single standby setup you might apply
                 the following settings.
                     archivedLogDestId=1; ExtraArchivedLogDestIds=[2]

                 In  a  primary-to-multiple-standby setup, you might apply the
                 following settings.
                     archivedLogDestId=1; ExtraArchivedLogDestIds=[2,3,4]

                 Although DMS supports the use of the Oracle RESETLOGS  option
                 to  open the database, never use RESETLOGS unless it's neces-
                 sary. For more information about RESETLOGS ,  see  RMAN  Data
                 Repair  Concepts  in  the Oracle Database Backup and Recovery
                 User's Guide .

                 (integer)

              AllowSelectNestedTables -> (boolean)
                 Set this attribute to true to enable  replication  of  Oracle
                 tables  containing  columns that are nested tables or defined
                 types.

              ParallelAsmReadThreads -> (integer)
                 Set this attribute to change the number of threads  that  DMS
                 configures  to perform a change data capture (CDC) load using
                 Oracle Automatic Storage Management (ASM). You can specify an
                 integer  value  between  2 (the default) and 8 (the maximum).
                 Use  this  attribute  together   with   the   readAheadBlocks
                 attribute.

              ReadAheadBlocks -> (integer)
                 Set  this attribute to change the number of read-ahead blocks
                 that DMS configures to perform a change  data  capture  (CDC)
                 load using Oracle Automatic Storage Management (ASM). You can
                 specify an integer  value  between  1000  (the  default)  and
                 200,000 (the maximum).

              AccessAlternateDirectly -> (boolean)
                 Set this attribute to false in order to use the Binary Reader
                 to capture change data for an Amazon RDS for  Oracle  as  the
                 source.  This  tells the DMS instance to not access redo logs
                 through any specified path prefix  replacement  using  direct
                 file access.

              UseAlternateFolderForOnline -> (boolean)
                 Set  this attribute to true in order to use the Binary Reader
                 to capture change data for an Amazon RDS for  Oracle  as  the
                 source. This tells the DMS instance to use any specified pre-
                 fix replacement to access all online redo logs.

              OraclePathPrefix -> (string)
                 Set this string attribute to the required value in  order  to
                 use  the  Binary  Reader to capture change data for an Amazon
                 RDS for Oracle  as  the  source.  This  value  specifies  the
                 default Oracle root used to access the redo logs.

              UsePathPrefix -> (string)
                 Set  this  string attribute to the required value in order to
                 use the Binary Reader to capture change data  for  an  Amazon
                 RDS  for  Oracle as the source. This value specifies the path
                 prefix used to replace the default Oracle root to access  the
                 redo logs.

              ReplacePathPrefix -> (boolean)
                 Set  this attribute to true in order to use the Binary Reader
                 to capture change data for an Amazon RDS for  Oracle  as  the
                 source.  This  setting  tells  DMS  instance  to  replace the
                 default Oracle root with the specified usePathPrefix  setting
                 to access the redo logs.

              EnableHomogenousTablespace -> (boolean)
                 Set  this  attribute to enable homogenous tablespace replica-
                 tion and create existing tables or  indexes  under  the  same
                 tablespace on the target.

              DirectPathNoLog -> (boolean)
                 When  set to true , this attribute helps to increase the com-
                 mit rate on the Oracle target database by writing directly to
                 tables and not writing a trail to database logs.

              ArchivedLogsOnly -> (boolean)
                 When  this field is set to Y , DMS only accesses the archived
                 redo logs. If the archived redo logs are stored on Oracle ASM
                 only,  the  DMS  user  account needs to be granted ASM privi-
                 leges.

              AsmPassword -> (string)
                 For an Oracle source endpoint, your Oracle Automatic  Storage
                 Management (ASM) password. You can set this value from the ``
                 asm_user_password `` value. You set this value as part of the
                 comma-separated  value  that  you set to the Password request
                 parameter when you create the endpoint to access  transaction
                 logs   using   Binary   Reader.  For  more  information,  see
                 Configuration for change data  capture  (CDC)  on  an  Oracle
                 source database .

              AsmServer -> (string)
                 For  an  Oracle source endpoint, your ASM server address. You
                 can set  this  value  from  the  asm_server  value.  You  set
                 asm_server  as  part of the extra connection attribute string
                 to access an Oracle server with Binary Reader that uses  ASM.
                 For  more information, see Configuration for change data cap-
                 ture (CDC) on an Oracle source database .

              AsmUser -> (string)
                 For an Oracle source endpoint, your ASM user  name.  You  can
                 set  this  value from the asm_user value. You set asm_user as
                 part of the extra connection attribute string  to  access  an
                 Oracle  server  with  Binary  Reader  that uses ASM. For more
                 information, see Configuration for change data capture  (CDC)
                 on an Oracle source database .

              CharLengthSemantics -> (string)
                 Specifies  whether  the  length  of  a character column is in
                 bytes or in characters. To indicate that the character column
                 length  is in characters, set this attribute to CHAR . Other-
                 wise, the character column length is in bytes.

                 Example: charLengthSemantics=CHAR;

              DatabaseName -> (string)
                 Database name for the endpoint.

              DirectPathParallelLoad -> (boolean)
                 When set to true , this attribute specifies a  parallel  load
                 when  useDirectPathFullLoad is set to Y . This attribute also
                 only applies when you use the DMS parallel load feature. Note
                 that the target table cannot have any constraints or indexes.

              FailTasksOnLobTruncation -> (boolean)
                 When set to true , this attribute causes a task  to  fail  if
                 the  actual  size of an LOB column is greater than the speci-
                 fied LobMaxSize .

                 If a task is set to limited LOB mode and this option  is  set
                 to  true , the task fails instead of truncating the LOB data.

              NumberDatatypeScale -> (integer)
                 Specifies the number scale. You can select a scale up to  38,
                 or  you can select FLOAT. By default, the NUMBER data type is
                 converted to precision 38, scale 10.

                 Example: numberDataTypeScale=12

              Password -> (string)
                 Endpoint connection password.

              Port -> (integer)
                 Endpoint TCP port.

              ReadTableSpaceName -> (boolean)
                 When set to true , this attribute supports tablespace  repli-
                 cation.

              RetryInterval -> (integer)
                 Specifies  the number of seconds that the system waits before
                 resending a query.

                 Example: retryInterval=6;

              SecurityDbEncryption -> (string)
                 For an Oracle source endpoint, the transparent  data  encryp-
                 tion (TDE) password required by AWM DMS to access Oracle redo
                 logs encrypted by TDE using Binary Reader. It is also the  ``
                 TDE_Password  `` part of the comma-separated value you set to
                 the Password request parameter when you create the  endpoint.
                 The SecurityDbEncryptian setting is related to this Security-
                 DbEncryptionName setting. For more information, see Supported
                 encryption  methods  for  using Oracle as a source for DMS in
                 the Database Migration Service User Guide .

              SecurityDbEncryptionName -> (string)
                 For an Oracle source endpoint, the name of a key used for the
                 transparent   data   encryption  (TDE)  of  the  columns  and
                 tablespaces in an Oracle source database  that  is  encrypted
                 using  TDE.  The  key value is the value of the SecurityDbEn-
                 cryption setting. For more information  on  setting  the  key
                 name  value of SecurityDbEncryptionName , see the information
                 and example for setting  the  securityDbEncryptionName  extra
                 connection  attribute  in  Supported  encryption  methods for
                 using Oracle as a source for DMS in  the  Database  Migration
                 Service User Guide .

              ServerName -> (string)
                 Fully qualified domain name of the endpoint.

              SpatialDataOptionToGeoJsonFunctionName -> (string)
                 Use this attribute to convert SDO_GEOMETRY to GEOJSON format.
                 By default, DMS calls  the  SDO2GEOJSON  custom  function  if
                 present  and  accessible.  Or  you can create your own custom
                 function that mimics the operation of SDOGEOJSON and set Spa-
                 tialDataOptionToGeoJsonFunctionName to call it instead.

              StandbyDelayTime -> (integer)
                 Use this attribute to specify a time in minutes for the delay
                 in standby sync. If the source is an Oracle Active Data Guard
                 standby  database, use this attribute to specify the time lag
                 between primary and standby databases.

                 In DMS, you can create an Oracle CDC task that uses an Active
                 Data Guard standby instance as a source for replicating ongo-
                 ing changes. Doing this eliminates the need to connect to  an
                 active database that might be in production.

              Username -> (string)
                 Endpoint connection user name.

              UseBFile -> (boolean)
                 Set  this  attribute  to  Y  to capture change data using the
                 Binary Reader utility. Set UseLogminerReader to N to set this
                 attribute to Y. To use Binary Reader with Amazon RDS for Ora-
                 cle as the source, you set additional  attributes.  For  more
                 information  about  using  this setting with Oracle Automatic
                 Storage Management (ASM), see Using Oracle  LogMiner  or  DMS
                 Binary Reader for CDC .

              UseDirectPathFullLoad -> (boolean)
                 Set  this  attribute  to Y to have DMS use a direct path full
                 load. Specify this value to use the direct path  protocol  in
                 the  Oracle Call Interface (OCI). By using this OCI protocol,
                 you can bulk-load Oracle target tables during a full load.

              UseLogminerReader -> (boolean)
                 Set this attribute to Y to capture change data using the Ora-
                 cle  LogMiner  utility (the default). Set this attribute to N
                 if you want to access the redo logs as a  binary  file.  When
                 you  set  UseLogminerReader to N, also set UseBfile to Y. For
                 more information on this setting and using  Oracle  ASM,  see
                 Using Oracle LogMiner or DMS Binary Reader for CDC in the DMS
                 User Guide .

              SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the  IAM  role  that
                 specifies  DMS  as the trusted entity and grants the required
                 permissions to access the value in SecretsManagerSecret . The
                 role must allow the iam:PassRole action. SecretsManagerSecret
                 has the value of the  Amazon  Web  Services  Secrets  Manager
                 secret that allows access to the Oracle endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     You  can specify one of two sets of values for these per-
                     missions. You can specify the values for this setting and
                     SecretsManagerSecretId  .  Or  you can specify clear-text
                     values for UserName , Password , ServerName , and Port  .
                     You  can't specify both. For more information on creating
                     this SecretsManagerSecret and  the  SecretsManagerAccess-
                     RoleArn and SecretsManagerSecretId required to access it,
                     see Using secrets to access  Database  Migration  Service
                     resources  in the Database Migration Service User Guide .

              SecretsManagerSecretId -> (string)
                 The full ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of  the  Secrets-
                 ManagerSecret  that  contains  the Oracle endpoint connection
                 details.

              SecretsManagerOracleAsmAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 Required only if your Oracle endpoint uses  Advanced  Storage
                 Manager  (ASM).  The  full ARN of the IAM role that specifies
                 DMS as the trusted entity and grants the required permissions
                 to  access  the SecretsManagerOracleAsmSecret . This Secrets-
                 ManagerOracleAsmSecret  has  the  secret  value  that  allows
                 access to the Oracle ASM of the endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     You  can specify one of two sets of values for these per-
                     missions. You can specify the values for this setting and
                     SecretsManagerOracleAsmSecretId  .  Or  you  can  specify
                     clear-text values for AsmUserName  ,  AsmPassword  ,  and
                     AsmServerName . You can't specify both. For more informa-

                     the  SecretsManagerOracleAsmAccessRoleArn and SecretsMan-
                     agerOracleAsmSecretId required to access  it,  see  Using
                     secrets to access Database Migration Service resources in
                     the Database Migration Service User Guide .

              SecretsManagerOracleAsmSecretId -> (string)
                 Required only if your Oracle endpoint uses  Advanced  Storage
                 Manager (ASM). The full ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of
                 the SecretsManagerOracleAsmSecret that  contains  the  Oracle
                 ASM connection details for the Oracle endpoint.

          SybaseSettings -> (structure)
              The  settings  for  the  SAP ASE source and target endpoint. For
              more information, see the SybaseSettings structure.

                 Endpoint connection password.

              Port -> (integer)
                 Endpoint TCP port. The default is 5000.

              ServerName -> (string)
                 Fully qualified domain name of the endpoint.

              Username -> (string)
                 Endpoint connection user name.

              SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the  IAM  role  that
                 specifies  DMS  as the trusted entity and grants the required
                 permissions to access the value in SecretsManagerSecret . The
                 role must allow the iam:PassRole action. SecretsManagerSecret
                 has the value of the  Amazon  Web  Services  Secrets  Manager
                 secret that allows access to the SAP ASE endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     You  can specify one of two sets of values for these per-
                     missions. You can specify the values for this setting and
                     SecretsManagerSecretId  .  Or  you can specify clear-text
                     values for UserName , Password , ServerName , and Port  .
                     You  can't specify both. For more information on creating
                     this SecretsManagerSecret and  the  SecretsManagerAccess-
                     RoleArn and SecretsManagerSecretId required to access it,
                     see Using secrets to access  Database  Migration  Service
                     resources  in the Database Migration Service User Guide .

              SecretsManagerSecretId -> (string)
                 The full ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of  the  Secrets-
                 ManagerSecret  that  contains the SAP SAE endpoint connection
                 details.

          MicrosoftSQLServerSettings -> (structure)
              The settings for the Microsoft SQL Server source and target end-
              point.  For more information, see the MicrosoftSQLServerSettings
              structure.

              Port -> (integer)
                 Endpoint TCP port.

              BcpPacketSize -> (integer)
                 The maximum size of the packets (in bytes) used  to  transfer
                 data using BCP.

              DatabaseName -> (string)
                 Database name for the endpoint.

              ControlTablesFileGroup -> (string)
                 Specifies  a file group for the DMS internal tables. When the
                 replication task starts, all the internal DMS control  tables
                 (
                 awsdms_
                  apply_exception,  awsdms_apply,  awsdms_changes) are created
                 for the specified file group.

              Password -> (string)
                 Endpoint connection password.

              QuerySingleAlwaysOnNode -> (boolean)
                 Cleans and recreates table metadata information on the repli-
                 cation instance when a mismatch occurs. An example is a situ-
                 ation where running an alter DDL statement on a  table  might
                 result in different information about the table cached in the
                 replication instance.

              ReadBackupOnly -> (boolean)
                 When this attribute is set to Y , DMS only reads changes from
                 transaction  log  backups  and  doesn't  read from the active
                 transaction log file during ongoing replication. Setting this
                 parameter  to Y enables you to control active transaction log
                 file growth during full load and ongoing  replication  tasks.
                 However,  it  can add some source latency to ongoing replica-
                 tion.

              SafeguardPolicy -> (string)
                 Use this attribute to minimize the need to access the  backup
                 log  and  enable  DMS  to prevent truncation using one of the
                 following two methods.
                     Start transactions in the database: This is  the  default
                     method. When this method is used, DMS prevents TLOG trun-
                     cation by mimicking a transaction  in  the  database.  As
                     long  as  such a transaction is open, changes that appear
                     after the transaction started aren't  truncated.  If  you
                     need  Microsoft  Replication  to be enabled in your data-
                     base, then you must choose this method.

                     Exclusively use sp_repldone within a single task  :  When
                     this  method is used, DMS reads the changes and then uses
                     sp_repldone to mark the TLOG transactions  as  ready  for
                     truncation.  Although  this  method  doesn't  involve any
                     transactional  activities,  it  can  only  be  used  when
                     Microsoft  Replication  isn't  running.  Also, when using
                     this method, only one DMS task can access the database at
                     any  given  time.  Therefore, if you need to run parallel
                     DMS tasks against the  same  database,  use  the  default
                     method.

              ServerName -> (string)
                 Fully qualified domain name of the endpoint.

              SslSecurityProtocol -> (string)
                 The  connection  to  a  Redis target endpoint using Transport
                 Layer Security (TLS).  Valid  values  include  plaintext  and
                 ssl-encryption   .   The  default  is  ssl-encryption  .  The
                 ssl-encryption option makes an encrypted connection.  Option-
                 ally,  you  can identify an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for an
                 SSL certificate authority (CA) using the  SslCaCertificateArn
                 setting.  If an ARN isn't given for a CA, DMS uses the Amazon
                 root CA.

                 The plaintext option doesn't provide Transport Layer Security
                 (TLS) encryption for traffic between endpoint and database.

              AuthType -> (string)
                 The  type  of  authentication to perform when connecting to a
                 Redis  target.  Options  include  none  ,  auth-token  ,  and
                 auth-role  .  The  auth-token option requires an AuthPassword
                 value to be provided. The auth-role option requires AuthUser-
                 Name and AuthPassword values to be provided.

              AuthUserName -> (string)
                 The  user  name  provided  with  the  auth-role option of the
                 AuthType setting for a Redis target endpoint.

              AuthPassword -> (string)
                 The password  provided  with  the  auth-role  and  auth-token
                 options  of the AuthType setting for a Redis target endpoint.

              SslCaCertificateArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the certificate  authority
                 (CA)  that DMS uses to connect to your Redis target endpoint.

          GcpMySQLSettings -> (structure)
              Settings in JSON format for the source GCP MySQL endpoint.

              AfterConnectScript -> (string)
                 Specifies a script to run immediately after DMS  connects  to
                 the endpoint. The migration task continues running regardless
                 if the SQL statement succeeds or fails.

                 For this parameter, provide the code of  the  script  itself,
                 not the name of a file containing the script.

              CleanSourceMetadataOnMismatch -> (boolean)
                 Adjusts the behavior of DMS when migrating from an SQL Server
                 source database that is hosted as part of an Always On avail-
                 ability  group cluster. If you need DMS to poll all the nodes
                 in the Always On cluster for transaction  backups,  set  this
                 attribute to false .

              DatabaseName -> (string)
                 Database  name for the endpoint. For a MySQL source or target
                 endpoint, don't explicitly specify  the  database  using  the
                 DatabaseName  request  parameter on either the CreateEndpoint
                 or ModifyEndpoint API call. Specifying DatabaseName when  you
                 create  or  modify  a  MySQL endpoint replicates all the task
                 tables to this single  database.  For  MySQL  endpoints,  you
                 specify  the database only when you specify the schema in the
                 table-mapping rules of the DMS task.

              EventsPollInterval -> (integer)
                 Specifies  how  often  to  check  the  binary  log  for   new
                 changes/events when the database is idle. The default is five
                 seconds.

                 Example: eventsPollInterval=5;

                 In the example, DMS checks for changes  in  the  binary  logs
                 every five seconds.

              TargetDbType -> (string)
                 Specifies  where  to  migrate  source  tables  on the target,
                 either to a single database or multiple databases.

                 Example: targetDbType=MULTIPLE_DATABASES

              MaxFileSize -> (integer)
                 Specifies the maximum size (in KB) of any .csv file  used  to
                 transfer data to a MySQL-compatible database.

                 Example: maxFileSize=512

              ParallelLoadThreads -> (integer)
                 Improves performance when loading data into the MySQL-compat-
                 ible target database. Specifies how many threads  to  use  to
                 load the data into the MySQL-compatible target database. Set-
                 ting a large number of threads can have an adverse effect  on
                 database   performance,  because  a  separate  connection  is
                 required for each thread. The default is one.

                 Example: parallelLoadThreads=1

              Password -> (string)
                 Endpoint connection password.

              Port -> (integer)

              ServerName -> (string)
                 Endpoint TCP port.

              ServerTimezone -> (string)
                 Specifies the time zone for the source MySQL database.

                 Example: serverTimezone=US/Pacific;

                 Note: Do not enclose time zones in single quotes.

              Username -> (string)
                 Endpoint connection user name.

              SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the  IAM  role  that
                 specifies  DMS  as the trusted entity and grants the required
                 permissions to access the value in SecretsManagerSecret.  The
                 role must allow the iam:PassRole action. SecretsManagerSecret
                 has the value of the  Amazon  Web  Services  Secrets  Manager
                 secret that allows access to the MySQL endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     You  can specify one of two sets of values for these per-
                     missions. You can specify the values for this setting and
                     SecretsManagerSecretId  .  Or  you can specify clear-text
                     values for UserName , Password , ServerName , and Port  .
                     You  can't specify both. For more information on creating
                     this SecretsManagerSecret and  the  SecretsManagerAccess-
                     RoleArn and SecretsManagerSecretId required to access it,
