SYNOPSIS
            start-replication-task
          --replication-task-arn <value>
          --start-replication-task-type <value>
          [--cdc-start-time <value>]
          [--cdc-start-position <value>]
          [--cdc-stop-position <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --replication-task-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the  replication  task  to  be
          started.

       --start-replication-task-type (string)
          The type of replication task to start.

          When the migration type is full-load or full-load-and-cdc , the only
          valid value for the first run of the task is start-replication . You
          use  reload-target  to  restart  the  task  and resume-processing to
          resume the task.

          When the migration type is cdc , you use start-replication to  start
          or  restart  the  task,  and  resume-processing  to resume the task.
          reload-target is not a valid value for a task with migration type of
          cdc .

          Possible values:

          o start-replication

          o resume-processing

          o reload-target

       --cdc-start-time (timestamp)
          Indicates  the start time for a change data capture (CDC) operation.
          Use either CdcStartTime or CdcStartPosition to specify when you want
          a  CDC  operation  to  start.  Specifying  both values results in an
          error.

          Timestamp Example: --cdc-start-time 2018-03-08T12:12:12

       --cdc-start-position (string)
          Indicates when you want a change data  capture  (CDC)  operation  to
          start.  Use  either CdcStartPosition or CdcStartTime to specify when
          you want a CDC operation to start. Specifying both values results in
          an error.

          The value can be in date, checkpoint, or LSN/SCN format.

          Date Example: --cdc-start-position 2018-03-08T12:12:12

          Checkpoint        Example:        --cdc-start-position       "check-
          point:V1#27#mysql-bin-changelog.157832:1975:-1:2002:677883278264080:mysql-bin-changelog.157832:1876#0#0#*#0#93"

          LSN Example: --cdc-start-position mysql-bin-changelog.000024:373

          NOTE:
              When  you  use  this task setting with a source PostgreSQL data-
              base, a logical replication slot should already be  created  and
              associated with the source endpoint. You can verify this by set-
              ting the slotName extra connection attribute to the name of this
              logical  replication  slot. For more information, see Extra Con-
              nection Attributes When Using PostgreSQL as a Source for DMS .

       --cdc-stop-position (string)
          Indicates when you want a change data  capture  (CDC)  operation  to
          stop. The value can be either server time or commit time.

          Server           time          example:          --cdc-stop-position
          server_time:2018-02-09T12:12:12

          Commit    time     example:     --cdc-stop-position     commit_time:
          2018-02-09T12:12:12

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun.html`__
                 is  an improved premigration task assessment operation. The `
                 StartReplicationTaskAssessment
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTaskAssessment.html`__
                 operation assesses data type compatibility only  between  the
                 source and target database of a given migration task. In con-
                 trast,          `           StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun.html`__
                 enables you to specify a variety of premigration task assess-
                 ments  in  addition to data type compatibility. These assess-
                 ments include ones for the validity of  primary  key  defini-
                 tions  and likely issues with database migration performance,
                 among others.

          LastFailureMessage -> (string)
              The last error (failure) message generated for  the  replication
              task.

          StopReason -> (string)
              The  reason  the  replication  task  was  stopped. This response
              parameter can return one of the following values:

              o "STOP_REASON_FULL_LOAD_COMPLETED"   Full-load  migration  com-
                pleted.

              o "STOP_REASON_CACHED_CHANGES_APPLIED"    Change   data  capture
                (CDC) load completed.

              o "STOP_REASON_CACHED_CHANGES_NOT_APPLIED"  In a  full-load  and
                CDC  migration,  the  full  load  stopped  as specified before
                starting the CDC migration.

              o "STOP_REASON_SERVER_TIME"  The migration stopped at the speci-
                fied server time.

          ReplicationTaskCreationDate -> (timestamp)
              The date the replication task was created.

          ReplicationTaskStartDate -> (timestamp)
              The date the replication task is scheduled to start.

          CdcStartPosition -> (string)
              Indicates when you want a change data capture (CDC) operation to
              start. Use either CdcStartPosition or  CdcStartTime  to  specify
              when you want the CDC operation to start. Specifying both values
              results in an error.

              The value can be in date, checkpoint, or LSN/SCN format.

              Date Example: --cdc-start-position 2018-03-08T12:12:12

              Checkpoint      Example:      --cdc-start-position       "check-

          CdcStopPosition -> (string)
              Indicates when you want a change data capture (CDC) operation to
              stop. The value can be either server time or commit time.

              Server         time         example:         --cdc-stop-position
              server_time:2018-02-09T12:12:12

          RecoveryCheckpoint -> (string)
              Indicates the last checkpoint that occurred during a change data
              capture  (CDC) operation. You can provide this value to the Cdc-
              StartPosition parameter to start a CDC operation that begins  at
              that checkpoint.

          ReplicationTaskArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the replication task.

                 start or a target reload.

              StartDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date the replication task was started either with a fresh

              data for certain source and target endpoints. For more  informa-
              tion,  see Specifying Supplemental Data for Task Settings in the
              Database Migration Service User Guide.

          TargetReplicationInstanceArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the replication instance to which this task is  moved
