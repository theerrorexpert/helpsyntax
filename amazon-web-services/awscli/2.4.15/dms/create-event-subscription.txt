CREATE-EVENT-SUBSCRIPTION()                        CREATE-EVENT-SUBSCRIPTION()



NAME
       create-event-subscription -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an DMS event notification subscription.

       You  can  specify the type of source (SourceType ) you want to be noti-
       fied of, provide a list of DMS source IDs (SourceIds  )  that  triggers
       the  events,  and provide a list of event categories (EventCategories )
       for events you want to be notified of. If you specify both the  Source-
       Type  and  SourceIds  ,  such  as SourceType = replication-instance and
       SourceIdentifier = my-replinstance , you will be notified  of  all  the
       replication  instance events for the specified source. If you specify a
       SourceType but don't specify a SourceIdentifier , you receive notice of
       the  events for that source type for all your DMS sources. If you don't
       specify either SourceType nor SourceIdentifier , you will  be  notified
       of  events  generated  from  all DMS sources belonging to your customer
       account.

       For more information about DMS events,  see  Working  with  Events  and
       Notifications in the Database Migration Service User Guide.

SYNOPSIS
            create-event-subscription
          --subscription-name <value>
          --sns-topic-arn <value>
          [--source-type <value>]
          [--event-categories <value>]
          [--source-ids <value>]
          [--enabled | --no-enabled]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subscription-name (string)
          The  name of the DMS event notification subscription. This name must
          be less than 255 characters.

       --sns-topic-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic  created  for
          event notification. The ARN is created by Amazon SNS when you create
          a topic and subscribe to it.

       --source-type (string)
          The type of DMS resource that generates the events. For example,  if
          you  want  to  be  notified  of  events  generated  by a replication
          instance, you set this parameter to replication-instance .  If  this
          value isn't specified, all events are returned.

          Valid values: replication-instance | replication-task

       --event-categories (list)
          A  list  of event categories for a source type that you want to sub-
          scribe to. For more information, see Working with Events and Notifi-
          cations in the Database Migration Service User Guide.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --source-ids (list)
          A list of identifiers for which DMS provides notification events.

          If  you  don't  specify  a value, notifications are provided for all
          sources.

          If you specify multiple values, they must be of the same  type.  For
          example,  if  you  specify  a  database instance ID, then all of the
          other values must be database instance IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --enabled | --no-enabled (boolean)
          A Boolean value; set to true to activate the subscription, or set to
          false to create the subscription but not activate it.

       --tags (list)
          One or more tags to be assigned to the event subscription.

          (structure)
              A  user-defined  key-value pair that describes metadata added to
              an DMS resource and that is used by operations such as the  fol-
              lowing:

              o AddTagsToResource

              o ListTagsForResource

              o RemoveTagsFromResource

              Key -> (string)
                 A  key  is the required name of the tag. The string value can
                 be 1-128 Unicode characters in length and can't  be  prefixed
                 with  "aws:"  or "dms:". The string can only contain only the
                 set of Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_',  '.',  '/',
                 '=',      '+',     '-'     (Java     regular     expressions:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A value is the optional value of the tag.  The  string  value
                 can  be  1-256 Unicode characters in length and can't be pre-
                 fixed with "aws:" or "dms:". The string can only contain only
                 the  set  of  Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_', '.',
                 '/',   '=',   '+',    '-'    (Java    regular    expressions:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) string that uniquely identi-
                 fies the resource for which the tag is created.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string,ResourceArn=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string",
              "ResourceArn": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list event subscriptions

       The following create-event-subscription example creates an  event  sub-
       scription to an Amazon SNS topic (my-sns-topic).

          aws dms create-event-subscription \
              --subscription-name my-dms-events \
              --sns-topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:my-sns-topic

       Output:

          {
              "EventSubscription": {
                  "CustomerAwsId": "123456789012",
                  "CustSubscriptionId": "my-dms-events",
                  "SnsTopicArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:my-sns-topic",
                  "Status": "creating",
                  "SubscriptionCreationTime": "2020-05-21 21:58:38.598",
                  "Enabled": true
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       EventSubscription -> (structure)
          The event subscription that was created.

          CustomerAwsId -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services customer account associated with the DMS
              event notification subscription.

          CustSubscriptionId -> (string)
              The DMS event notification subscription Id.

          SnsTopicArn -> (string)
              The topic ARN of the DMS event notification subscription.

          Status -> (string)

              active | no-permission | topic-not-exist

              The status "no-permission" indicates that DMS no longer has per-
              mission  to  post to the SNS topic. The status "topic-not-exist"
              indicates that the topic was deleted after the subscription  was
              created.

              Valid  values: replication-instance | replication-server | secu-
              rity-group | replication-task

          SourceIdsList -> (list)
              A list of source Ids for the event subscription.

              (string)

          EventCategoriesList -> (list)
