GET-COMPATIBLE-VERSIONS()                            GET-COMPATIBLE-VERSIONS()



NAME
       get-compatible-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of upgrade-compatible versions of OpenSearch/Elastic-
       search. You can  optionally  pass  a  ``   DomainName  ``  to  get  all
       upgrade-compatible  versions  of OpenSearch/Elasticsearch for that spe-
       cific domain.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-compatible-versions
          [--domain-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The name of an domain. Domain names are unique  across  the  domains
          owned  by an account within an AWS region. Domain names start with a
          letter or number and can contain the following characters: a-z (low-
          ercase), 0-9, and - (hyphen).

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CompatibleVersions -> (list)
          A  map  of compatible OpenSearch versions returned as part of the ``
          GetCompatibleVersions `` operation.

          (structure)
              A map from an ``  EngineVersion `` to a list  of  compatible  ``
              EngineVersion `` s to which the domain can be upgraded.

              SourceVersion -> (string)
                 The current version of OpenSearch a domain is on.

              TargetVersions -> (list)
                 List of supported OpenSearch versions.

                 (string)
