       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            upgrade-domain
          --domain-name <value>
          --target-version <value>
          [--perform-check-only | --no-perform-check-only]
          [--advanced-options <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The name of an domain. Domain names are unique  across  the  domains
          owned  by an account within an AWS region. Domain names start with a
          letter or number and can contain the following characters: a-z (low-
          ercase), 0-9, and - (hyphen).

       --target-version (string)
          The version of OpenSearch you intend to upgrade the domain to.

       --perform-check-only | --no-perform-check-only (boolean)
          When  true,  indicates that an upgrade eligibility check needs to be
          performed. Does not actually perform the upgrade.

       --advanced-options (map)
          Exposes  select  native   OpenSearch   configuration   values   from
          opensearch.yml  .  Currently,  the  following  advanced  options are
          available:

          o Option to allow references to indices in  an  HTTP  request  body.
            Must be false when configuring access to individual sub-resources.
            By default, the value is true . See  Advanced  cluster  parameters
            for more information.

          o Option  to specify the percentage of heap space allocated to field
            data. By default, this setting is unbounded.

          For more information, see Advanced cluster parameters .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       UpgradeId -> (string)

       DomainName -> (string)
          The name of an domain. Domain names are unique  across  the  domains
          owned  by an account within an AWS region. Domain names start with a
          letter or number and can contain the following characters: a-z (low-
          ercase), 0-9, and - (hyphen).

       TargetVersion -> (string)
          The  version of OpenSearch that you intend to upgrade the domain to.

          When true, indicates that an upgrade eligibility check needs  to  be
          performed. Does not actually perform the upgrade.

       AdvancedOptions -> (map)
          Exposes   select   native   OpenSearch   configuration  values  from
