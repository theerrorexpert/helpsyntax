OPTIONS
       --local-domain-info (structure)
          The ``  AWSDomainInformation `` for the local OpenSearch domain.

          AWSDomainInformation -> (structure)
              OwnerId -> (string)

              DomainName -> (string)
                 The name of an domain. Domain names  are  unique  across  the
                 domains  owned  by  an  account  within an AWS region. Domain
                 names start with a letter or number and can contain the  fol-
                 lowing characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and - (hyphen).

              Region -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AWSDomainInformation={OwnerId=string,DomainName=string,Region=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AWSDomainInformation": {
              "OwnerId": "string",
              "DomainName": "string",
              "Region": "string"
            }
          }

       --remote-domain-info (structure)
          The ``  AWSDomainInformation `` for the remote OpenSearch domain.

          AWSDomainInformation -> (structure)
              OwnerId -> (string)

              DomainName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  an  domain. Domain names are unique across the
                 domains owned by an account  within  an  AWS  region.  Domain
                 names  start with a letter or number and can contain the fol-
                 lowing characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and - (hyphen).

              Region -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AWSDomainInformation={OwnerId=string,DomainName=string,Region=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AWSDomainInformation": {
              "OwnerId": "string",
              "DomainName": "string",
              "Region": "string"
            }
          }

       --connection-alias (string)
          The connection alias used used by the customer for this  cross-clus-
          ter connection.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
