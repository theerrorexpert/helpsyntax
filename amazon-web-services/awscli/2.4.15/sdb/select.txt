SELECT()                                                              SELECT()



NAME
       select -

DESCRIPTION
       The  Select  operation  returns  a set of attributes for ItemNames that
       match the select expression. Select is  similar  to  the  standard  SQL
       SELECT statement.

       The total size of the response cannot exceed 1 MB in total size. Amazon
       SimpleDB automatically adjusts the number of items returned per page to
       enforce  this  limit.  For example, if the client asks to retrieve 2500
       items, but each individual item is 10 kB in size,  the  system  returns
       100  items  and  an  appropriate NextToken so the client can access the
       next page of results.

       For information on how  to  construct  select  expressions,  see  Using
       Select to Create Amazon SimpleDB Queries in the Developer Guide.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       select  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in
       order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagi-
       nation  by  providing  the --no-paginate argument.  When using --output
       text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the  --query
       argument  must  extract  data  from  the results of the following query
       expressions: Items

SYNOPSIS
            select
          --select-expression <value>
          [--consistent-read | --no-consistent-read]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --select-expression (string) The expression used to query the domain.

       --consistent-read | --no-consistent-read (boolean)  Determines  whether
       or  not  strong  consistency  should be enforced when data is read from
       SimpleDB. If true , any data previously written  to  SimpleDB  will  be
       returned.  Otherwise,  results  will  be consistent eventually, and the
       client may not see data that was written immediately before your  read.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Items -> (list)

          (structure)
              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the item.

              AlternateNameEncoding -> (string)

              Attributes -> (list)

                 (structure)
                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the attribute.

                     AlternateNameEncoding -> (string)

                     Value -> (string)

          tion time exceeded 5 seconds.
