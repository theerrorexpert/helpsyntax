GET-ATTRIBUTES()                                              GET-ATTRIBUTES()



NAME
       get-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  all  of  the  attributes  associated  with the specified item.
       Optionally, the attributes returned can  be  limited  to  one  or  more
       attributes by specifying an attribute name parameter.

       If  the  item  does not exist on the replica that was accessed for this
       operation, an empty set is returned. The  system  does  not  return  an
       error as it cannot guarantee the item does not exist on other replicas.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-attributes
          --domain-name <value>
          --item-name <value>
          [--attribute-names <value>]
          [--consistent-read | --no-consistent-read]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string) The name of the domain in which to  perform  the
       operation.

       --item-name (string) The name of the item.

       --attribute-names (list) The names of the attributes.(string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --consistent-read  |  --no-consistent-read (boolean) Determines whether
       or not strong consistency should be enforced when  data  is  read  from
       SimpleDB.  If  true  ,  any data previously written to SimpleDB will be
       returned. Otherwise, results will be  consistent  eventually,  and  the
       client  may not see data that was written immediately before your read.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Attributes -> (list)
          The list of attributes returned by the operation.

          (structure)
              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the attribute.

              AlternateNameEncoding -> (string)

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the attribute.

              AlternateValueEncoding -> (string)
