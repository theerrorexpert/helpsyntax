STOP-BULK-DEPLOYMENT()                                  STOP-BULK-DEPLOYMENT()



NAME
       stop-bulk-deployment -

DESCRIPTION
       Stops  the execution of a bulk deployment. This action returns a status
       of ''Stopping'' until the deployment is stopped. You cannot start a new
       bulk  deployment  while  a  previous  deployment is in the ''Stopping''
       state. This action doesn't rollback  completed  deployments  or  cancel
       pending deployments.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            stop-bulk-deployment
          --bulk-deployment-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bulk-deployment-id (string) The ID of the bulk deployment.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       receive  an  error:  InvalidInputException: Cannot change state of fin-
       ished execution.
