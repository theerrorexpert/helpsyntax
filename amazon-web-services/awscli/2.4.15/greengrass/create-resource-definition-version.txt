          [--amzn-client-token <value>]
          --resource-definition-id <value>
          [--resources <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --amzn-client-token (string) A client token used to correlate  requests
       and responses.

       --resource-definition-id (string) The ID of the resource definition.

       --resources (list) A list of resources.(structure)
          Information about a resource.

          Id -> (string)
              The resource ID, used to refer to a resource in the Lambda func-
              tion configuration. Max length is 128  characters  with  pattern
              ''[a-zA-Z0-9:_-]+''.  This  must  be  unique within a Greengrass
              group.

          Name -> (string)
              The descriptive resource name, which is displayed on the AWS IoT
              Greengrass  console.  Max  length  128  characters  with pattern
              ''[a-zA-Z0-9:_-]+''. This must be  unique  within  a  Greengrass
              group.

              A container of data for all resource types.

              LocalDeviceResourceData -> (structure)

                        specified Linux OS group owner of the resource to  the
                        Lambda  process  privileges.  Thus  the Lambda process
                        will have the file access  permissions  of  the  added
                        Linux group.

                     GroupOwner -> (string)
                        The  name  of the Linux OS group whose privileges will

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       Arn -> (string)
          The ARN of the version.

       CreationTimestamp -> (string)

          ated.

       Id -> (string)
