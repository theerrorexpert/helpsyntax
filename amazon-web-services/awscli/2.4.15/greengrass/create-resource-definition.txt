CREATE-RESOURCE-DEFINITION()                      CREATE-RESOURCE-DEFINITION()



NAME
       create-resource-definition -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a resource definition which contains a list of resources to be
       used in a group. You can create an initial version of the definition by
       providing  a  list of resources now, or use ''CreateResourceDefinition-
       Version'' later.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --amzn-client-token (string) A client token used to correlate  requests
       and responses.

       --initial-version  (structure) Information about the initial version of
       the resource definition.Resources -> (list)
          A list of resources.

          (structure)
              Information about a resource.

              Id -> (string)
                 The resource ID, used to refer to a resource  in  the  Lambda
                 function  configuration.  Max  length  is 128 characters with
                 pattern ''[a-zA-Z0-9:_-]+''. This must  be  unique  within  a
                 Greengrass group.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  descriptive resource name, which is displayed on the AWS
                 IoT Greengrass console. Max length 128 characters  with  pat-
                 tern ''[a-zA-Z0-9:_-]+''. This must be unique within a Green-
                 grass group.

              ResourceDataContainer -> (structure)
                 A container of data for all resource types.

                 LocalDeviceResourceData -> (structure)
                     Attributes that define the local device resource.

                     GroupOwnerSetting -> (structure)

                        AutoAddGroupOwner -> (boolean)
                            If true, AWS IoT Greengrass automatically adds the
                            specified  Linux OS group owner of the resource to
                            the Lambda process  privileges.  Thus  the  Lambda
                            process  will  have the file access permissions of
                            the added Linux group.

                        GroupOwner -> (string)
                            The name of the Linux OS  group  whose  privileges
                            will be added to the Lambda process. This field is
                            optional.

                     SourcePath -> (string)
                        The local absolute path of the  device  resource.  The
                        source  path for a device resource can refer only to a
                        character device or block device under ''/dev''.

                     Attributes that define the local volume resource.

                     DestinationPath -> (string)
                        The absolute local path of  the  resource  inside  the
                        Lambda environment.

                     GroupOwnerSetting -> (structure)
                        Allows  you  to  configure additional group privileges
                        for the Lambda process. This field is optional.

                        AutoAddGroupOwner -> (boolean)
                            If true, AWS IoT Greengrass automatically adds the
                            specified  Linux OS group owner of the resource to
                            the Lambda process  privileges.  Thus  the  Lambda
                            process  will  have the file access permissions of
                            the added Linux group.

                        GroupOwner -> (string)
                            The name of the Linux OS  group  whose  privileges
                            will be added to the Lambda process. This field is
                            optional.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To create a resource definition

       The following create-resource-definition  example  creates  a  resource
       definition that contains a list of resources to be used in a Greengrass
       group. In this example, an initial version of the  resource  definition
       is  included  by  providing  a list of resources. The list includes one
       resource for a Twilio authorization token and  the  ARN  for  a  secret
       stored  in  AWS  Secrets Manager. You must create the secret before you
       can create the resource definition.

          aws greengrass create-resource-definition \
              --name MyGreengrassResources \
              --initial-version "{\"Resources\": [{\"Id\": \"TwilioAuthToken\",\"Name\": \"MyTwilioAuthToken\",\"ResourceDataContainer\": {\"SecretsManagerSecretResourceData\": {\"ARN\": \"arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:greengrass-TwilioAuthToken-ntSlp6\"}}}]}"

       Output:

          {
              "Arn": "arn:aws:greengrass:us-west-2:123456789012:/greengrass/definition/resources/c8bb9ebc-c3fd-40a4-9c6a-568d75569d38",
              "CreationTimestamp": "2019-06-19T21:51:28.212Z",
              "Id": "c8bb9ebc-c3fd-40a4-9c6a-568d75569d38",
              "LastUpdatedTimestamp": "2019-06-19T21:51:28.212Z",
              "LatestVersion": "a5f94d0b-f6bc-40f4-bb78-7a1c5fe13ba1",
              "LatestVersionArn": "arn:aws:greengrass:us-west-2:123456789012:/greengrass/definition/resources/c8bb9ebc-c3fd-40a4-9c6a-568d75569d38/versions/a5f94d0b-f6bc-40f4-bb78-7a1c5fe13ba1",
              "Name": "MyGreengrassResources"
          }
