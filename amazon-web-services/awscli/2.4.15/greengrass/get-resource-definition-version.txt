GET-RESOURCE-DEFINITION-VERSION()            GET-RESOURCE-DEFINITION-VERSION()



NAME
       get-resource-definition-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information  about  a resource definition version, including
       which resources are included in the version.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-resource-definition-version
          --resource-definition-id <value>
          --resource-definition-version-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-definition-id (string) The ID of the resource definition.

       --resource-definition-version-id (string) The ID of the resource  defi-
       nition version. This value maps to the ''Version'' property of the cor-
       responding  ''VersionInformation''  object,  which   is   returned   by
       ''ListResourceDefinitionVersions'' requests. If the version is the last
       one that was associated with a resource definition, the value also maps
       to  the ''LatestVersion'' property of the corresponding ''DefinitionIn-
       formation'' object.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve information about a specific version of a resource  defini-
       tion

       The  following get-resource-definition-version example retrieves infor-
       mation about the specified version of the  specified  resource  defini-
       tion.  To  retrieve the IDs of all versions of the resource definition,
       use the list-resource-definition-versions command. To retrieve  the  ID
       of  the  last  version  added  to  the  resource  definition,  use  the
       get-resource-definition command and check the LatestVersion property.
