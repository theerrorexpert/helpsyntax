NAME
       list-connector-definition-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the versions of a connector definition, which are containers for
       connectors. Connectors run on the Greengrass core and contain  built-in
       integration with local infrastructure, device protocols, AWS, and other
       cloud services.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-connector-definition-versions is a paginated  operation.  Multiple
       API  calls  may  be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: Versions

SYNOPSIS
            list-connector-definition-versions
          --connector-definition-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --connector-definition-id  (string) The ID of the connector definition.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (string)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (string)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the versions that are available for a connector definition

       The following list-connector-definition-versions example lists the ver-
       sions that are available for the specified  connector  definition.  Use
       the  list-connector-definitions command to get the connector definition
       ID.

          aws greengrass list-connector-definition-versions \
              --connector-definition-id "b5c4ebfd-f672-49a3-83cd-31c7216a7bb8"

       Output:

          {
              "Versions": [
                  {
                      "Arn": "arn:aws:greengrass:us-west-2:123456789012:/greengrass/definition/connectors/b5c4ebfd-f672-49a3-83cd-31c7216a7bb8/versions/63c57963-c7c2-4a26-a7e2-7bf478ea2623",
                      "CreationTimestamp": "2019-06-19T19:30:01.300Z",
                      "Id": "b5c4ebfd-f672-49a3-83cd-31c7216a7bb8",
                      "Version": "63c57963-c7c2-4a26-a7e2-7bf478ea2623"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Versions -> (list)
          Information about a version.

          (structure)
