GET-ASSOCIATED-ROLE()                                    GET-ASSOCIATED-ROLE()



NAME
       get-associated-role -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the role associated with a particular group.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-associated-role
          --group-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --group-id (string) The ID of the Greengrass group.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the role associated with a Greengrass group

       The  following  get-associated-role  example  gets  the IAM role that's
       associated with the specified Greengrass group. The group role is  used
       by local Lambda functions and connectors to access AWS services.

          aws greengrass get-associated-role \
              --group-id 2494ee3f-7f8a-4e92-a78b-d205f808b84b

       Output:

          {
              "RoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/GG-Group-Role",
              "AssociatedAt": "2019-09-10T20:03:30Z"
          }

       For  more  information,  see  Configure  the  Group Role in the AWS IoT
       Greengrass Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       AssociatedAt -> (string)
          The time when the role was associated with the group.

       RoleArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the role that is associated with the group.
