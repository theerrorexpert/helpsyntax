NAME
       change-server-life-cycle-state -

DESCRIPTION
       Allows  the  user  to set the SourceServer.LifeCycle.state property for
       specific Source Server IDs to one of the following:  READY_FOR_TEST  or
       READY_FOR_CUTOVER.  This  command  only  works  if the Source Server is
       already launchable (dataReplicationInfo.lagDuration is not null.)

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            change-server-life-cycle-state
          --life-cycle <value>
          --source-server-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --life-cycle (structure)
          The request to change the source server migration lifecycle state.

          state -> (string)
              The request to change  the  source  server  migration  lifecycle
              state.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          state=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "state": "READY_FOR_TEST"|"READY_FOR_CUTOVER"|"CUTOVER"
          }

       --source-server-id (string)
          The request to change the source server migration lifecycle state by
          source server ID.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
