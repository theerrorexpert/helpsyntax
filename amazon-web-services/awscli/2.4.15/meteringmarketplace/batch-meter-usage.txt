BATCH-METER-USAGE()                                        BATCH-METER-USAGE()



NAME
       batch-meter-usage -

DESCRIPTION
       BatchMeterUsage  is  called  from  a SaaS application listed on the AWS
       Marketplace to post metering records for a set of customers.

       For identical requests, the API is idempotent; requests can be  retried
       with the same records or a subset of the input records.

       Every  request  to  BatchMeterUsage  is for one product. If you need to
       meter usage for multiple products, you  must  make  multiple  calls  to
       BatchMeterUsage.

       BatchMeterUsage can process up to 25 UsageRecords at a time.

       A  UsageRecord  can  optionally  include multiple usage allocations, to
       provide customers with usagedata split into buckets by  tags  that  you
       define (or allow the customer to define).

       BatchMeterUsage requests must be less than 1MB in size.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-meter-usage
          --usage-records <value>
          --product-code <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --usage-records (list)
          The  set of UsageRecords to submit. BatchMeterUsage accepts up to 25
          UsageRecords at a time.

          (structure)
              A UsageRecord indicates a quantity of usage for a given product,
              customer, dimension and time.

              Multiple  requests  with  the same UsageRecords as input will be
              deduplicated to prevent double charges.

              Timestamp -> (timestamp)
                 Timestamp, in UTC, for which the usage is being reported.

                 Your application can meter usage for up to one  hour  in  the
                 past.  Make  sure the timestamp value is not before the start
                 of the software usage.

              CustomerIdentifier -> (string)
                 The CustomerIdentifier is obtained  through  the  ResolveCus-
                 tomer  operation  and  represents an individual buyer in your
                 application.

              Dimension -> (string)
                 During the process of registering a product  on  AWS  Market-
                 place,  up to eight dimensions are specified. These represent
                 different units of value in your application.

              Quantity -> (integer)
                 The quantity of usage consumed by the customer for the  given
                 dimension and time. Defaults to 0 if not specified.

              UsageAllocations -> (list)
                 The  set  of  UsageAllocations  to  submit.  The  sum  of all
                 UsageAllocation quantities must equal  the  Quantity  of  the
                 UsageRecord.

                 (structure)
                     Usage  allocations  allow you to split usage into buckets
                     by tags.

                     Each UsageAllocation indicates the usage quantity  for  a
                     specific set of tags.

                     AllocatedUsageQuantity -> (integer)
                        The  total quantity allocated to this bucket of usage.

                     Tags -> (list)
                        The set of tags that define the bucket of  usage.  For
                        the  bucket  of items with no tags, this parameter can
                        be left out.

                        (structure)
                            Metadata assigned to an allocation.  Each  tag  is
                            made up of a key and a value.

                            Key -> (string)
                               One  part  of  a key-value pair that makes up a
                               tag. A key is a label that acts like a category
                               for the specific tag values.

                            Value -> (string)
                               One  part  of  a key-value pair that makes up a
                               tag. A value acts as a descriptor within a  tag
                               category (key). The value can be empty or null.

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Timestamp": timestamp,
              "CustomerIdentifier": "string",
              "Dimension": "string",
              "Quantity": integer,
              "UsageAllocations": [
                {
                  "AllocatedUsageQuantity": integer,
                  "Tags": [
                    {
                      "Key": "string",
                      "Value": "string"
                    }
                    ...
                  ]
                }
                ...
              ]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --product-code (string)
          Product code is used to uniquely identify a product in  AWS  Market-
          place.  The  product  code should be the same as the one used during
          the publishing of a new product.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          were invalid.

          (structure)
              A UsageRecordResult indicates the status of a given  UsageRecord
              processed by BatchMeterUsage.

              UsageRecord -> (structure)
                 The UsageRecord that was part of the BatchMeterUsage request.

                 Timestamp -> (timestamp)

                     the past. Make sure the timestamp value is not before the
                     start of the software usage.

                 CustomerIdentifier -> (string)
                     The  CustomerIdentifier  is obtained through the Resolve-
                     Customer operation and represents an individual buyer  in
                     your application.

                 Dimension -> (string)
                     During  the  process of registering a product on AWS Mar-
                     ketplace, up to eight  dimensions  are  specified.  These
                     represent different units of value in your application.

                 Quantity -> (integer)
                     The  quantity  of  usage consumed by the customer for the
                     given dimension and time. Defaults to 0 if not specified.

                 UsageAllocations -> (list)

                     UsageAllocation quantities must equal the Quantity of the
                     UsageRecord.

                     (structure)
                        Usage  allocations allow you to split usage into buck-
                        ets by tags.

                        Each UsageAllocation indicates the usage quantity  for
                        a specific set of tags.

                        AllocatedUsageQuantity -> (integer)

                        Tags -> (list)
                            The set of tags that define the bucket  of  usage.
                            For the bucket of items with no tags, this parame-
                            ter can be left out.

                            (structure)
                               Metadata assigned to an allocation. Each tag is
                               made up of a key and a value.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   One  part of a key-value pair that makes up
                                   a tag. A key is a label that  acts  like  a
                                   category for the specific tag values.

                                   a  tag  category  (key).  The  value can be
                                   empty or null.

              MeteringRecordId -> (string)
                 The MeteringRecordId is a unique identifier for this metering
                 event.

              Status -> (string)
                 The UsageRecordResult Status indicates the status of an indi-
                 vidual UsageRecord processed by BatchMeterUsage.

                 o Success - The  UsageRecord  was  accepted  and  honored  by
                   BatchMeterUsage.

                 o CustomerNotSubscribed - The CustomerIdentifier specified is
                   not subscribed to your product.  The  UsageRecord  was  not
                   honored.  Future  UsageRecords  for this customer will fail
                   until the customer subscribes to your product.

                 o DuplicateRecord  -  Indicates  that  the  UsageRecord   was
                   invalid  and  not honored. A previously metered UsageRecord
                   had the same customer, dimension, and time, but a different
                   quantity.

       UnprocessedRecords -> (list)
          Contains  all  UsageRecords  that  were  not  processed  by BatchMe-
          terUsage. This is a list of UsageRecords. You can retry  the  failed
          request  by  making  another  BatchMeterUsage call with this list as
          input in the BatchMeterUsageRequest.

          (structure)
              A UsageRecord indicates a quantity of usage for a given product,
              customer, dimension and time.

              Multiple  requests  with  the same UsageRecords as input will be
              deduplicated to prevent double charges.

              Timestamp -> (timestamp)
                 Timestamp, in UTC, for which the usage is being reported.

                 Your application can meter usage for up to one  hour  in  the
                 past.  Make  sure the timestamp value is not before the start
                 of the software usage.

              CustomerIdentifier -> (string)
                 The CustomerIdentifier is obtained  through  the  ResolveCus-
                 tomer  operation  and  represents an individual buyer in your
                 application.

              Dimension -> (string)
                 During the process of registering a product  on  AWS  Market-
                 place,  up to eight dimensions are specified. These represent
                 different units of value in your application.

              Quantity -> (integer)
                 The quantity of usage consumed by the customer for the  given
                 dimension and time. Defaults to 0 if not specified.

              UsageAllocations -> (list)
                 The  set  of  UsageAllocations  to  submit.  The  sum  of all
                 UsageAllocation quantities must equal  the  Quantity  of  the
                 UsageRecord.

                 (structure)
                     Usage  allocations  allow you to split usage into buckets
                     by tags.

                     Each UsageAllocation indicates the usage quantity  for  a
                     specific set of tags.

                     AllocatedUsageQuantity -> (integer)
                        The  total quantity allocated to this bucket of usage.

                     Tags -> (list)
                        The set of tags that define the bucket of  usage.  For
                        the  bucket  of items with no tags, this parameter can
                        be left out.

                        (structure)
                            Metadata assigned to an allocation.  Each  tag  is
                            made up of a key and a value.

                            Key -> (string)
                               One  part  of  a key-value pair that makes up a
                               tag. A key is a label that acts like a category
                               for the specific tag values.

                            Value -> (string)
                               One  part  of  a key-value pair that makes up a
                               tag. A value acts as a descriptor within a  tag
                               category (key). The value can be empty or null.
