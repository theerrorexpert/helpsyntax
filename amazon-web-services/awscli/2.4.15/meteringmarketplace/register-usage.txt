REGISTER-USAGE()                                              REGISTER-USAGE()



NAME
       register-usage -

DESCRIPTION
       Paid  container  software  products  sold  through AWS Marketplace must
       integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and call the Regis-
       terUsage operation for software entitlement and metering. Free and BYOL
       products for Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS aren't required  to  call  Regis-
       terUsage,  but  you  may  choose  to do so if you would like to receive
       usage data in your seller  reports.  The  sections  below  explain  the
       behavior  of  RegisterUsage.  RegisterUsage  performs two primary func-
       tions: metering and entitlement.

       o Entitlement : RegisterUsage allows you to verify  that  the  customer
         running  your paid software is subscribed to your product on AWS Mar-
         ketplace, enabling you to guard against unauthorized use.  Your  con-
         tainer  image  that integrates with RegisterUsage is only required to
         guard against unauthorized use at container startup, as such  a  Cus-
         tomerNotSubscribedException/PlatformNotSupportedException  will  only
         be thrown on the initial call to RegisterUsage. Subsequent calls from
         the  same  Amazon  ECS task instance (e.g. task-id) or Amazon EKS pod
         will not throw a CustomerNotSubscribedException, even if the customer
         unsubscribes  while  the  Amazon  ECS task or Amazon EKS pod is still
         running.

       o Metering : RegisterUsage meters software use per ECS task, per  hour,
         or  per pod for Amazon EKS with usage prorated to the second. A mini-
         mum of 1 minute of usage applies to tasks that are short  lived.  For
         example, if a customer has a 10 node Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS cluster
         and a service configured as a Daemon Set, then Amazon ECS  or  Amazon
         EKS  will launch a task on all 10 cluster nodes and the customer will
         be charged: (10 * hourly_rate). Metering for software use is automat-
         ically  handled by the AWS Marketplace Metering Control Plane -- your
         software is not required to perform any  metering  specific  actions,
         other  than  call  RegisterUsage once for metering of software use to
         commence. The AWS Marketplace Metering Control Plane will  also  con-
         tinue  to  bill  customers for running ECS tasks and Amazon EKS pods,
         regardless of the customers subscription state, removing the need for
         your software to perform entitlement checks at runtime.

SYNOPSIS
            register-usage
          --product-code <value>
          --public-key-version <value>
          [--nonce <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --product-code (string)
          Product  code  is used to uniquely identify a product in AWS Market-
          place. The product code should be the same as the  one  used  during
          the publishing of a new product.

       --public-key-version (integer)
          Public Key Version provided by AWS Marketplace

       --nonce (string)
          (Optional)  To  scope  down  the  registration to a specific running
          software instance and guard against replay attacks.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PublicKeyRotationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
          (Optional) Only included when public key version has expired

       Signature -> (string)
          JWT Token
