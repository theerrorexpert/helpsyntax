RESOLVE-CUSTOMER()                                          RESOLVE-CUSTOMER()



NAME
       resolve-customer -

DESCRIPTION
       ResolveCustomer is called by a SaaS application during the registration
       process. When a buyer  visits  your  website  during  the  registration
       process,  the buyer submits a registration token through their browser.
       The registration token is resolved through this API to  obtain  a  Cus-
       tomerIdentifier and product code.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            resolve-customer
          --registration-token <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --registration-token (string)
          When  a  buyer  visits your website during the registration process,
          the buyer submits a registration token through the browser. The reg-
          istration token is resolved to obtain a CustomerIdentifier and prod-
          uct code.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CustomerIdentifier -> (string)
          The CustomerIdentifier is used to identify an individual customer in
          your  application.  Calls to BatchMeterUsage require CustomerIdenti-
          fiers for each UsageRecord.

       ProductCode -> (string)
          The product code is returned to confirm that the buyer is  register-
          ing  for  your  product.  Subsequent BatchMeterUsage calls should be
          made using this product code.
