GENERATE-DATA-SET()                                        GENERATE-DATA-SET()



NAME
       generate-data-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Given  a  data  set  type and data set publication date, asynchronously
       publishes the requested data set to the specified S3 bucket  and  noti-
       fies  the  specified  SNS  topic  once the data is available. Returns a
       unique request identifier that can be used to correlate  requests  with
       notifications  from  the  SNS  topic.  Data  sets  will be published in
       comma-separated   values   (CSV)   format   with    the    file    name
       {data_set_type}_YYYY-MM-DD.csv.  If  a  file with the same name already
       exists (e.g. if the same data set is  requested  twice),  the  original
       file  will  be  overwritten  by  the  new file. Requires a Role with an
       attached permissions policy providing Allow permissions for the follow-
       ing   actions:   s3:PutObject,   s3:GetBucketLocation,  sns:GetTopicAt-
       tributes, sns:Publish, iam:GetRolePolicy.

       --data-set-publication-date (timestamp) The date a data  set  was  pub-
       lished.  For daily data sets, provide a date with day-level granularity
       for the desired day. For monthly data sets  except  those  with  prefix
       disbursed_amount,  provide  a date with month-level granularity for the
       desired month (the day value will be ignored). For data sets with  pre-
       fix disbursed_amount, provide a date with day-level granularity for the
       desired day. For these data sets we will look backwards  in  time  over
       the  range  of  31  days  until the first data set is found (the latest
       one).

       --role-name-arn (string) The Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the  Role
       with  an  attached permissions policy to interact with the provided AWS
       services.

       --destination-s3-bucket-name (string) The name (friendly name, not ARN)
       of the destination S3 bucket.

       --destination-s3-prefix  (string)  (Optional) The desired S3 prefix for
       the published data set, similar to a directory path  in  standard  file
       systems.  For example, if given the bucket name "mybucket" and the pre-
       fix "myprefix/mydatasets", the output file "outputfile" would  be  pub-
       lished to "s3://mybucket/myprefix/mydatasets/outputfile". If the prefix
       directory structure does not exist, it will be created. If no prefix is
       provided, the data set will be published to the S3 bucket root.

       --sns-topic-arn  (string)  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the SNS Topic
       that will be notified when the data set has been  published  or  if  an
       error has occurred.

       --customer-defined-values  (map)  (Optional) Key-value pairs which will
       be returned, unmodified, in the Amazon SNS notification message and the
       data set metadata file. These key-value pairs can be used to correlated
       responses with tracking information from other systems.key -> (string)
          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       dataSetRequestId -> (string)
          A unique identifier representing a specific request to the Generate-
          DataSet  operation.  This  identifier  can  be  used  to correlate a
          request with notifications from the SNS topic.
