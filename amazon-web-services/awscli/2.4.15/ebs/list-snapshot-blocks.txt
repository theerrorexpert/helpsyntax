NAME
       list-snapshot-blocks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about the blocks in an Amazon Elastic Block Store
       snapshot.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-snapshot-blocks
          --snapshot-id <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--starting-block-index <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --snapshot-id (string)
          The ID of the snapshot from which to get  block  indexes  and  block
          tokens.

       --next-token (string)
          The token to request the next page of results.

          If you specify NextToken , then StartingBlockIndex is ignored.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of blocks to be returned by the request.

          Even  if  additional  blocks can be retrieved from the snapshot, the
          request can return less blocks than MaxResults or an empty array  of
          blocks.

          To  retrieve  the next set of blocks from the snapshot, make another
          request with the returned NextToken value. The value of NextToken is
          null when there are no more blocks to return.

       --starting-block-index (integer)
          The  block  index  from which the list should start. The list in the
          response will start from this block index or the  next  valid  block
          index in the snapshot.

          If you specify NextToken , then StartingBlockIndex is ignored.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Blocks -> (list)
          An array of objects containing information about the blocks.

          (structure)
              A block of data in an Amazon Elastic Block Store snapshot.

              BlockIndex -> (integer)
                 The block index.

              BlockToken -> (string)
                 The block token for the block index.

       ExpiryTime -> (timestamp)
          The time when the BlockToken expires.

       VolumeSize -> (long)
          The size of the volume in GB.

       BlockSize -> (integer)
          The size of the blocks in the snapshot, in bytes.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is
          null when there are no more results to return.
