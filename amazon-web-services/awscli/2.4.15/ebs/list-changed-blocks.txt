LIST-CHANGED-BLOCKS()                                    LIST-CHANGED-BLOCKS()



NAME
       list-changed-blocks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  the  blocks that are different between two
       Amazon Elastic Block Store snapshots of the same  volume/snapshot  lin-
       eage.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-changed-blocks
          [--first-snapshot-id <value>]
          --second-snapshot-id <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--starting-block-index <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --first-snapshot-id (string)
          The ID of the first snapshot to use for the comparison.

          WARNING:
              The  FirstSnapshotID  parameter must be specified with a Second-
              SnapshotId parameter; otherwise, an error occurs.

       --second-snapshot-id (string)
          The ID of the second snapshot to use for the comparison.

          WARNING:
              The SecondSnapshotId parameter must be specified with  a  First-
              SnapshotID parameter; otherwise, an error occurs.

       --next-token (string)
          The token to request the next page of results.

          If you specify NextToken , then StartingBlockIndex is ignored.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of blocks to be returned by the request.

          Even  if  additional  blocks can be retrieved from the snapshot, the
          request can return less blocks than MaxResults or an empty array  of
          blocks.

          To  retrieve  the next set of blocks from the snapshot, make another
          request with the returned NextToken value. The value of NextToken is
          null when there are no more blocks to return.

       --starting-block-index (integer)
          The block index from which the comparison should start.

          The  list  in  the  response will start from this block index or the
          next valid block index in the snapshots.

          If you specify NextToken , then StartingBlockIndex is ignored.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ChangedBlocks -> (list)
          An array of objects containing information about the changed blocks.

          (structure)
              A  block  of data in an Amazon Elastic Block Store snapshot that
              is different from another snapshot of the  same  volume/snapshot
              lineage.

              BlockIndex -> (integer)
                 The block index.

              FirstBlockToken -> (string)
                 The  block  token  for the block index of the FirstSnapshotId
                 specified in the ListChangedBlocks operation. This  value  is
                 absent  if the first snapshot does not have the changed block
                 that is on the second snapshot.

              SecondBlockToken -> (string)
                 The block token for the block index of  the  SecondSnapshotId
                 specified in the ListChangedBlocks operation.

       ExpiryTime -> (timestamp)
          The time when the BlockToken expires.

       VolumeSize -> (long)
          The size of the volume in GB.

       BlockSize -> (integer)
          The size of the blocks in the snapshot, in bytes.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is
          null when there are no more results to return.
