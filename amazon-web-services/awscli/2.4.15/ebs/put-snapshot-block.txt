PUT-SNAPSHOT-BLOCK()                                      PUT-SNAPSHOT-BLOCK()



NAME
       put-snapshot-block -

DESCRIPTION
       Writes  a  block of data to a snapshot. If the specified block contains
       data, the existing data is overwritten. The target snapshot must be  in
       the pending state.

       Data written to a snapshot must be aligned with 512-KiB sectors.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-snapshot-block
          --snapshot-id <value>
          --block-index <value>
          --block-data <value>
          --data-length <value>
          [--progress <value>]
          --checksum <value>
          --checksum-algorithm <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --snapshot-id (string)
          The ID of the snapshot.

       --block-index (integer)
          The  block  index  of  the block in which to write the data. A block
          index is a logical index in units of 512 KiB blocks. To identify the
          block  index,  divide  the logical offset of the data in the logical
          volume by the block size (logical offset of data/524288 ). The logi-
          cal offset of the data must be 512 KiB aligned.

       --block-data (blob)
          The data to write to the block.

          The  block  data  is  not  signed as part of the Signature Version 4
          signing process. As a  result,  you  must  generate  and  provide  a
          Base64-encoded   SHA256  checksum  for  the  block  data  using  the
          x-amz-Checksum header. Also, you must specify the checksum algorithm
          using  the  x-amz-Checksum-Algorithm  header.  The checksum that you
          provide is part of the Signature Version 4 signing  process.  It  is
          validated  against  a checksum generated by Amazon EBS to ensure the
          validity and authenticity of the data. If the checksums do not  cor-
          respond,  the  request fails. For more information, see Using check-
          sums with the EBS direct APIs in the Amazon  Elastic  Compute  Cloud
          User Guide .

       --data-length (integer)
          The size of the data to write to the block, in bytes. Currently, the
          only supported size is 524288 bytes.

          Valid values: 524288

       --progress (integer)
          The progress of the write process, as a percentage.

       --checksum (string)
          A Base64-encoded SHA256 checksum of the data. Only SHA256  checksums
          are supported.

       --checksum-algorithm (string)
          The  algorithm  used  to  generate the checksum. Currently, the only
          supported algorithm is SHA256 .

          Possible values:

          o SHA256

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Checksum -> (string)
          The SHA256 checksum generated for the block data by Amazon EBS.

       ChecksumAlgorithm -> (string)
          The algorithm used by Amazon EBS to generate the checksum.
