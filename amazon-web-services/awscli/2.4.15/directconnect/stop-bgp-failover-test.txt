STOP-BGP-FAILOVER-TEST()                              STOP-BGP-FAILOVER-TEST()



NAME
       stop-bgp-failover-test -

DESCRIPTION
       Stops the virtual interface failover test.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            stop-bgp-failover-test
          --virtual-interface-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --virtual-interface-id (string)
          The ID of the virtual interface you no longer want to test.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       virtualInterfaceTest -> (structure)
          Information about the virtual interface failover test.

          testId -> (string)
              The ID of the virtual interface failover test.

          virtualInterfaceId -> (string)
              The ID of the tested virtual interface.

          bgpPeers -> (list)
              The  BGP  peers  that  were put in the DOWN state as part of the
              virtual interface failover test.

              (string)

          status -> (string)
              The status of the virtual interface failover test.

          ownerAccount -> (string)
              The owner ID of the tested virtual interface.

          testDurationInMinutes -> (integer)
              The time that the virtual interface failover test  ran  in  min-
              utes.

          startTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the virtual interface moves to the DOWN state.

          endTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the virtual interface moves out of the DOWN state.
