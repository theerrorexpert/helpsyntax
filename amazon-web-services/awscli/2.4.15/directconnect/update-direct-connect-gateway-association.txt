SYNOPSIS
            update-direct-connect-gateway-association
          [--association-id <value>]
          [--add-allowed-prefixes-to-direct-connect-gateway <value>]
          [--remove-allowed-prefixes-to-direct-connect-gateway <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --association-id (string)
          The ID of the Direct Connect gateway association.

       --add-allowed-prefixes-to-direct-connect-gateway (list)
          The Amazon VPC prefixes to advertise to the Direct Connect  gateway.

          (structure)
              Information  about  a  route  filter  prefix that a customer can
              advertise through Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)  over  a  public
              virtual interface.

              cidr -> (string)
                 The  CIDR  block  for the advertised route. Separate multiple
                 routes using commas. An IPv6 CIDR must use /64 or shorter.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          cidr=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "cidr": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --remove-allowed-prefixes-to-direct-connect-gateway (list)
          The Amazon VPC prefixes to no longer advertise to the Direct Connect
          gateway.

          (structure)
              Information  about  a  route  filter  prefix that a customer can
              advertise through Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)  over  a  public
              virtual interface.

              cidr -> (string)
                 The  CIDR  block  for the advertised route. Separate multiple
                 routes using commas. An IPv6 CIDR must use /64 or shorter.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          cidr=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "cidr": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update the specified attributes of the Direct Connect gateway  asso-
       ciation

       The  following  update-direct-connect-gateway-association  example adds
       the specified CIDR block to a Direct Connect gateway association.

          aws directconnect update-direct-connect-gateway-association \
              --association-id 820a6e4f-5374-4004-8317-3f64bEXAMPLE \
              --add-allowed-prefixes-to-direct-connect-gateway cidr=192.168.2.0/30

       Output:

          {
              "directConnectGatewayAssociation": {
                  "directConnectGatewayId": "11460968-4ac1-4fd3-bdb2-00599EXAMPLE",
                  "directConnectGatewayOwnerAccount": "111122223333",
