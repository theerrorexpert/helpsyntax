NAME
       describe-hosted-connections -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  hosted connections that have been provisioned on the speci-
       fied interconnect or link aggregation group (LAG).

       NOTE:
          Intended for use by Direct Connect Partners only.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-hosted-connections
          --connection-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --connection-id (string)
          The ID of the interconnect or LAG.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

                 nection.

              connectionId -> (string)
                 The ID of the connection.

                   sioned on an interconnect.  The  connection  stays  in  the
                   ordering  state  until  the  owner of the hosted connection
                   confirms or declines the connection order.

                 o requested : The initial state of a standard connection. The
                   connection stays in the requested state until the Letter of
                   Authorization (LOA) is sent to the customer.

                 o pending : The connection has been  approved  and  is  being
                   initialized.

                 o available  :  The  network link is up and the connection is
                   ready for use.

                 o down : The network link is down.

                 o deleting : The connection is being deleted.

                 o deleted : The connection has been deleted.

                 o rejected : A hosted connection in the ordering state enters
                   the rejected state if it is deleted by the customer.

                 o unknown : The state of the connection is not available.
