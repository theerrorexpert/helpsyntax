CREATE-CONNECTION()                                        CREATE-CONNECTION()



NAME
       create-connection -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  connection between a customer network and a specific Direct
       Connect location.

       A connection links your internal network to an Direct Connect  location
       over  a  standard  Ethernet  fiber-optic cable. One end of the cable is
       connected to your router, the other to an Direct Connect router.

       To find the locations for your Region, use  DescribeLocations .

       You can automatically add the new  connection  to  a  link  aggregation
       group  (LAG)  by  specifying a LAG ID in the request. This ensures that
       the new connection is allocated on the  same  Direct  Connect  endpoint
       that  hosts  the  specified LAG. If there are no available ports on the
       endpoint, the request fails and no connection is created.

OPTIONS
       --location (string)
          The location of the connection.

       --bandwidth (string)
          The bandwidth of the connection.

       --connection-name (string)
          The name of the connection.

       --lag-id (string)
          The ID of the LAG.

       --tags (list)
          The tags to associate with the lag.

          (structure)
              Information about a tag.

              key -> (string)
                 The key.

              value -> (string)
                 The value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --provider-name (string)
          The name of the service provider associated with the requested  con-
          nection.

       --request-mac-sec | --no-request-mac-sec (boolean)
          Indicates  whether  you  want the connection to support MAC Security
          (MACsec).

          MAC Security (MACsec) is only available  on  dedicated  connections.
          For  information  about  MAC  Security  (MACsec)  prerequisties, see
          MACsec prerequisties in the Direct Connect User Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
