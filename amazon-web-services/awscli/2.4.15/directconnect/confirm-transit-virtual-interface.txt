CONFIRM-TRANSIT-VIRTUAL-INTERFACE()        CONFIRM-TRANSIT-VIRTUAL-INTERFACE()



NAME
       confirm-transit-virtual-interface -

DESCRIPTION
       Accepts  ownership  of  a  transit virtual interface created by another
       Amazon Web Services account.

       After the owner of the transit virtual interface makes this  call,  the
       specified  transit  virtual  interface is created and made available to
       handle traffic.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            confirm-transit-virtual-interface
          --virtual-interface-id <value>
          --direct-connect-gateway-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --virtual-interface-id (string)
          The ID of the virtual interface.

       --direct-connect-gateway-id (string)
          The ID of the Direct Connect gateway.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To accept ownership of a transit virtual interface

       The following confirm-transit-virtual-interface accepts ownership of  a
       transit virtual interface created by another customer.

          aws directconnect confirm-transit-virtual-interface \
              --virtual-interface-id dxvif-fEXAMPLE \
              --direct-connect-gateway-id 4112ccf9-25e9-4111-8237-b6c5dEXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "virtualInterfaceState": "pending"
          }

       AWS Direct Connect User Guide.

OUTPUT
       virtualInterfaceState -> (string)
          The state of the virtual interface. The following are  the  possible
          values:

          o confirming : The creation of the virtual interface is pending con-
            firmation from the virtual interface owner. If the  owner  of  the
            virtual interface is different from the owner of the connection on
            which it is provisioned, then the virtual interface will remain in
            this state until it is confirmed by the virtual interface owner.

          o verifying  : This state only applies to public virtual interfaces.
            Each public virtual interface needs validation before the  virtual
            interface can be created.

          o pending  : A virtual interface is in this state from the time that
            it is created until the virtual  interface  is  ready  to  forward
            traffic.

          o available : A virtual interface that is able to forward traffic.

          o down : A virtual interface that is BGP down.

          o deleting  : A virtual interface is in this state immediately after
            calling  DeleteVirtualInterface until it  can  no  longer  forward
            traffic.

          o deleted : A virtual interface that cannot forward traffic.

          o rejected  :  The  virtual interface owner has declined creation of
            the virtual interface. If a virtual interface  in  the  Confirming
            state  is  deleted  by  the  virtual  interface owner, the virtual
            interface enters the Rejected state.

          o unknown : The state of the virtual interface is not available.
