DISASSOCIATE-CONNECTION-FROM-LAG()          DISASSOCIATE-CONNECTION-FROM-LAG()



NAME
       disassociate-connection-from-lag -

DESCRIPTION
       Disassociates  a  connection  from  a link aggregation group (LAG). The
       connection is interrupted and re-established as a standalone connection
       (the  connection  is  not  deleted;  to  delete the connection, use the
       DeleteConnection request). If the LAG has associated virtual interfaces
       or  hosted connections, they remain associated with the LAG. A disasso-
       ciated connection owned by an Direct Connect Partner  is  automatically
       converted to an interconnect.

       If  disassociating the connection would cause the LAG to fall below its
       setting for minimum number  of  operational  connections,  the  request
       fails,  except when it's the last member of the LAG. If all connections
       are disassociated, the LAG continues to exist as an empty LAG  with  no
       physical connections.

SYNOPSIS
            disassociate-connection-from-lag
          --connection-id <value>
          --lag-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --connection-id (string)
          The ID of the connection.

       --lag-id (string)
          The ID of the LAG.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          o deleting : The connection is being deleted.

          o deleted : The connection has been deleted.

          o rejected : A hosted connection in the ordering  state  enters  the
