UPDATE-LAG()                                                      UPDATE-LAG()



NAME
       update-lag -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the attributes of the specified link aggregation group (LAG).

       You can update the following LAG attributes:

       o The name of the LAG.

       o The  value  for the minimum number of connections that must be opera-
         tional for the LAG itself to be operational.

       o The LAG's MACsec encryption mode. Amazon Web  Services  assigns  this
         value to each connection which is part of the LAG.

       o The tags

       NOTE:
          If  you  adjust the threshold value for the minimum number of opera-
          tional connections, ensure that the new value does not cause the LAG
          to fall below the threshold and become non-operational.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-lag
          --lag-id <value>
          [--lag-name <value>]
          [--minimum-links <value>]
          [--encryption-mode <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --lag-id (string)
          The ID of the LAG.

       --lag-name (string)
          The name of the LAG.

       --minimum-links (integer)
          The  minimum number of physical connections that must be operational
          for the LAG itself to be operational.

       --encryption-mode (string)
          The LAG MAC Security (MACsec) encryption mode.

          Amazon Web Services applies the value to all connections  which  are
          part of the LAG.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
