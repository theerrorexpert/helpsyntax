CREATE-INTERCONNECT()                                    CREATE-INTERCONNECT()



NAME
       create-interconnect -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an interconnect between an Direct Connect Partner's network and
       a specific Direct Connect location.

       An interconnect is a connection that is capable of hosting  other  con-
       nections. The Direct Connect Partner can use an interconnect to provide
       Direct Connect hosted connections to customers through their  own  net-
       work  services.  Like  a standard connection, an interconnect links the
       partner's network to an Direct Connect location over a standard  Ether-
       net  fiber-optic  cable.  One end is connected to the partner's router,
       the other to an Direct Connect router.

       You can automatically add the new interconnect to  a  link  aggregation
       group  (LAG)  by  specifying a LAG ID in the request. This ensures that
       the new interconnect is allocated on the same Direct  Connect  endpoint
       that  hosts  the  specified LAG. If there are no available ports on the
       endpoint, the request fails and no interconnect is created.

       For each end customer, the Direct Connect Partner provisions a  connec-
       tion  on  their interconnect by calling  AllocateHostedConnection . The
       end customer can then connect to Amazon Web Services resources by  cre-
       ating  a virtual interface on their connection, using the VLAN assigned
       to them by the Direct Connect Partner.

       NOTE:
          Intended for use by Direct Connect Partners only.

SYNOPSIS
            create-interconnect
          --interconnect-name <value>
          --bandwidth <value>
          --location <value>
          [--lag-id <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--provider-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --interconnect-name (string)
          The name of the interconnect.

       --bandwidth (string)
          The port bandwidth, in Gbps. The possible values are 1 and 10.

       --location (string)
          The location of the interconnect.

       --lag-id (string)
          The ID of the LAG.

       --tags (list)
          The tags to associate with the interconnect.

          (structure)
              Information about a tag.

              key -> (string)
                 The key.

              value -> (string)
                 The value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --provider-name (string)
          The name of the service provider associated with the interconnect.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To create an interconnect between a partner's network and AWS

       The  following  create-interconnect  command  creates  an  interconnect
       between  an  AWS  Direct  Connect  partner's network and a specific AWS
       Direct Connect location:

          aws directconnect create-interconnect --interconnect-name "1G Interconnect to AWS" --bandwidth 1Gbps --location TIVIT

       Output:
