DESCRIBE-INTERCONNECTS()                              DESCRIBE-INTERCONNECTS()



NAME
       describe-interconnects -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  interconnects  owned  by the Amazon Web Services account or
       only the specified interconnect.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-interconnects
          [--interconnect-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --interconnect-id (string)
          The ID of the interconnect.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list interconnects

       The following describe-interconnects command  lists  the  interconnects
       owned by your AWS account:

          aws directconnect describe-interconnects

       Output:

          {
              "interconnects": [
                  {
                      "region": "sa-east-1",
                      "bandwidth": "1Gbps",
                      "location": "TIVIT",
                      "interconnectName": "1G Interconnect to AWS",
                      "interconnectId": "dxcon-fgktov66",
                      "interconnectState": "down"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       interconnects -> (list)
          The interconnects.

          (structure)
              Information about an interconnect.

              interconnectId -> (string)
                 The ID of the interconnect.

              interconnectName -> (string)

              interconnectState -> (string)
                 The state of the interconnect. The following are the possible
                 values:

                 o requested : The  initial  state  of  an  interconnect.  The
                   interconnect  stays in the requested state until the Letter
                   of Authorization (LOA) is sent to the customer.

                 o pending : The interconnect is approved, and is  being  ini-
                   tialized.

                 o available : The network link is up, and the interconnect is
                   ready for use.

                 o down : The network link is down.

                 o deleting : The interconnect is being deleted.

                 o deleted : The interconnect is deleted.

                 o unknown : The state of the interconnect is not available.

              region -> (string)
                 The Amazon  Web  Services  Region  where  the  connection  is
                 located.

                 connection.

              lagId -> (string)
                 The ID of the LAG.

              awsDevice -> (string)
                 The Direct Connect endpoint on which the physical  connection
                 terminates.

              jumboFrameCapable -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether jumbo frames (9001 MTU) are supported.

              awsDeviceV2 -> (string)
                 The Direct Connect endpoint that terminates the physical con-
                 nection.

              awsLogicalDeviceId -> (string)
                 The Direct Connect endpoint that terminates the logical  con-
                 nection.  This device might be different than the device that
                 terminates the physical connection.

              hasLogicalRedundancy -> (string)
                 Indicates whether the interconnect supports a  secondary  BGP
                 in the same address family (IPv4/IPv6).
