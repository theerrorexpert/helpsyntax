DELETE-DIRECT-CONNECT-GATEWAY-ASSOCDELETE-DIRECT-CONNECT-GATEWAY-ASSOCIATION()



NAME
       delete-direct-connect-gateway-association -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the  association  between the specified Direct Connect gateway
       and virtual private gateway.

       We recommend that you specify the associationID to delete the  associa-
       tion.  Alternatively,  if  you own virtual gateway and a Direct Connect
       gateway association, you can specify the virtualGatewayId  and  direct-
       ConnectGatewayId to delete an association.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-direct-connect-gateway-association
          [--association-id <value>]
          [--direct-connect-gateway-id <value>]
          [--virtual-gateway-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --association-id (string)
          The ID of the Direct Connect gateway association.

       --direct-connect-gateway-id (string)
          The ID of the Direct Connect gateway.

       --virtual-gateway-id (string)
          The ID of the virtual private gateway.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a Direct Connect gateway association

       The following delete-direct-connect-gateway-association example deletes
       the Direct Connect gateway association with a transit gateway that  has
       the specified association ID.

          aws directconnect delete-direct-connect-gateway-association --association-id  be85116d-46eb-4b43-a27a-da0c2ad648de

       Output:

          {
              "directConnectGatewayAssociation": {
                  "directConnectGatewayId": "11460968-4ac1-4fd3-bdb2-00599EXAMPlE",
                  "directConnectGatewayOwnerAccount": "123456789012",
                  "associationState": "disassociating",
                  "associatedGateway": {
                      "id": "tgw-095b3b0b54EXAMPLE",
                      "type": "transitGateway",
                      "ownerAccount": "123456789012",
                      "region": "us-east-1"
                 },
                  "associationId": " be85116d-46eb-4b43-a27a-da0c2ad648deEXAMPLE ",
                  "allowedPrefixesToDirectConnectGateway": [
                      {
                          "cidr": "192.0.1.0/28"
                      }
                  ]
              }
          }

              values:
