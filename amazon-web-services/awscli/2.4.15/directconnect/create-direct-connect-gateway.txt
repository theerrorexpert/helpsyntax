CREATE-DIRECT-CONNECT-GATEWAY()                CREATE-DIRECT-CONNECT-GATEWAY()



NAME
       create-direct-connect-gateway -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a Direct Connect gateway, which is an intermediate object that
       enables you to connect a set of virtual interfaces and virtual  private
       gateways.  A Direct Connect gateway is global and visible in any Amazon
       Web Services Region after it is created.  The  virtual  interfaces  and
       virtual  private  gateways  that are connected through a Direct Connect
       gateway can be in different Amazon Web Services Regions.  This  enables
       you  to  connect  to  a  VPC in any Region, regardless of the Region in
       which the virtual interfaces are  located,  and  pass  traffic  between
       them.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-direct-connect-gateway
          --direct-connect-gateway-name <value>
          [--amazon-side-asn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --direct-connect-gateway-name (string)
          The name of the Direct Connect gateway.

       --amazon-side-asn (long)
          The autonomous system number (ASN) for Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
          to be configured on the Amazon side of the connection. The ASN  must
          be  in  the  private  range  of 64,512 to 65,534 or 4,200,000,000 to
          4,294,967,294. The default is 64512.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a Direct Connect gateway

       The following example creates a Direct Connect gateway  with  the  name
       DxGateway1.

       Command:

          aws directconnect create-direct-connect-gateway --direct-connect-gateway-name "DxGateway1"

       Output:

          {
            "directConnectGateway": {
                "amazonSideAsn": 64512,
                "directConnectGatewayId": "5f294f92-bafb-4011-916d-9b0bdexample",
                "ownerAccount": "123456789012",
                "directConnectGatewayName": "DxGateway1",
                "directConnectGatewayState": "available"
            }
          }

OUTPUT
       directConnectGateway -> (structure)
          The Direct Connect gateway.

          directConnectGatewayId -> (string)
              The ID of the Direct Connect gateway.

          directConnectGatewayName -> (string)
              The name of the Direct Connect gateway.

          amazonSideAsn -> (long)
              The  autonomous  system  number (ASN) for the Amazon side of the
              connection.

          ownerAccount -> (string)
              The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns  the  Direct
              Connect gateway.

          directConnectGatewayState -> (string)
              The  state  of the Direct Connect gateway. The following are the
              possible values:

              o pending : The initial state  after  calling   CreateDirectCon-
                nectGateway .

              o available : The Direct Connect gateway is ready for use.

              o deleting  :  The initial state after calling  DeleteDirectCon-
                nectGateway .

              o deleted : The Direct Connect gateway  is  deleted  and  cannot
                pass traffic.

          stateChangeError -> (string)
              The error message if the state of an object failed to advance.
