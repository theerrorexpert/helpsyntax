ASSOCIATE-VIRTUAL-INTERFACE()                    ASSOCIATE-VIRTUAL-INTERFACE()



NAME
       associate-virtual-interface -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  a virtual interface with a specified link aggregation group
       (LAG) or connection. Connectivity to Amazon Web Services is temporarily
       interrupted  as  the virtual interface is being migrated. If the target
       connection or LAG has an associated virtual interface with a  conflict-
       ing VLAN number or a conflicting IP address, the operation fails.

       Virtual  interfaces associated with a hosted connection cannot be asso-
       ciated with a LAG; hosted connections must be migrated along with their
       virtual interfaces using  AssociateHostedConnection .

       To  reassociate  a  virtual  interface  to a new connection or LAG, the
       requester must own either the virtual interface itself or  the  connec-
       tion  to which the virtual interface is currently associated. Addition-
       ally, the requester must own the connection or LAG for the association.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            associate-virtual-interface
          --virtual-interface-id <value>
          --connection-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --virtual-interface-id (string)
          The ID of the virtual interface.

       --connection-id (string)
          The ID of the LAG or connection.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To associate a virtual interface with a connection

       The  following  example associates the specified virtual interface with
       the specified LAG. Alternatively, to associate  the  virtual  interface
       with  a  connection, specify the ID of an AWS Direct Connect connection
       for --connection-id; for example, dxcon-ffnikghc.

       Command:

          aws directconnect associate-virtual-interface --connection-id dxlag-ffjhj9lx --virtual-interface-id dxvif-fgputw0j

          The state of the virtual interface. The following are  the  possible
          values:

          o confirming : The creation of the virtual interface is pending con-
            firmation from the virtual interface owner. If the  owner  of  the
            virtual interface is different from the owner of the connection on
            which it is provisioned, then the virtual interface will remain in
            this state until it is confirmed by the virtual interface owner.

          o verifying  : This state only applies to public virtual interfaces.
            Each public virtual interface needs validation before the  virtual
            interface can be created.

          o pending  : A virtual interface is in this state from the time that
            it is created until the virtual  interface  is  ready  to  forward
            traffic.

          o available : A virtual interface that is able to forward traffic.

          o down : A virtual interface that is BGP down.

          o deleting  : A virtual interface is in this state immediately after
            calling  DeleteVirtualInterface until it  can  no  longer  forward
            traffic.

          o deleted : A virtual interface that cannot forward traffic.

          o rejected  :  The  virtual interface owner has declined creation of
            the virtual interface. If a virtual interface  in  the  Confirming
            state  is  deleted  by  the  virtual  interface owner, the virtual
            interface enters the Rejected state.

          o unknown : The state of the virtual interface is not available.

          The customer router configuration.

       mtu -> (integer)

              virtual interface.

              cidr -> (string)
                 The  CIDR  block  for the advertised route. Separate multiple
                 routes using commas. An IPv6 CIDR must use /64 or shorter.
