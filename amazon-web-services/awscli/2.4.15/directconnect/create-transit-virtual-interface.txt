NAME
       create-transit-virtual-interface -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a transit virtual interface. A transit virtual interface should
       be used to access one or more transit gateways associated  with  Direct
       Connect gateways. A transit virtual interface enables the connection of
       multiple VPCs attached to a transit gateway to a Direct  Connect  gate-
       way.

       WARNING:
          If  you  associate your transit gateway with one or more Direct Con-
          nect gateways, the Autonomous System Number (ASN) used by the  tran-
          sit  gateway  and  the Direct Connect gateway must be different. For
          example, if you use the default ASN 64512 for both your the  transit
          gateway and Direct Connect gateway, the association request fails.

       Setting the MTU of a virtual interface to 8500 (jumbo frames) can cause
       an update to the underlying physical connection if it wasn't updated to
       support  jumbo frames. Updating the connection disrupts network connec-
       tivity for all virtual interfaces associated with the connection for up
       to  30 seconds. To check whether your connection supports jumbo frames,
       call  DescribeConnections . To check  whether  your  virtual  interface
       supports jumbo frames, call  DescribeVirtualInterfaces .

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "virtualInterfaceName": "string",
            "vlan": integer,
            "asn": integer,
            "mtu": integer,
            "authKey": "string",
            "amazonAddress": "string",
            "customerAddress": "string",
            "addressFamily": "ipv4"|"ipv6",
            "directConnectGatewayId": "string",
            "tags": [
              {
                "key": "string",
                "value": "string"
              }
              ...
            ],
            "enableSiteLink": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

              ble values:

              o confirming : The creation of the virtual interface is  pending
                confirmation from the virtual interface owner. If the owner of
                the virtual interface is different from the owner of the  con-
                nection on which it is provisioned, then the virtual interface
                will remain in this state until it is confirmed by the virtual
                interface owner.

              o verifying  :  This state only applies to public virtual inter-
                faces. Each public virtual interface needs  validation  before
                the virtual interface can be created.

              o pending  :  A virtual interface is in this state from the time
                that it is created until the virtual  interface  is  ready  to
                forward traffic.

              o available  : A virtual interface that is able to forward traf-
                fic.

              o down : A virtual interface that is BGP down.

              o deleting : A virtual interface is in  this  state  immediately
                after  calling   DeleteVirtualInterface until it can no longer
                forward traffic.

              o deleted : A virtual interface that cannot forward traffic.

              o rejected : The virtual interface owner has  declined  creation
                of  the  virtual interface. If a virtual interface in the Con-
                firming state is deleted by the virtual interface  owner,  the
                virtual interface enters the Rejected state.

              o unknown : The state of the virtual interface is not available.

          customerRouterConfig -> (string)
              The customer router configuration.

          routeFilterPrefixes -> (list)
              The routes to be advertised to the Amazon Web  Services  network
              in this Region. Applies to public virtual interfaces.

              (structure)
                 Information  about  a route filter prefix that a customer can
                 advertise through Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) over a public
                 virtual interface.

                 cidr -> (string)
                     The  CIDR block for the advertised route. Separate multi-
                     ple routes using commas. An IPv6 CIDR  must  use  /64  or
                     shorter.

                     has  a  minimum  length of 6 characters and and a maximun
                     lenth of 80 characters.

                       validation before the BGP peer  can  be  created.  This
                       state applies only to public virtual interfaces.

                     o pending  : The BGP peer is created, and remains in this
                       state until it is ready to be established.

                     o available : The BGP peer is ready to be established.

                     o deleting : The BGP peer is being deleted.

                     o deleted : The BGP peer is deleted and cannot be  estab-
                       lished.

                 bgpStatus -> (string)
                     The  status of the BGP peer. The following are the possi-
                     ble values:

                     o up : The BGP peer is established. This state  does  not
                       indicate the state of the routing function. Ensure that
                       you are receiving routes over the BGP session.
