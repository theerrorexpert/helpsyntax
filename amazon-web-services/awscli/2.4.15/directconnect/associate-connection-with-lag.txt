ASSOCIATE-CONNECTION-WITH-LAG()                ASSOCIATE-CONNECTION-WITH-LAG()



NAME
       associate-connection-with-lag -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  an existing connection with a link aggregation group (LAG).
       The connection is interrupted and re-established as a member of the LAG
       (connectivity  to  Amazon  Web Services is interrupted). The connection
       must be hosted on the same Direct Connect endpoint as the LAG, and  its
       bandwidth  must match the bandwidth for the LAG. You can re-associate a
       connection that's currently associated with a different  LAG;  however,
       if  removing  the connection would cause the original LAG to fall below
       its setting for minimum number of operational connections, the  request
       fails.

       Any virtual interfaces that are directly associated with the connection
       are automatically re-associated with the LAG.  If  the  connection  was
       originally  associated  with  a  different  LAG, the virtual interfaces
       remain associated with the original LAG.

       For interconnects, any hosted connections are automatically  re-associ-
       ated with the LAG. If the interconnect was originally associated with a
       different LAG, the hosted connections remain associated with the origi-
       nal LAG.

SYNOPSIS
            associate-connection-with-lag
          --connection-id <value>
          --lag-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --connection-id (string)
          The ID of the connection.

       --lag-id (string)
          The ID of the LAG with which to associate the connection.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
