START-BGP-FAILOVER-TEST()                            START-BGP-FAILOVER-TEST()



NAME
       start-bgp-failover-test -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  the virtual interface failover test that verifies your configu-
       ration meets your resiliency requirements by placing  the  BGP  peering
       session  in  the  DOWN  state. You can then send traffic to verify that
       there are no outages.

       You can run the test on public, private, transit,  and  hosted  virtual
       interfaces.

       You  can use ListVirtualInterfaceTestHistory to view the virtual inter-
       face test history.

       If you need to stop the test before the test  interval  completes,  use
       StopBgpFailoverTest .

SYNOPSIS
            start-bgp-failover-test
          --virtual-interface-id <value>
          [--bgp-peers <value>]
          [--test-duration-in-minutes <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --virtual-interface-id (string)
          The ID of the virtual interface you want to test.

       --bgp-peers (list)
          The BGP peers to place in the DOWN state.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --test-duration-in-minutes (integer)
          The  time  in  minutes that the virtual interface failover test will
          last.

          Maximum value: 180 minutes (3 hours).

          Default: 180 minutes (3 hours).

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       virtualInterfaceTest -> (structure)
          Information about the virtual interface failover test.

          testId -> (string)
              The ID of the virtual interface failover test.

          virtualInterfaceId -> (string)
              The ID of the tested virtual interface.

          bgpPeers -> (list)
              The BGP peers that were put in the DOWN state  as  part  of  the
              virtual interface failover test.

              (string)

          status -> (string)
              The status of the virtual interface failover test.

          ownerAccount -> (string)
              The owner ID of the tested virtual interface.

          testDurationInMinutes -> (integer)
              The  time  that  the virtual interface failover test ran in min-
              utes.

          startTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the virtual interface moves to the DOWN state.

          endTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the virtual interface moves out of the DOWN state.
