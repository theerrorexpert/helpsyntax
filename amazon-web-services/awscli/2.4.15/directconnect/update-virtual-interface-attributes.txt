NAME
       update-virtual-interface-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the  specified  attributes  of  the  specified virtual private
       interface.

       Setting the MTU of a virtual interface to 9001 (jumbo frames) can cause
       an update to the underlying physical connection if it wasn't updated to
       support jumbo frames. Updating the connection disrupts network  connec-
       tivity for all virtual interfaces associated with the connection for up
       to 30 seconds. To check whether your connection supports jumbo  frames,
       call   DescribeConnections  . To check whether your virtual q interface
       supports jumbo frames, call  DescribeVirtualInterfaces .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-virtual-interface-attributes
          --virtual-interface-id <value>
          [--mtu <value>]
          [--enable-site-link | --no-enable-site-link]
          [--virtual-interface-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --virtual-interface-id (string)
          The ID of the virtual private interface.

       --mtu (integer)
          The maximum transmission unit (MTU), in bytes. The supported  values
          are 1500 and 9001. The default value is 1500.

       --enable-site-link | --no-enable-site-link (boolean)
          Indicates whether to enable or disable SiteLink.

       --virtual-interface-name (string)
          The name of the virtual private interface.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          The state of the virtual interface. The following are  the  possible
          values:

          o confirming : The creation of the virtual interface is pending con-
            firmation from the virtual interface owner. If the  owner  of  the
            virtual interface is different from the owner of the connection on
            which it is provisioned, then the virtual interface will remain in
            this state until it is confirmed by the virtual interface owner.

          o verifying  : This state only applies to public virtual interfaces.
            Each public virtual interface needs validation before the  virtual
            interface can be created.

          o pending  : A virtual interface is in this state from the time that
            it is created until the virtual  interface  is  ready  to  forward
            traffic.

          o available : A virtual interface that is able to forward traffic.

          o down : A virtual interface that is BGP down.

          o deleting  : A virtual interface is in this state immediately after
            calling  DeleteVirtualInterface until it  can  no  longer  forward
            traffic.

          o deleted : A virtual interface that cannot forward traffic.

          o rejected  :  The  virtual interface owner has declined creation of
            the virtual interface. If a virtual interface  in  the  Confirming
            state  is  deleted  by  the  virtual  interface owner, the virtual
            interface enters the Rejected state.

          The customer router configuration.

       mtu -> (integer)

              cidr -> (string)
                 The  CIDR  block  for the advertised route. Separate multiple
                 routes using commas. An IPv6 CIDR must use /64 or shorter.
