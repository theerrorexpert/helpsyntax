SYNOPSIS
            accept-direct-connect-gateway-association-proposal
          --direct-connect-gateway-id <value>
          --proposal-id <value>
          --associated-gateway-owner-account <value>
          [--override-allowed-prefixes-to-direct-connect-gateway <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --direct-connect-gateway-id (string)
          The ID of the Direct Connect gateway.

       --proposal-id (string)
          The ID of the request proposal.

       --associated-gateway-owner-account (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the virtual pri-
          vate gateway or transit gateway.

       --override-allowed-prefixes-to-direct-connect-gateway (list)
          Overrides  the  Amazon VPC prefixes advertised to the Direct Connect
          gateway.

          For information about how to set the prefixes, see Allowed  Prefixes
          in the Direct Connect User Guide .

          (structure)
              Information  about  a  route  filter  prefix that a customer can
              advertise through Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)  over  a  public
              virtual interface.

              cidr -> (string)
                 The  CIDR  block  for the advertised route. Separate multiple
                 routes using commas. An IPv6 CIDR must use /64 or shorter.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          cidr=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "cidr": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
