DESCRIPTION
       Lists the virtual interface failover test history.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-virtual-interface-test-history
          [--test-id <value>]
          [--virtual-interface-id <value>]
          [--bgp-peers <value>]
          [--status <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --test-id (string)
          The ID of the virtual interface failover test.

       --virtual-interface-id (string)
          The ID of the virtual interface that was tested.

       --bgp-peers (list)
          The  BGP peers that were placed in the DOWN state during the virtual
          interface failover test.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --status (string)
          The status of the virtual interface failover test.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to  return  with  a  single  call.  To
          retrieve  the remaining results, make another call with the returned
          nextToken value.

          If MaxResults is given a value larger than 100, only 100 results are
          returned.

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next page of results.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       virtualInterfaceTestHistory -> (list)
          The ID of the tested virtual interface.

          (structure)
              Information about the virtual interface failover test.

              testId -> (string)
                 The ID of the virtual interface failover test.

              virtualInterfaceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the tested virtual interface.

              bgpPeers -> (list)
                 The  BGP peers that were put in the DOWN state as part of the
                 virtual interface failover test.

                 (string)

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the virtual interface failover test.

              ownerAccount -> (string)
                 The owner ID of the tested virtual interface.

              testDurationInMinutes -> (integer)
                 The time that the virtual interface failover test ran in min-
                 utes.

              startTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time that the virtual interface moves to the DOWN state.

              endTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the virtual interface moves  out  of  the  DOWN
                 state.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is
          null when there are no more results to return.
