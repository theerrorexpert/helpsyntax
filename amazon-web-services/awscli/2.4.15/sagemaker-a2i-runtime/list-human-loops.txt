LIST-HUMAN-LOOPS()                                          LIST-HUMAN-LOOPS()



NAME
       list-human-loops -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about human loops, given the specified parameters.
       If a human loop was deleted, it will not be included.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-human-loops is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: HumanLoopSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-human-loops
          [--creation-time-after <value>]
          [--creation-time-before <value>]
          --flow-definition-arn <value>
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          (Optional)  The  timestamp of the date when you want the human loops
          to begin in ISO 8601 format. For example, 2020-02-24 .

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          (Optional) The timestamp of the date before which you want the human
          loops to begin in ISO 8601 format. For example, 2020-02-24 .

       --flow-definition-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a flow definition.

       --sort-order (string)
          Optional.  The order for displaying results. Valid values: Ascending
          and Descending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       HumanLoopSummaries -> (list)
          An  array of objects that contain information about the human loops.

          (structure)
              Summary information about the human loop.

              HumanLoopName -> (string)
                 The name of the human loop.

              HumanLoopStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the human loop.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 When Amazon Augmented AI created the human loop.

              FailureReason -> (string)
                 The reason why the human loop failed.  A  failure  reason  is
                 returned when the status of the human loop is Failed .

              FlowDefinitionArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the flow definition used to
                 configure the human loop.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token to display the next page of results.
