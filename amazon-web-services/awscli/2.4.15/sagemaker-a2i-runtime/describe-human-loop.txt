DESCRIBE-HUMAN-LOOP()                                    DESCRIBE-HUMAN-LOOP()



NAME
       describe-human-loop -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about the specified human loop. If the human loop
       was deleted, this operation  will  return  a  ResourceNotFoundException
       error.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-human-loop
          --human-loop-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --human-loop-name (string)
          The name of the human loop that you want information about.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The creation time when Amazon Augmented AI created the human loop.

       FailureReason -> (string)
          The  reason  why a human loop failed. The failure reason is returned
          when the status of the human loop is Failed .

       FailureCode -> (string)
          A failure code that identifies the type of failure.

          Possible values: ValidationError , Expired , InternalError

       HumanLoopStatus -> (string)
          The status of the human loop.

       HumanLoopName -> (string)
          The name of the human loop.  The  name  must  be  lowercase,  unique
          within the Region in your account, and can have up to 63 characters.
          Valid characters: a-z, 0-9, and - (hyphen).

       HumanLoopArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the human loop.

       FlowDefinitionArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the flow definition.

       HumanLoopOutput -> (structure)
          An object that contains information about the output  of  the  human
          loop.

          OutputS3Uri -> (string)
              The  location  of the Amazon S3 object where Amazon Augmented AI
              stores your human loop output.
