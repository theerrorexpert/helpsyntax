NAME
       storagegateway -

DESCRIPTION
       Storage  Gateway  is  the service that connects an on-premises software
       appliance with cloud-based storage to provide seamless and secure inte-
       gration  between  an  organization's on-premises IT environment and the
       Amazon Web Services storage infrastructure. The service enables you  to
       securely  upload  data to the Amazon Web Services Cloud for cost effec-
       tive backup and rapid disaster recovery.

       Use the following links to get started using the Storage  Gateway  Ser-
       vice API Reference :

       o Storage  Gateway  required  request  headers : Describes the required
         headers that you must send with every POST request to  Storage  Gate-
         way.

       o Signing  requests  :  Storage  Gateway requires that you authenticate
         every request you send; this topic describes how sign such a request.

       o Error  responses : Provides reference information about Storage Gate-
         way errors.

       o Operations in Storage Gateway : Contains detailed descriptions of all
         Storage  Gateway  operations, their request parameters, response ele-
         ments, possible errors, and examples of requests and responses.

       o Storage Gateway endpoints and quotas : Provides a list of each Amazon
         Web  Services Region and the endpoints available for use with Storage
         Gateway.

       NOTE:
          Storage Gateway resource IDs are in uppercase. When  you  use  these
          resource  IDs  with  the Amazon EC2 API, EC2 expects resource IDs in
          lowercase. You must change your resource ID to lowercase to  use  it
          with  the EC2 API. For example, in Storage Gateway the ID for a vol-
          ume might be vol-AA22BB012345DAF670 . When you use this ID with  the
          EC2  API,  you must change it to vol-aa22bb012345daf670 . Otherwise,
          the EC2 API might not behave as expected.

       WARNING:
          IDs for Storage Gateway volumes and  Amazon  EBS  snapshots  created
          from  gateway  volumes  are changing to a longer format. Starting in
          December 2016, all new volumes and snapshots will be created with  a
          17-character string. Starting in April 2016, you will be able to use
          these longer IDs so you can test your systems with the  new  format.
          For more information, see Longer EC2 and EBS resource IDs .

          For  example,  a  volume  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) with the longer
          volume ID format looks like the following:
              arn:aws:storagegateway:us-west-2:111122223333:gate-
              way/sgw-12A3456B/volume/vol-1122AABBCCDDEEFFG .

          A  snapshot  ID  with the longer ID format looks like the following:
          snap-78e226633445566ee .

          For more information, see  Announcement:  Heads-up   Longer  Storage
          Gateway volume and snapshot IDs coming in 2016 .
