DESCRIPTION
       Creates a snapshot of a DB cluster.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-db-cluster-snapshot
          --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier <value>
          --db-cluster-identifier <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The  identifier of the DB cluster snapshot. This parameter is stored
          as a lowercase string.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

          o First character must be a letter.

          o Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

          Example: my-cluster1-snapshot1

       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the DB cluster to  create  a  snapshot  for.  This
          parameter is not case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must match the identifier of an existing DBCluster.

          Example: my-cluster1

       --tags (list)
          The tags to be assigned to the DB cluster snapshot.

          (structure)
              Metadata  assigned to an Amazon Neptune resource consisting of a
              key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 A key is the required name of the tag. The string  value  can
                 be  from  1  to 128 Unicode characters in length and can't be
                 prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain  the
                 set  of  Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_', '.', '/',
                 '=', '+', '-' (Java regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A  value  is  the optional value of the tag. The string value
                 can be from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length  and  can't
                 be  prefixed  with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain
                 the set of Unicode letters, digits,  white-space,  '_',  '.',
                 '/',       '=',       '+',       '-'       (Java       regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DBClusterSnapshot -> (structure)
          Contains the details for an Amazon Neptune DB cluster snapshot

          This data type is used as a response element in the  DescribeDBClus-
          terSnapshots action.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              Provides  the  list  of EC2 Availability Zones that instances in
              the DB cluster snapshot can be restored in.

              (string)

          DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier -> (string)
              Specifies the identifier for a DB cluster snapshot.  Must  match
              the identifier of an existing snapshot.

              After  you restore a DB cluster using a DBClusterSnapshotIdenti-
              fier , you must specify the same DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier for
              any  future  updates  to  the  DB cluster. When you specify this
              property for an update, the DB cluster is not restored from  the
              snapshot again, and the data in the database is not changed.

              However,  if you don't specify the DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier ,
              an empty DB cluster is created, and the original DB  cluster  is
              deleted.  If  you  specify a property that is different from the
              previous snapshot restore property, the DB cluster  is  restored
              from the snapshot specified by the DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier ,
              and the original DB cluster is deleted.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Specifies the DB cluster identifier of the DB cluster that  this
              DB cluster snapshot was created from.

          SnapshotCreateTime -> (timestamp)
              Provides  the  time  when  the  snapshot was taken, in Universal
              Coordinated Time (UTC).

          Engine -> (string)
              Specifies the name of the database engine.

          AllocatedStorage -> (integer)
              Specifies the allocated storage size in gibibytes (GiB).

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the status of this DB cluster snapshot.

          Port -> (integer)
              Specifies the port that the DB cluster was listening on  at  the
              time of the snapshot.

          VpcId -> (string)
              Provides the VPC ID associated with the DB cluster snapshot.

          ClusterCreateTime -> (timestamp)
              Specifies the time when the DB cluster was created, in Universal
              Coordinated Time (UTC).

          MasterUsername -> (string)
              Not supported by Neptune.

          EngineVersion -> (string)
              Provides the version of the database engine for this DB  cluster
              snapshot.

          LicenseModel -> (string)
              Provides the license model information for this DB cluster snap-
              shot.

          SnapshotType -> (string)
              Provides the type of the DB cluster snapshot.

          PercentProgress -> (integer)
              Specifies the percentage of the estimated  data  that  has  been
              transferred.

          StorageEncrypted -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether the DB cluster snapshot is encrypted.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              If  StorageEncrypted  is true, the Amazon KMS key identifier for
              the encrypted DB cluster snapshot.

          DBClusterSnapshotArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the DB cluster snapshot.

          SourceDBClusterSnapshotArn -> (string)
              If the DB cluster snapshot was copied from a source  DB  cluster
              snapshot, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the source DB clus-
              ter snapshot, otherwise, a null value.

          IAMDatabaseAuthenticationEnabled -> (boolean)
