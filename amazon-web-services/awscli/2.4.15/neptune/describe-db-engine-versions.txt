DESCRIBE-DB-ENGINE-VERSIONS()                    DESCRIBE-DB-ENGINE-VERSIONS()



NAME
       describe-db-engine-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of the available DB engines.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-db-engine-versions  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API
       calls may be issued in  order  to  retrieve  the  entire  data  set  of
       results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by providing the --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: DBEngineVersions

OPTIONS
       --engine (string)
          The database engine to return.

       --engine-version (string)
          The database engine version to return.

          Example: 5.1.49

       --db-parameter-group-family (string)
          The name of a specific DB parameter group family to  return  details
          for.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match an existing DBParameterGroupFamily.

       --filters (list)
          Not currently supported.

          (structure)
              This type is not currently supported.

              Name -> (string)
                 This parameter is not currently supported.

              Values -> (list)
                 This parameter is not currently supported.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --default-only | --no-default-only (boolean)
          Indicates  that  only the default version of the specified engine or
          engine and major version combination is returned.

       --list-supported-character-sets  |   --no-list-supported-character-sets
       (boolean)
          If this parameter is specified and the requested engine supports the
          CharacterSetName  parameter  for  CreateDBInstance  ,  the  response
          includes a list of supported character sets for each engine version.

       --list-supported-timezones | --no-list-supported-timezones (boolean)
          If this parameter is specified and the requested engine supports the
          TimeZone  parameter  for  CreateDBInstance , the response includes a
          list of supported time zones for each engine version.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter is specified, the response includes  only  records  beyond
          the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .
