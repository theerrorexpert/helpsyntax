MODIFY-EVENT-SUBSCRIPTION()                        MODIFY-EVENT-SUBSCRIPTION()



NAME
       modify-event-subscription -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  an  existing  event  notification subscription. Note that you
       can't modify the source identifiers using this call; to  change  source
       identifiers for a subscription, use the  AddSourceIdentifierToSubscrip-
       tion and  RemoveSourceIdentifierFromSubscription calls.

       You can see a list of the event categories for a  given  SourceType  by
       using the DescribeEventCategories action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-event-subscription
          --subscription-name <value>
          [--sns-topic-arn <value>]
          [--source-type <value>]
          [--event-categories <value>]
          [--enabled | --no-enabled]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subscription-name (string)
          The name of the event notification subscription.

       --sns-topic-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the SNS topic created for event
          notification. The ARN is created by Amazon SNS  when  you  create  a
          topic and subscribe to it.

       --source-type (string)
          The  type  of  source that is generating the events. For example, if
          you want to be notified of events generated by a  DB  instance,  you
          would set this parameter to db-instance. if this value is not speci-
          fied, all events are returned.

          Valid values: db-instance | db-parameter-group | db-security-group |
          db-snapshot

       --event-categories (list)
          A  list  of  event categories for a SourceType that you want to sub-
          scribe to. You can see a list of the categories for a given  Source-
          Type by using the DescribeEventCategories action.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --enabled | --no-enabled (boolean)
          A Boolean value; set to true to activate the subscription.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          Contains   the   results   of   a   successful   invocation  of  the

          CustomerAwsId -> (string)
              The Amazon customer account associated with the event  notifica-
              tion subscription.

          CustSubscriptionId -> (string)

          SourceIdsList -> (list)
              A list of source IDs for the event notification subscription.

              (string)

          EventCategoriesList -> (list)
              A  list of event categories for the event notification subscrip-
              tion.

              (string)

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              A Boolean value indicating if the subscription is enabled.  True
