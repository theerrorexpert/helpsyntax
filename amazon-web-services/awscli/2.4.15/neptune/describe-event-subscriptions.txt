NAME
       describe-event-subscriptions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  the  subscription  descriptions for a customer account. The
       description for a subscription includes SubscriptionName,  SNSTopicARN,
       CustomerID, SourceType, SourceID, CreationTime, and Status.

       If  you specify a SubscriptionName, lists the description for that sub-
       scription.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-event-subscriptions is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in  order  to  retrieve  the entire data set of
       results. You can disable  pagination  by  providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: EventSubscriptionsList

SYNOPSIS
            describe-event-subscriptions
          [--subscription-name <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subscription-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  event  notification  subscription  you  want  to
          describe.

       --filters (list)
          This parameter is not currently supported.

          (structure)
              This type is not currently supported.

              Name -> (string)
                 This parameter is not currently supported.

              Values -> (list)
                 This parameter is not currently supported.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results  in  more  calls  to  the  AWS  service,
          retrieving  fewer  items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          An  optional  pagination token provided by a previous DescribeOrder-
          ableDBInstanceOptions request. If this parameter is  specified,  the
          response  includes  only  records beyond the marker, up to the value
          specified by MaxRecords .

       EventSubscriptionsList -> (list)
          A list of EventSubscriptions data types.

          (structure)
              Contains  the  results  of  a  successful  invocation   of   the
              DescribeEventSubscriptions action.

              CustomerAwsId -> (string)
                 The Amazon customer account associated with the event notifi-
                 cation subscription.

              CustSubscriptionId -> (string)
                 The event notification subscription Id.

              SnsTopicArn -> (string)
                 The topic ARN of the event notification subscription.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the event notification subscription.

                 Constraints:

                 Can be one of the following: creating | modifying |  deleting
                 | active | no-permission | topic-not-exist

                 The  status  "no-permission" indicates that Neptune no longer
                 has  permission  to  post  to  the  SNS  topic.  The   status
                 "topic-not-exist"  indicates that the topic was deleted after
                 the subscription was created.

              SubscriptionCreationTime -> (string)
                 The time the event notification subscription was created.

              SourceType -> (string)
                 The source type for the event notification subscription.

              SourceIdsList -> (list)
                 A list of source IDs for the event notification subscription.

                 (string)

              EventCategoriesList -> (list)
                 A  list  of  event categories for the event notification sub-
                 scription.

                 (string)

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 A Boolean value indicating if the  subscription  is  enabled.
                 True indicates the subscription is enabled.

              EventSubscriptionArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the event subscription.
