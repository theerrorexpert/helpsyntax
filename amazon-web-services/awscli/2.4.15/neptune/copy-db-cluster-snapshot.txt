COPY-DB-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOT()                          COPY-DB-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       copy-db-cluster-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Copies a snapshot of a DB cluster.

       To copy a DB cluster snapshot from a shared manual DB cluster snapshot,
       SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier must  be  the  Amazon  Resource  Name
       (ARN) of the shared DB cluster snapshot.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            copy-db-cluster-snapshot
          --source-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier <value>
          --target-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier <value>
          [--kms-key-id <value>]
          [--pre-signed-url <value>]
          [--copy-tags | --no-copy-tags]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--source-region <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the DB cluster snapshot to copy. This parameter is
          not case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must specify a valid system snapshot in the "available" state.

          o Specify a valid DB snapshot identifier.

          Example: my-cluster-snapshot1

       --target-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the new DB cluster snapshot  to  create  from  the
          source DB cluster snapshot. This parameter is not case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

          o First character must be a letter.

          o Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

          Example: my-cluster-snapshot2

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The  Amazon  Amazon KMS key ID for an encrypted DB cluster snapshot.
          The KMS key ID is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN),  KMS  key  identi-
          fier, or the KMS key alias for the KMS encryption key.

          If  you  copy  an  encrypted  DB  cluster  snapshot from your Amazon
          account, you can specify a value for KmsKeyId to  encrypt  the  copy
          with  a  new  KMS  encryption  key. If you don't specify a value for
          KmsKeyId , then the copy of the DB  cluster  snapshot  is  encrypted
          with the same KMS key as the source DB cluster snapshot.

          If  you  copy  an  encrypted DB cluster snapshot that is shared from
          another Amazon account, then you must specify a value for KmsKeyId .

          KMS  encryption keys are specific to the Amazon Region that they are
          created in, and you can't use encryption keys from one Amazon Region
          in another Amazon Region.

          You  cannot encrypt an unencrypted DB cluster snapshot when you copy
          it. If you try to copy an unencrypted DB cluster snapshot and  spec-
          ify a value for the KmsKeyId parameter, an error is returned.

       --pre-signed-url (string)
          Not currently supported.

       --copy-tags | --no-copy-tags (boolean)
          True  to  copy  all  tags from the source DB cluster snapshot to the
          target DB cluster snapshot, and  otherwise  false.  The  default  is
          false.

       --tags (list)
          The tags to assign to the new DB cluster snapshot copy.

          (structure)
              Metadata  assigned to an Amazon Neptune resource consisting of a
              key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 A key is the required name of the tag. The string  value  can
                 be  from  1  to 128 Unicode characters in length and can't be
                 prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain  the
                 set  of  Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_', '.', '/',
                 '=', '+', '-' (Java regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A  value  is  the optional value of the tag. The string value
                 can be from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length  and  can't
                 be  prefixed  with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain
                 the set of Unicode letters, digits,  white-space,  '_',  '.',
                 '/',       '=',       '+',       '-'       (Java       regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --source-region (string)
          The ID of the region that contains the snapshot to be copied.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DBClusterSnapshot -> (structure)
          Contains the details for an Amazon Neptune DB cluster snapshot

          This data type is used as a response element in the  DescribeDBClus-
          terSnapshots action.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              Provides  the  list  of EC2 Availability Zones that instances in
              the DB cluster snapshot can be restored in.

              (string)

          DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier -> (string)
              Specifies the identifier for a DB cluster snapshot.  Must  match
              the identifier of an existing snapshot.

              After  you restore a DB cluster using a DBClusterSnapshotIdenti-
              fier , you must specify the same DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier for
              any  future  updates  to  the  DB cluster. When you specify this
              property for an update, the DB cluster is not restored from  the
              snapshot again, and the data in the database is not changed.

              However,  if you don't specify the DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier ,
              an empty DB cluster is created, and the original DB  cluster  is
              deleted.  If  you  specify a property that is different from the
              previous snapshot restore property, the DB cluster  is  restored
              from the snapshot specified by the DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier ,
              and the original DB cluster is deleted.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Specifies the DB cluster identifier of the DB cluster that  this
              DB cluster snapshot was created from.

          SnapshotCreateTime -> (timestamp)

          Port -> (integer)
              Specifies the port that the DB cluster was listening on  at  the
              time of the snapshot.

              Coordinated Time (UTC).

          MasterUsername -> (string)
              Not supported by Neptune.

          EngineVersion -> (string)
              Provides the version of the database engine for this DB  cluster
              snapshot.

          PercentProgress -> (integer)
              Specifies the percentage of the estimated  data  that  has  been
              transferred.

          StorageEncrypted -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether the DB cluster snapshot is encrypted.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              If  StorageEncrypted  is true, the Amazon KMS key identifier for
              the encrypted DB cluster snapshot.

          DBClusterSnapshotArn -> (string)

              snapshot, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the source DB clus-
              ter snapshot, otherwise, a null value.
